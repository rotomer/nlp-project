     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or

alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
          (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection except to the extent that it has been prejudiced by such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff that is not subject to further appeal, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened
 
proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits for the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits for the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) from the sale of all Securities to be sold pursuant to this Agreement bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company or its affiliates on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of
 
Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company and the Selling Shareholder shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company and the Selling Shareholder that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company and the Selling Shareholder notify the Representatives that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company and the Selling Shareholder, as the case may be, shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company and the Selling Shareholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Securities, then the Company and the Selling Shareholder shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company and the Selling Shareholder as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of
 
Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one tenth of the aggregate number of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company and the Selling Shareholder shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities (or, with respect to each Second Time of Delivery, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Selling Shareholder to sell the Optional Securities) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company or the Selling Shareholder, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Selling Shareholder and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company or the Selling Shareholder, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated, or if this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriters, because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 8 hereof is not satisfied (other than any termination pursuant to clause (i), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 8(h) hereof), or because of any refusal, inability or failure of parties hereto (other than the Underwriters) to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement or the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Securities except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of the Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
     14. All statements, requests, notices and advices hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to an Underwriter, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the notice address set forth in , if to the Company shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to 180 Maiden Lane, New York, New York 10038, Facsimile Transmission No. (212) 770-3500, Attention: General Counsel, and if to the Selling Shareholder, shall be sufficient in all respects when delivered or sent by registered mail to the United States Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,

     15. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and the Selling Shareholder and, to the extent provided in Section 9 and Section 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns; and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (a) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (b) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (c) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (d) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
     17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) among all of the Company, the Selling Shareholder and the Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall alter or supersede the Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of January 14, 2011, between the Company and the Selling Shareholder.
     18. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York; that all rights and obligations of the Selling Shareholder under this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the federal law of the United States of America. To the extent that a court looks to the laws of any State to determine or define the United States federal law, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such court shall look only to the laws of the State of New York without regard to its rules of conflicts of laws.
provided
          (b) Each party to this Agreement other than the Selling Shareholder irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding against it arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered against it in connection with this Agreement may be brought only in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, such party hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the jurisdiction of each of the aforesaid courts , generally and unconditionally with respect to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, assets and revenues. Each party other than the Selling Shareholder hereby also irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any
in personam
 
such court and any claim that any such action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
     19. The Company hereby confirms that neither it nor its property located in the United States is entitled to assert a defense of sovereign immunity (whether from jurisdiction, service of process or attachment) in any legal action, suit or proceeding based on this Agreement which may be instituted in any federal, state or local court in the United States.
     20. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement.
     21. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us nine counterparts hereof, whereupon this letter and the acceptance by each of you thereof shall constitute a binding agreement among the Company, the Selling Shareholder and the Underwriters.

Schedule I
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 24, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Selling Shareholder") and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of 100,000,000 shares (the "Primary Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), from the Company, and of 200,000,000 shares (the "Secondary Securities" and, together with the Primary Securities, the "Securities") of Common Stock from the Selling Shareholder, we, as
 
counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that:
     1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     2. All outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, including the Securities, have been duly authorizedand validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and the holders of outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are not entitled to any preemptive rights to subscribe for the Securities under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
     3. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Primary Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus relating to the Securities, would not be on the date hereof, an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     4. All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Covered Laws for the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement have been obtained or made.
     5. The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Underwriting Agreement will not violate any Covered Laws, except for such violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities.
     6. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement will not, (a) violate the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, or (b) result in a default under or breach of any of the agreements listed on Annex A hereto, except in the case of clause (b) for such defaults or breaches that would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities; , , that we are expressing no opinion in clause (b) of this paragraph as to compliance with any financial or accounting test, or any limitation or restriction expressed as a dollar amount, ratio or percentage.
provided
however
 
     7. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
          We are expressing no opinion in paragraphs (4) and (5) above, insofar as performance by the Company of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement is concerned, as to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights. Also, for purposes of the opinions in paragraphs (4) and (5) above, "Covered Laws" means the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including in each case the published rules or regulations thereunder) that in our experience normally are applicable to general business corporations and transactions such as those contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement; , , that, for purposes of paragraph (5) above, such term does not include Federal securities laws and, for purposes of paragraphs (4) and (5) above, such term does not include state securities laws, insurance laws of any jurisdiction, antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, antitrust laws or any law that is applicable to the Company, the Underwriting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby solely as part of a regulatory regime applicable to the Company or its affiliates due to its or their status, business or assets.
provided
however
          We have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the certificates for the outstanding shares of Common Stock conform to the specimen thereof examined by us and have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock and that the Securities have been duly recorded by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar thereof in the direct registration system of the Company, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
          This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and offering of 100,000,000 shares (the "Primary Securities") of American International Group, Inc.'s (the "Company") common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), by the Company and offering of 200,000,000 shares (the "Secondary Securities" and, together with the Primary Securities, the "Securities") of Common Stock by the United States Department of Treasury.
          The Registration Statement relating to the Securities (File No. 333-160645) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information
 
relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statement was amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 and a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 thereto (together, the "Post-Effective Amendments"), and any reference in this letter to the "Registration Statement" refers to the Registration Statement as amended by the Post-Effective Amendments. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus, dated April 5, 2011 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 24, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
          As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents and information listed in Schedule A (those listed documents and information, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its accountants and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Also, we confirm to you that the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Common Stock" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Common Stock," "Certain United States Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders of Common Stock" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Securities therein described or insofar as they relate to provisions of United States Federal tax law therein described, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects.
          Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
 
     (a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
     (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:30 P.M. on May 24, 2011, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the preceding paragraph has caused us to believe that the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except to the extent specifically noted in the last sentence of the second preceding paragraph. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to management's report of its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' report thereon, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package.
          This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
Very truly yours,

Schedule I
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          I am Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company.
          This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 24, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Selling Shareholder") and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of
 
100,000,000 shares (the "Primary Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), from the Company, and of 200,000,000 shares (the "Secondary Securities" and, together with the Primary Securities, the "Securities") of Common Stock from the Selling Shareholder.
          The Registration Statement relating to the Securities (File No. 333-160645) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statement was amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 and a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 thereto (together, the "Post-Effective Amendments"), and any reference in this letter to the "Registration Statement" refers to the Registration Statement as amended by the Post-Effective Amendments. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated April 5, 2011 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 24, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
          In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents and information listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents and information, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below) being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:
          (i) The Company has authorized capital stock as set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation; all outstanding shares of Common Stock, including the Securities, have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; and the holders of outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are not entitled to any preemptive rights to subscribe for the Securities under the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
          (ii) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or as exhibits to the documents incorporated by reference therein other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as
 
exhibits thereto or to such documents incorporated by reference, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed and properly described therein;
          (iii) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; the Company has corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its businesses as described in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement;
          (iv) Each of the subsidiaries of the Company named on Annex I has been duly incorporated or organized and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation; and each of such subsidiaries has corporate power and authority to own its respective properties and to conduct its respective business as described in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, except where the failure to have such power would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement);
          (v) The issue and sale of the Primary Securities by the Company, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or other governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof or in a violation of any Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including in each case the published rules or regulations thereunder) that in my experience normally would be applicable to general business corporations and transactions such as those contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement; provided, however, that I am expressing no opinion in this paragraph as to the effect of Federal or state securities laws, other antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, antitrust laws or any law that is applicable to the Company, the Underwriting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby solely as part of a regulatory regime applicable to the Company or its affiliates due to its or their status, business or assets. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issue and sale of the Primary Securities by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations and qualifications required to list the
 
Securities on the New York Stock Exchange, such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities or such as have been obtained under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") or may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement;
          (vi) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
(a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:30 P.M. on May 24, 2011 (the "Applicable Time"), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
          (vii) The statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, under the captions "Description of Common Stock" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of Common Stock" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities and the Underwriting Agreement, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects; and
          (viii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
          In rendering the opinion in paragraph (vi), I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the
 
Pricing Disclosure Package, except to the extent specifically noted in paragraphs (i) and (vii). Also, in rendering the opinion in paragraphs (vi) and (viii), I do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to management's report of its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' report as to the Company's internal control over financial reporting, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and only with respect to the opinion in (iv) above, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the general corporation and insurance laws of the State of Arizona and the State of Texas, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. In rendering the opinion in (iv) above, (i) insofar as it concerns SunAmerica Life Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated May [27], 2011, of [Chris Nixon, General Counsel] of SunAmerica Life Insurance Company, (ii) insofar as it concerns The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated May [27], 2011, of [Jim Coppedge, General Counsel] of The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, (iii) insofar as it concerns American General Life Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated May [27], 2011, of [Kyle L. Jennings, General Counsel] of American General Life Insurance Company, and (iv) insofar as it concerns American Home Assurance Company, Commerce and Industry Insurance Company, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. and Lexington Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated May [27], 2011, of [Thomas J. Scherer, General Counsel of Chartis Inc.], copies of each of which [are attached hereto and] have been delivered to you pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Underwriting Agreement, and in each case my opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations with respect to such matters as are contained in such opinions.
          I have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the certificates for the outstanding shares of Common Stock conform to the specimen thereof examined by me and have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar of the Common Stock and the Securities have been duly recorded by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar thereof in the direct registration system of the Company, and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
          This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
Very truly yours,

     Re:
American International Group, Inc.  Lock-Up Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     The undersigned understands that you, as representatives (the "Representatives"), propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") on behalf of the several Underwriters to be named in Schedule I to such agreement (collectively, the "Underwriters"), with American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), providing for a public offering of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-160645) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
     In consideration of the agreement by the Underwriters to offer and sell the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Shares"), and of other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees that, during the period (the "Lock-up Period") beginning from the date hereof and continuing to and including the date 120 days after the date of the final prospectus covering the public offering of the Shares, the undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale, otherwise dispose of or publicly announce an intention to
 
effect any such transaction with respect to any shares of Common Stock of the Company, or any options or warrants to purchase any shares of Common Stock of the Company, or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of Common Stock of the Company, whether now owned or hereinafter acquired, owned directly by the undersigned (including holding as a custodian) or with respect to which the undersigned has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest within the rules and regulations of the SEC (collectively the "Undersigned's Shares").
     The foregoing restriction is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to result in a sale or disposition of the Undersigned's Shares even if such shares would be disposed of by any person in privity with the undersigned. Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or establishment or increase of a put equivalent position or the liquidation or decrease of a call equivalent position (other than the expiration, conversion or termination, in accordance with its terms, of a call equivalent position in existence as of the date hereof) within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), with respect to any of the Undersigned's Shares or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such shares. The undersigned further agrees that the foregoing provisions shall be equally applicable to any issuer-directed Shares the undersigned may purchase in the offering.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may transfer the Undersigned's Shares (i) as a gift or gifts, provided that the donee or donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the immediate family (as defined in Rule 16a-1(e) under the Exchange Act) of the undersigned, provided that the trustee of the trust agrees to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value, (iii) in any other transaction that would not be required to be reported pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as a result of the undersigned no longer being an executive officer or director for Section 16(a) reporting purposes, provided that no filing under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act shall be voluntarily made during the Lock-up Period; (iv) up to 50,000 additional shares of Common Stock or (v) with the prior written consent of the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the Undersigned's Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.
bona fide
     This Lock-Up Agreement shall be terminated and the undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this Lock-Up Agreement if (i) the Underwriting Agreement is not signed by June 15, 2011, (ii) the Underwriting Agreement (other than the provisions thereof that survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the Shares, or (iii) the Company's public offering of the Common Stock pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-160645) is abandoned.
 
     The undersigned understands that the Company and the Underwriters are relying upon this Lock-Up Agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the offering. The undersigned further understands that this Lock-Up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal representatives, successors, and assigns.

Exhibit 5.1
May 27, 2011
American International Group, Inc.           180 Maiden Lane,                New York, NY 10038.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the several purchases today by the Underwriters (the "Underwriters") named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated May 24, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the United States Department of the Treasury and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several Underwriters, of an aggregate of 300,000,000 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share, I, as Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined such
 
American International Group, Inc.
corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Each Security has a related share purchase right (each, a "Right")issued pursuant to the Tax Asset Protection Plan, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the "Plan"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").
     Upon the basis of such examination, I advise you, in my opinion, that:
     (1) the Securities have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; and
     (2) the Rights attributable to the Securities have been validly issued.
     In connection with my opinion set forth in paragraph (2) above, I note that the question whether the Board of Directors of the Company might be required to redeem the Rights at some future time will depend upon the facts and circumstances existing at that time and, accordingly, is beyond the scope of such opinion.
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and I am
 
American International Group, Inc.
expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     I have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the certificates for the Securities, if any, have been duly countersigned by a transfer agent and the Securities have been duly recorded by a transfer agent and duly registered by a registrar thereof in the direct registration system of the Company, that the Plan has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Rights Agent and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
     I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement (File No. 333-160645) and to the reference to me under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Securities, dated May 24, 2011. In giving such consent, I
 
American International Group, Inc.
do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Kathleen E. Shannon

(the "Company") in connection with the offering of 100,000,000 shares (the "Primary Securities") of the Company's common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), by the Company and the offering of 200,000,000 shares (the "Secondary Securities" and, together with the Primary Securities, the "Securities") of Common Stock by the United States Department of Treasury, as described in the prospectus supplement dated May 24, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), we hereby confirm to you that the statements contained in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain United States Federal Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders", insofar as they relate to provisions of United States Federal tax law therein described, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects, subject to the limitations set forth therein.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement relating to the Securities. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933.
