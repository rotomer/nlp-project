     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse such Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use therein.
provided
however
 
          (b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such controlling person may become subject, under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection except to the extent that it has been prejudiced by such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff that is not subject to further appeal, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on
 
claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters of Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
 
          (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act; provided that the Underwriters shall have no obligation to indemnify any department, agency or instrumentality of the United States federal government.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Securities for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 10 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement relating to such Securities and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
          (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to
 
require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement relating to such Securities shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated, or if this Agreement is terminated by the Underwriters, because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 8 hereof is not satisfied (other than any termination pursuant to clause (i), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 8(h) hereof), or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been reasonably incurred by them in connection with this Agreement or the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Securities except as provided in Section 7 and Section 9 hereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 8, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company"), and you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.250% Notes Due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.875% Notes Due 2016 (the "2016 Notes", together with the 2014 Notes, the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 12, 2006, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2007, and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 3, 2010 (as so supplemented, the "Original Indenture"), and as further supplemented by the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture and the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture, each to be dated as of September 13, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indentures," and together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), we, as counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have
 
considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that:
          (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
          (2) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939; the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
          (3) The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds as described in the Prospectus relating to the Securities, would not be on the date hereof, an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          (4) All regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the Covered Laws for the execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement (the "Covered Documents") have been obtained or made.
          (5) The execution and delivery by the Company of, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under, the Covered Documents will not violate any Covered Laws, except for such violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) or affect the validity of the Securities.
          (6) The execution and delivery by the Company of the Covered Documents do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Covered Documents will not, (a) violate the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Company's By-laws, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, or (b) result in a default under or breach of any of the agreements listed on Annex A hereto, except in the case of clause (b) for such defaults or breaches that would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities; , , that we are expressing no opinion in clause (b) of this paragraph as to compliance with any financial or accounting test, or any limitation or restriction expressed as a dollar amount, ratio or percentage.
provided
however
          (7) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of
 
Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
          We are expressing no opinion in paragraphs (4) and (5) above, insofar as performance by the Company of its obligations under any Covered Document is concerned, as to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights. Also, for purposes of the opinions in paragraphs (4) and (5) above, "Covered Laws" means the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including in each case the published rules or regulations thereunder) that in our experience normally are applicable to general business corporations and transactions such as those contemplated by the Covered Documents; , , that, for purposes of paragraph (5) above, such term does not include Federal securities laws and, for purposes of paragraphs (4) and (5) above, such term does not include state securities laws, insurance laws of any jurisdiction, antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, antitrust laws or any law that is applicable to the Company, the Covered Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby solely as part of a regulatory regime applicable to the Company or its affiliates due to its or their status, business or assets.
provided
however
          We have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the respective specimens thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
          This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          This is with reference to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and offering of $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Notes Due 2014 and $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Notes Due 2016 (collectively, the "Securities") of American International Group, Inc. (the "Company").
          The Registration Statement relating to the Securities (File No. 333-160645) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statement was amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 and a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 thereto (together, the "Post-Effective Amendments"), and any reference in this letter to the "Registration Statement" refers to the Registration Statement as amended by the Post-Effective Amendments. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated April 5, 2011 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated September 8, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as
 
supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
          As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus, being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Prospectus Supplement and the time of delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company, its auditors and its counsel concerning certain matters relating to the Company and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, letters addressed to you from the Company's auditors and an opinion addressed to you from counsel to the Company. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of our understanding of the applicable law (including the requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus contemplated thereby) and the experience we have gained through our practice under the Act, we confirm to you that, in our opinion, the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects relevant to the offering of the Securities, to the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. Also, we confirm to you that the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement under the captions "Description of Debt Securities AIG May Offer" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of the Notes" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued and the Underwriting Agreement relating to the Securities therein described, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects.
          Further, nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
          (a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
          (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:30 p.m. on September 8, 2011, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
 
          (c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of the preceding paragraph has caused us to believe that the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
          The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the registration process are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except to the extent specifically noted in the last sentence of the second preceding paragraph. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to management's report of its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' report as to the Company's internal control over financial reporting, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Securities are being issued.
          This letter is furnished by us, as counsel to the Company, to you, as Representatives of the several Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This letter may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
          I am Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, as such, I am generally familiar with the corporate affairs of the Company.
          This opinion is rendered in connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 8, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Representatives of the several
 
Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), of $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.250% Notes Due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.875% Notes Due 2016 (together with the 2014 Notes, the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 12, 2006, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2007, and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 3, 2010 (as so supplemented, the "Original Indenture"), and as further supplemented by Eleventh Supplemental Indenture and the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture, each to be dated as of September 13, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indentures," and together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee").
          The Registration Statement relating to the Securities (File No. 333-160645) was filed on Form S-3 in accordance with procedures of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") permitting a delayed or continuous offering of securities pursuant thereto and, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, document incorporated by reference therein or prospectus supplement that provides information relating to the terms of the securities and the manner of their distribution. The Registration Statement was amended by a Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 and a Post-Effective Amendment No. 2 thereto (together, the "Post-Effective Amendments"), and any reference in this letter to the "Registration Statement" refers to the Registration Statement as amended by the Post-Effective Amendments. The Securities have been offered by the Prospectus dated April 5, 2011 (the "Basic Prospectus"), as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, dated September 8, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which updates or supplements certain information contained in the Basic Prospectus. The Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, does not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since, pursuant to Form S-3, it incorporates by reference certain documents filed with the Commission that contain information as of various dates.
          In rendering my opinion, I, as Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, have examined the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement and the documents listed in Schedule A hereto (those listed documents, taken together with the Basic Prospectus as amended or supplemented immediately prior to the Applicable Time (as defined below), being referred to herein as the "Pricing Disclosure Package"), and I have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and have reviewed such questions of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:
     (i) To the best of my knowledge and information, there are no contracts or other documents required to be summarized or disclosed or filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or as exhibits to the documents incorporated by reference therein other than those summarized or disclosed in the Registration Statement or filed as exhibits thereto or to such documents incorporated by reference, and there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened of a character required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, which are not disclosed and properly described therein;
     (ii) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware; the Company has corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its businesses as described in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement;
 
     (iii) Each of the subsidiaries of the Company named on Annex I has been duly incorporated or organized and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation; and each of such subsidiaries has corporate power and authority to own its respective properties and to conduct its respective business as described in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, except where the failure to have such power would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement);
     (iv) The issue and sale of the Securities, and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement will not result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, or other material agreement or instrument in effect on the date hereof and known to me, to which the Company is a party or by which the Company may be bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company is subject or violate any judgment, order or decree of any court or other governmental body applicable to the Company, except for such breaches, defaults and violations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Company in effect on the date hereof or in a violation of any Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including in each case the published rules or regulations thereunder) that in my experience normally would be applicable to general business corporations and transactions such as those contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement; provided, however, that I am expressing no opinion in this paragraph as to the effect of Federal or state securities laws, other antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws, tax laws, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, antitrust laws or any law that is applicable to the Company, the Underwriting Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby solely as part of a regulatory regime applicable to the Company or its affiliates due to its or their status, business or assets. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or any regulatory authority or other governmental body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and except for such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications the failure to obtain or make would not have a Material Adverse Effect or affect the validity of the Securities or as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws (including insurance laws of any state relating to offers and sales of securities in such state) in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement;
     (v) Nothing which came to my attention has caused me to believe that, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities,
     (a) the Registration Statement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
     (b) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of 5:30 p.m. on September 8, 2011 (the "Applicable Time"), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
 
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
     (c) the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date of the Prospectus Supplement and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (vi) The statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, under the captions "Description of Debt Securities AIG May Offer" in the Basic Prospectus and "Description of the Notes" and "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement, in each case insofar as they relate to provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, constitute a fair and accurate summary of such provisions in all material respects; and
     (vii) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, as of the date they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, complied as to form in all material respects with the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
          In rendering the opinion in paragraph (v), I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, except to the extent specifically noted in paragraph (vi). Also, in rendering the opinion in paragraphs (v), (vi) and (vii), I do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data derived from accounting records contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to management's report of its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting or the auditors' report as to the Company's internal control over financial reporting, each as included in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or the Pricing Disclosure Package, or as to the statement of the eligibility and qualification of the Trustee.
          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and only with respect to the opinion in (iii) above, the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the general corporation and insurance laws of the State of Arizona and the State of Texas, and I am expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction. In rendering the opinion in (iii) above, (A) insofar as it concerns SunAmerica Life Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated September 13, 2011, of Christine Nixon, General Counsel of SunAmerica Life Insurance Company, (B) insofar as it concerns The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated September 13, 2011, of Jim Coppedge, General Counsel of The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, (C) insofar as it concerns American General Life Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated September 13, 2011, of Kyle L. Jennings, General Counsel of American General Life Insurance Company, and (D) insofar as it concerns American Home Assurance Company, Commerce and Industry Insurance Company, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. and Lexington Insurance Company, I have relied on the opinion dated September 13, 2011, of Thomas Scherer, General Counsel of Chartis Inc., and in each case
 
my opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations with respect to such matters as are contained in such opinions.
          I have also relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by me to be responsible, and I have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the respective specimens thereof examined by me, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by me are genuine, assumptions which I have not independently verified.
          This letter is furnished by me, as Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel of the Company, to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such, and may not be relied upon by any other person. This opinion may not be quoted, referred to or furnished to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Securities and may not be used in furtherance of any offer or sale of the Securities.
Very truly yours,

     AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or its registered assigns, the principal sum of ____________________ Dollars ($___________) on September 15, 2016, and to pay interest thereon from September 13, 2011, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semiannually in arrears on each March 15 and September 15 (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing on March 15, 2012 at the rate of 4.875% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the March 1 or September 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

     In the event that an Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, the Company shall pay interest on the next day that is a Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, and without any interest or other payment with respect to the delay. If the Stated Maturity or earlier Redemption Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, with the same force and effect as if made on the Stated Maturity or earlier Redemption Date, provided that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Stated Maturity or earlier Redemption Date.

     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.

Exhibit 5.1
September 13, 2011
American International Group, Inc.,      180 Maiden Lane,           New York, NY 10038.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the several purchases today by the Underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 8, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., as representatives of the several Underwriters named therein, of $1,200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.250% Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.875% Notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and, together with the 2014 Notes, the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of October 12, 2006, as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 18, 2007 and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 3, 2010, and as further supplemented by the Eleventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 13, 2011 and the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 13, 2011 (collectively, the "Indenture"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), we, as your counsel, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.
     Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion,
 
     (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     (2) The Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
     The foregoing opinion is limited to the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     We have relied as to certain factual matters on information obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other sources believed by us to be responsible, and we have assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee, that the Securities conform to the specimens thereof examined by us, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the Securities have been manually signed by one of the Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, assumptions which we have not independently verified.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933.
