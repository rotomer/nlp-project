All $1.3 billion of issued and outstanding letters of credit under the Chartis Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (referred to in Item 1.02 below) are included as letters of credit under the Four-Year Credit Agreement, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under the Four-Year Credit Agreement, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit.

In addition, the AIG Credit Agreements contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to incurrence of certain types of liens, transactions with affiliates, and certain fundamental changes.
AIG expects that it may draw down on the facilities made available under the AIG Credit Agreements from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Amounts due under the AIG Credit Agreements may be accelerated upon an "event of default," as defined in the AIG Credit Agreements, such as failure to pay amounts owed thereunder when due, breach of a covenant, material inaccuracy of a representation or occurrence of bankruptcy, subject in some cases to cure periods.

In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent (the ""), at the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate from time to time in effect and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the applicable Borrower, and such Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.

The indemnity under this Section 2.14(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any Lender making a claim under this Section 2.14(d) on behalf of any of its beneficial owners, an indemnity payment under this Section 2.14(d) shall be due only to the extent that such Lender is able to establish that, with respect to the applicable Indemnified Taxes, such beneficial owners supplied to the applicable Persons such properly completed and executed documentation necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, such Indemnified Taxes.
Indemnification by Loan Parties
          (e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) and the Loan Parties for any Excluded Taxes, in each case attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.14(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

     (F) any other form prescribed by Law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by Law to be withheld.
          (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.14(f)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
 
          (g) . If any Lender or the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that it has received a refund, in cash or applied as an offset against other cash tax liability, of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section), such indemnified party shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnifying party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any interest imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.14(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.14(g) to the extent such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.14(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
          SECTION 2.15. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
          (a) . Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or Unreimbursed Amounts, or under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m. (or, in the case of Section 2.20(c), 2:00 p.m.), New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
Payments by Borrowers
          (b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, Unreimbursed Amounts, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and Unreimbursed Amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and Unreimbursed Amounts then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments
 
          (c) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class or any Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and accrued interest thereon or Unreimbursed Amounts and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans or L/C Obligations, as applicable, of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of the applicable Class and their respective Unreimbursed Amounts; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or interests in Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
          (d) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
          (e) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), 2.15(d), 2.20(c) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent
          SECTION 2.16. .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
 
          (a) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans or Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of a Different Lending Office
          (b) . If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (in the case of any L/C Tranche Lender) an Affected Lender or a Non-NAIC Approved Bank, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse, all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (or, with respect to any such assignment as a result of such Lender becoming an Affected Lender or a Non-NAIC Approved Bank, all its interests, rights and obligations under the L/C Tranche) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (A) such assignment shall be effected in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 (including, in the case of any assignment of interests, rights and obligations under the L/C Tranche, that such assignee shall be a NAIC Approved Bank or any other Person which shall have in effect a Confirming Bank Agreement or Limited Fronting Lender Agreement, in each case, with a Person or Lender, as applicable, which is a NAIC Approved Bank) and such assignee (if not a Lender) shall have been approved by the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and Unreimbursed Amounts owing to it, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal, Unreimbursed Amounts and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), (C) with respect to an assignment as a result of clause (iii) above, the assignment fee shall be paid to the Administrative Agent by the Company and (D) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply (including, in the case of clause (iii) above with respect to any Non-NAIC Approved Bank, if, prior thereto, such Lender complies with Section 2.21(a)).
Replacement of Lenders
provided
          SECTION 2.17. . The Company may, at any time after the Closing Date by notice to the Administrative Agent, propose an increase in the total L/C Tranche Commitments or RC Tranche Commitments hereunder (each such proposed increase being a "") either by having a Lender increase its Commitment of the

Such notice shall specify (i) the name of each Increasing Lender and/or Assuming Lender, as applicable, (ii) the Class of the Commitments which is being increased, (iii) the amount of the Commitment Increase and the portion thereof being committed to by each such Increasing Lender or Assuming Lender and (iv) the date on which such Commitment Increase is to be effective (a "") (which shall be a Business Day at least five Business Days after delivery of such notice and 30 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date).

     (i) unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, the Commitment of any Assuming Lender as part of any Commitment Increase shall be in a minimum amount of at least $25,000,000;
     (ii) unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, each Commitment Increase shall be in an amount of at least $25,000,000;
     (iii) immediately after giving effect to any Commitment Increase, the total Commitments hereunder shall not exceed $3,500,000,000;
     (iv) no Default has occurred and is continuing on the relevant Commitment Increase Date or shall result from any Commitment Increase; and
     (v) the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of such representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects) on and as of the relevant Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date).
          Each Commitment Increase (and the increase of the applicable Commitment of each Increasing Lender and/or the new Commitment of each Assuming Lender, as applicable, resulting therefrom) shall become effective as of the relevant Commitment Increase Date upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date, of (a) a certificate of a Responsible Officer stating that the conditions with respect to such Commitment Increase under this Section have been satisfied and (b) an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, each such Increasing Lender and/or such Assuming Lender, as applicable, shall provide its Commitment (or an increase of its applicable Commitment, as applicable), duly executed by each such Lender and
 
the Borrowers and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent. Upon the Administrative Agent's receipt of a fully executed agreement from each such Increasing Lender and/or Assuming Lender, together with such certificate of such Responsible Officer, the Administrative Agent shall record the information contained in such agreement in the Register and give prompt notice of the relevant Commitment Increase to the Company and the Lenders (including, if applicable, each Assuming Lender). On each Commitment Increase Date, if there are Loans of the applicable Class then outstanding, each applicable Borrower shall simultaneously (i) prepay in full the outstanding Loans of such Class made to such Borrower immediately prior to giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.08 and (ii) at such Borrower's option in accordance with this Agreement, such Borrower may request to borrow new Loans of such Class from all the relevant Lenders (including, if applicable, any Assuming Lender) such that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans of such Class are held ratably by the relevant Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase).
          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to agree to increase any of its Commitments hereunder and any election to do so shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender.
          SECTION 2.18. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
          (a) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.09(a) for any period during which it is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that would otherwise have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender);
          (b) the Commitments and Credit Exposures of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); except that (i) the Commitments of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (ii) any waiver, amendment or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; and
          (c) with respect to any Several Letter of Credit and/or the L/C Obligations of such Defaulting Lender with respect thereto,
     (i) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Letter of Credit fee pursuant to Section 2.09(b) for any period during which it is a Defaulting Lender (and (except as provided in clause (c)(iii) below) the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that would otherwise have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender);
     (ii) subject to the condition that no Default has occurred and is continuing,
 
with respect to any Several Letter of Credit outstanding at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender (other than any Several Letter of Credit with respect to which another Lender has agreed to act as the Limited Fronting Lender for such Defaulting Lender), with the consent of the beneficiary thereunder to the extent required by the terms thereof or under applicable Law, (i) all or any portion of the L/C Obligations held by such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective L/C Tranche Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (A) the sum of the aggregate L/C Tranche Credit Exposure of Non-Defaulting Lenders plus the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations held by such Defaulting Lender shall not exceed the total L/C Tranche Commitments of the Non-Defaulting Lenders (except as provided in Section 2.20(k) for Limited Fronting Lenders) and (B) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations held by each Non-Defaulting Lender shall not exceed the L/C Tranche Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender (except as provided in Section 2.20(k) if such Non-Defaulting Lender is a Limited Fronting Lender) and (ii) each such Several Letter of Credit shall be amended to specify the Non-Defaulting Lenders that are parties to such Several Letter of Credit, after giving effect to such event, and such Non-Defaulting Lenders' respective L/C Tranche Applicable Percentages with respect thereto as of the effective date of such amendment (and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such Defaulting Lender shall have no obligation under each such Several Letter of Credit to the extent such L/C Obligations in respect thereof are so allocated);
     (iii) if the L/C Obligations held by the Non-Defaulting Lenders are reallocated with respect to any Several Letter of Credit pursuant to clause (c)(ii) above, then the Letter of Credit fees payable to the Lenders with respect to such Several Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.09(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders' L/C Tranche Applicable Percentages; and
     (iv) so long as such Lender remains a Defaulting Lender, the L/C Obligations of the Lenders in respect of any Several Letter of Credit requested to be issued hereunder shall be allocated among Non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with clause (c)(ii) above (and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such Defaulting Lender shall have no obligation under each such Several Letter of Credit to the extent such L/C Obligations in respect thereof are so allocated).
          In the event that the Administrative Agent, the applicable Several L/C Agent and the Company each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date, (A) to the extent the L/C Obligations held by the Non-Defaulting Lenders were theretofore reallocated with respect to any Several Letter of Credit pursuant to clause (c)(ii) or (iv) above, all adjustments shall be made to such Several Letters of Credit consistent with Section 2.20(b)(iv) (including amendments to each such Several Letter of Credit and/or, if applicable, purchases at par by such Lender of the Unreimbursed Amounts then outstanding (if any) of the other Lenders thereunder) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such L/C Obligations in accordance with its L/C Tranche Applicable Percentage; (B) if the L/C Obligations held by the Non-Defaulting Lenders were not theretofore reallocated with respect to
 
such Several Letter of Credit pursuant to clause (c)(ii) above, but instead the face amount of any such Several Letter of Credit was increased or a new Several Letter of Credit was issued hereunder in favor of the beneficiary of such Several Letter of Credit in order to provide such beneficiary with an aggregate undrawn face amount of Letters of Credit from the Non-Defaulting Lenders in the amount required by such beneficiary, the amount of such Several Letter of Credit or new Several Letter of Credit shall be amended to decrease the amount thereof, or the Company shall arrange for such new Letter of Credit to be surrendered by such beneficiary to such Several L/C Agent, in order to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's L/C Tranche Commitment; and (C) such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage with respect to each applicable Tranche, whereupon such Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender.
          SECTION 2.19. . (a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section, the Company may, at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date upon not less than 10 Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period which is acceptable to the Administrative Agent), designate a wholly-owned, direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary of the Company to become a party to this Agreement as a Subsidiary Borrower; that each such designation shall be subject to the prior approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Upon receipt of such notice under this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Upon such approval and the satisfaction of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this Section, such Subsidiary shall become a party to this Agreement as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder and shall be entitled to borrow Loans on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of the effectiveness of such designation. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section, if the designation of such Subsidiary Borrower obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable Laws and regulations.

          (b) . The designation by the Company of any Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which the Administrative Agent shall have received each of the following documents (each of which shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in form and substance): (i) a Subsidiary Borrower Designation, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary, delivered to the Administrative Agent at least 5 Business Days before the date on which such Subsidiary is proposed to become a Subsidiary Borrower; (ii) a favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and appropriately dated) of external or internal counsel to such Subsidiary satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (and the Company and such Subsidiary Borrower hereby, and by delivery of such Subsidiary Borrower Designation, instruct such counsel to deliver such opinion to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders), as to such matters as are consistent with the scope of the opinion of counsel to the Company delivered
Conditions Precedent to Designation
 
pursuant to Section 4.01(e) and/or such other matters as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request; and (iii) such documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection therewith (including certified copies of the Organization Documents of such Subsidiary and of resolutions of its board of directors or similar governing body authorizing such Subsidiary becoming a Borrower hereunder, and of all documents evidencing all other necessary corporate or other action required with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower becoming party to this Agreement).
          (c) . So long as there shall be no Loans outstanding to a Subsidiary Borrower or other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by such Subsidiary Borrower (or any pending Borrowing Request by such Subsidiary Borrower), the Company may elect to terminate such Subsidiary Borrower as a Borrower hereunder by delivering to the Administrative Agent a notice substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 or any other form approved by the Administrative Agent (each a ""), duly completed and executed. Any Subsidiary Borrower Termination Notice furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly so notify the Lenders), whereupon all commitments of the Lenders to make Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower and the rights of such Subsidiary Borrower to borrow hereunder shall terminate and such Subsidiary Borrower shall immediately cease to be a Borrower hereunder and a party hereto; that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the delivery of a Subsidiary Borrower Termination Notice with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower shall not terminate or discharge (i) any obligation of such Subsidiary Borrower that remains unpaid at such time or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Article X with respect to any such unpaid obligations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the occurrence of any event described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VII with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower, or if at any time any Subsidiary Borrower shall cease to be a wholly-owned, direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary of the Company, (i) all commitments of the Lenders to make Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower and the rights of such Subsidiary Borrower to borrow hereunder shall automatically terminate and such Subsidiary Borrower shall immediately cease to be a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder and a party hereto and (ii) the principal amount then outstanding of, and the accrued interest on, the Loans (if any) made to such Subsidiary Borrower and all other amounts payable by such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder (including any amounts payable under Section 2.13) and under the other Loan Documents shall automatically become immediately due and payable, in each case, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by such Subsidiary Borrower and the Company.

Letters of Credit
Letter of Credit Commitment
          (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period, each L/C Tranche Lender agrees, through the applicable Several L/C Agent, (1) to issue severally, and for itself alone, Several Letters of Credit at the request of and for the account of the Company in such L/C Tranche Lender's L/C Tranche Applicable Percentage of the aggregate stated amounts of such Several Letters of Credit, and to amend or extend Several Letters of Credit previously issued by it, and (2) to honor severally, and for itself alone, drawings under the Several Letters of Credit in an amount equal to its L/C Tranche Applicable Percentage of such drawings; that after giving effect to any
provided
 
issuance, amendment or extension, (x) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations shall not exceed the total L/C Tranche Commitments, and (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations owing to such L/C Tranche Lender (whether as an issuer or as a participant) shall not exceed such L/C Tranche Lender's L/C Tranche Commitment (except as provided in Section 2.20(k) for a Limited Fronting Lender). Each request by the Company for the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Company that such issuance, amendment or extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Company may, during the Availability Period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.
          Each Several Letter of Credit shall be a standby letter of credit in such form as the Company shall request and which the Administrative Agent and the applicable Several L/C Agent shall determine in good faith does not contain any obligations, or diminish any rights, of any L/C Tranche Lender with respect thereto or other terms thereof that are inconsistent with the terms hereof. Without the prior consent of each L/C Tranche Lender, no Several Letter of Credit may be issued that would vary the several and not joint nature of the obligations of the L/C Tranche Lenders thereunder, and (subject to the provisions contained herein regarding Limited Fronting Lenders and Defaulting Lenders) each Several Letter of Credit shall be issued (through the applicable Several L/C Agent) by all of the L/C Tranche Lenders having L/C Tranche Commitments at the time of issuance as a single multi-bank letter of credit, but the obligation of each L/C Tranche Lender thereunder shall be several and not joint based upon its L/C Tranche Applicable Percentage of the aggregate undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit.
          If requested by the Company but subject to the terms and conditions hereof, a Letter of Credit shall satisfy the requirements for letters of credit under the credit-for-reinsurance provisions of the insurance Laws applicable to the relevant beneficiary (or the requirements for similar purposes of such other Governmental Authority which then regulates the relevant beneficiary's insurance business as may be specified by the Company) as to which the Company provides written notice to the applicable Several L/C Agent and the Administrative Agent prior to the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit; that the Several L/C Agent, the Administrative Agent or any L/C Tranche Lender shall not be obligated to verify such satisfaction.
provided
          All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto by the applicable Several L/C Agent (on behalf of the L/C Tranche Lenders) and shall be amended as provided herein as of the Closing Date, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.
          (ii) Neither the applicable Several L/C Agent nor the L/C Tranche Lenders (including for avoidance of doubt Limited Fronting Lenders), as applicable, shall issue any Letter of Credit, if:
     (A) subject to Section 2.20(b)(v), the expiry date of such Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Lenders under the L/C Tranche have approved such expiry date; or
 
     (B) the expiry date of such Letter of Credit would occur after the first anniversary of the Commitment Termination Date, unless all the L/C Tranche Lenders have approved such expiry date;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lenders or such other Recipient of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
          (c) . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and
Certificates from Lenders
 
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.13. . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.08(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an Affiliate of such Lender) for Dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and (if such Borrower is not the Company) the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
Break Funding Payments
          SECTION 2.14. .
Taxes
          (a) . Each payment by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any Law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
 
amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
          (b) . Each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.
Payment of Other Taxes by Loan Parties
          (c) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Evidence of Payments
          (d) . The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with any Loan Document (including amounts payable under this Section 2.14(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.14(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any Lender making a claim under this Section 2.14(d) on behalf of any of its beneficial owners, an indemnity payment under this Section 2.14(d) shall be due only to the extent that such Lender is able to establish that, with respect to the applicable Indemnified Taxes, such beneficial owners supplied to the applicable Persons such properly completed and executed documentation necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, such Indemnified Taxes.
Indemnification by Loan Parties
          (e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) and the Loan Parties for any Excluded Taxes, in each case attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Loan Party (as applicable) in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Excluded Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.14(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent or the applicable Loan Party (as applicable) delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes or Excluded Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Loan Party (as applicable). Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
Indemnification by Lenders
          (f) . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time such Lender
Status of Lenders
 
becomes a Lender hereunder or at times prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding, unless a Change in Law prevents such Lender from legally being able to complete, execute or deliver such form. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.14(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
          (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any Loan Party is a U.S. Person, any Lender with respect to such Loan Party shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by such Loan Party and the Administrative Agent), on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:
          (A) in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
          (B) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (1) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (2) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
          (C) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under the Loan Documents constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender's conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;
          (D) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) IRS Form W-8BEN and (2) a certificate substantially in the applicable form attached as part of Exhibit D (a "") to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Company within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code (c) a "controlled

foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (d) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected;
          (E) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under this Agreement (including a partnership or a participating Lender) (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this paragraph (f)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender; , , that if such Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; or
provided
however
          (F) any other form prescribed by Law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the applicable Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by Law to be withheld.
          (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.14(f)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
          (g) . If any Lender or the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that it has received a refund, in cash or applied as an offset against other cash tax liability, of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section), such indemnified party shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnifying party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any interest imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.14(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this
Treatment of Certain Refunds
 
Section 2.14(g) to the extent such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.14(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
          SECTION 2.15. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
          (a) . Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or fees, or under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
Payments by Borrowers
          (b) . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
Application of Insufficient Payments
          (c) . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
provided
 
this paragraph shall apply). Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
          (d) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
Presumptions of Payment
          (e) . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), 2.15(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent
          SECTION 2.16. .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (a) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.12 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of a Different Lending Office
          (b) . If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.12, (ii) any Loan Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
Replacement of Lenders
 
without recourse, all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (A) such assignment shall be effected in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 and such assignee (if not a Lender) shall have been approved by the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), (B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), (C) with respect to an assignment as a result of clause (iii) above, the assignment fee shall be paid to the Administrative Agent by the Company and (D) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
          SECTION 2.17. . The Company may, at any time after the Closing Date by notice to the Administrative Agent, propose an increase in the total Commitments hereunder (each such proposed increase being a "") either by having a Lender increase its Commitment then in effect (each an "") or by having a Person which is not then a Lender become a party hereto as a Lender with a new Commitment hereunder (each an ""), in each case, with the approval of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld). Such notice shall specify (i) the name of each Increasing Lender and/or Assuming Lender, as applicable, (ii) the amount of the Commitment Increase and the portion thereof being committed to by each such Increasing Lender or Assuming Lender and (iii) the date on which such Commitment Increase is to be effective (a "") (which shall be a Business Day at least five Business Days after delivery of such notice and 30 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date).

          Each Commitment Increase shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
     (i) unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, the Commitment of any Assuming Lender as part of any Commitment Increase shall be in a minimum amount of at least $25,000,000;
     (ii) unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, each Commitment Increase shall be in an amount of at least $25,000,000;
     (iii) immediately after giving effect to any Commitment Increase, the total Commitments hereunder shall not exceed $2,000,000,000;
     (iv) no Default has occurred and is continuing on the relevant Commitment Increase Date or shall result from any Commitment Increase; and
 
     (v) the representations and warranties of the Loan Parties set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of such representations and warranties qualified as to materiality, in all respects) on and as of the relevant Commitment Increase Date as if made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date).
          Each Commitment Increase (and the increase of the Commitment of each Increasing Lender and/or the new Commitment of each Assuming Lender, as applicable, resulting therefrom) shall become effective as of the relevant Commitment Increase Date upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, on or prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Commitment Increase Date, of (a) a certificate of a Responsible Officer stating that the conditions with respect to such Commitment Increase under this Section have been satisfied and (b) an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which, effective as of such Commitment Increase Date, each such Increasing Lender and/or such Assuming Lender, as applicable, shall provide its Commitment (or an increase of its Commitment, as applicable), duly executed by each such Lender and the Borrowers and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent. Upon the Administrative Agent's receipt of a fully executed agreement from each such Increasing Lender and/or Assuming Lender, together with such certificate of such Responsible Officer, the Administrative Agent shall record the information contained in such agreement in the Register and give prompt notice of the relevant Commitment Increase to the Company and the Lenders (including, if applicable, each Assuming Lender). On each Commitment Increase Date, if there are Loans then outstanding, each applicable Borrower shall simultaneously (i) prepay in full the outstanding Loans made to such Borrower immediately prior to giving effect to the relevant Commitment Increase in accordance with Section 2.08 and (ii) at such Borrower's option in accordance with this Agreement, such Borrower may request to borrow new Loans from all the Lenders (including, if applicable, any Assuming Lender) such that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans are held ratably by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (after giving effect to such Commitment Increase).
          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to agree to increase its Commitment hereunder and any election to do so shall be in the sole discretion of such Lender.
          SECTION 2.18. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
Defaulting Lenders
          (a) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to Section 2.09(a) for any period during which it is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that would otherwise have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender); and
          (b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other
 
modification pursuant to Section 9.02), except that (i) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (ii) any waiver, amendment or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.
          In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Company each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans then outstanding of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, whereupon such Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender.
          SECTION 2.19. . (a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section, the Company may, at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date upon not less than 10 Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period which is acceptable to the Administrative Agent), designate a wholly-owned, direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary of the Company to become a party to this Agreement as a Subsidiary Borrower; that each such designation shall be subject to the prior approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Upon receipt of such notice under this Section, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Upon such approval and the satisfaction of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this Section, such Subsidiary shall become a party to this Agreement as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder and shall be entitled to borrow Loans on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of the effectiveness of such designation. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section, if the designation of such Subsidiary Borrower obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable Laws and regulations.
Designation of Subsidiary Borrowers
Designation of Subsidiary Borrowers
provided
          (b) . The designation by the Company of any Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which the Administrative Agent shall have received each of the following documents (each of which shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent in form and substance): (i) a Subsidiary Borrower Designation, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary, delivered to the Administrative Agent at least 5 Business Days before the date on which such Subsidiary is proposed to become a Subsidiary Borrower; (ii) a favorable written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and appropriately dated) of external or internal counsel to such Subsidiary satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (and the Company and such Subsidiary Borrower hereby, and by delivery of such Subsidiary Borrower Designation, instruct such counsel to deliver such opinion to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders), as to
Conditions Precedent to Designation
 
such matters as are consistent with the scope of the opinion of counsel to the Company delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(e) and/or such other matters as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request; and (iii) such documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection therewith (including certified copies of the Organization Documents of such Subsidiary and of resolutions of its board of directors or similar governing body authorizing such Subsidiary becoming a Borrower hereunder, and of all documents evidencing all other necessary corporate or other action required with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower becoming party to this Agreement).
          (c) .
