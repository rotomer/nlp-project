ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
    American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K (Form 8-K) to update AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on February 27, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively (collectively, the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K), for the following changes:
Changes in Accounting for Acquisition Costs
    On January 1, 2012, AIG retrospectively adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The standard clarifies how to determine whether the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred policy acquisition costs. The effects on AIG shareholders' equity, Net income (loss) attributable to AIG and Net income (loss) per common share attributable to AIG common shareholders are summarized below:
 
    For short-duration insurance contracts, starting on January 1, 2012, AIG has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable. AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy, as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG

Table of Contents
historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.
Presentation of Comprehensive Income
    On January 1, 2012, AIG adopted an accounting standard that requires the presentation of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components, followed consecutively by a second statement that presents total other comprehensive income and its components. The adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the inclusion of condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income (loss) in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and condensed statements of comprehensive income of the Registrant included in Schedule II. The standard did not have any effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Chartis Segment Changes
    The historical Chartis financial information has been revised to reflect the reclassification in 2012 of certain Chartis products that were previously reported in the Commercial Insurance operating segment to the Consumer Insurance operating segment. These revisions did not affect the total Chartis reportable segment results previously reported or on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

8            AIG Form 8-K
    Items affecting comparability among periods include:
 - 
AIG was significantly and adversely affected by the market turmoil in late 2008 and early 2009 and recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2008 primarily related to collateralized mortgage-backed securities, other structured securities and securities of financial institutions; losses related to the change in AIG's intent and ability to hold to recovery certain securities; and losses related to AIG's securities lending program.
 - 
In 2008, AIG also recognized unrealized market valuation losses representing the change in fair value of its super senior credit default swap portfolio, established a deferred tax valuation allowance and experienced an unprecedented strain on liquidity. This strain led to several transactions and relationships with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) and the United States Department of the Treasury. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these transactions and relationships.
 - 
The decline in interest expense in 2010 was primarily due to a reduced weighted average interest rate on borrowings, a lower average outstanding balance and a decline in amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset related to the partial repayment of the credit facility provided by the FRBNY. On January 14, 2011, AIG repaid the remaining $20.7 billion and terminated this facility, resulting in a net $3.3 billion pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2011, primarily representing the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset included in Net loss on extinguishment of debt. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Recapitalization.
AIG Form 8-K            9
 - 
AIG executed multiple asset dispositions in 2011 and 2010, as further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which included the completion of an initial public offering of AIA in 2010 for which AIG recognized an $18.1 billion gain.
 - 
As further discussed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG concluded that $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released through the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2011.
 - 
As a result of the closing of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011, the preferred interests in the special purpose vehicles that held the proceeds of the AIA initial public offering (the AIA SPV Preferred Interests) and the American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) sale (the ALICO SPV Preferred Interests, and together with the AIA SPV Preferred Interests, the SPV Preferred Interests) held by the United States Department of the Treasury are not considered permanent equity on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
REVISIONS
    The information contained herein revises selected sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) as previously presented in Item 7 of Part II of AIG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 on Form 10-K/A filed on February 27, 2012 and March 30, 2012, respectively (collectively, the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K). As more fully described in Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, sections of the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K are being revised to reflect the following:
Changes in Accounting for Acquisition Costs
    On January 1, 2012, AIG retrospectively adopted a standard that changed its method of accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The standard clarifies how to determine whether the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred policy acquisition costs.
The effects on AIG shareholders' equity and Net income (loss) attributable to AIG is summarized below:
 
    For short-duration insurance contracts, starting in 2012, AIG has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable. AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy, as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.
Chartis Segment Changes

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
    This Current Report on Form 8-K and other publicly available documents may include, and AIG's officers and representatives may from time to time make, projections, goals, assumptions and statements that may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only AIG's belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside AIG's control. These projections, goals, assumptions and statements include statements preceded by, followed by or including words such as "believe", "anticipate", "expect", "intend", "plan", "view", "target" or "estimate". These projections, goals, assumptions and statements may address, among other things:
 - 
the timing of the disposition of the ownership position of the United States Department of the Treasury (Department of the Treasury) in AIG;
 - 
the timing and method of repayment of the preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC held by the Department of the Treasury;
 - 
the fair value of AIA and cash flow projections for AIG's Maiden Lane Interests;
 - 
the monetization of AIG's interests in International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC);
 - 
AIG's exposures to subprime mortgages, monoline insurers, the residential and commercial real estate markets, state and municipal bond issuers and sovereign bond issuers;
 - 
AIG's exposure to European governments and European financial institutions;
 - 
AIG's strategy for risk management;
 - 
AIG's ability to retain and motivate its employees;
 - 
AIG's generation of deployable capital;
 - 
AIG's return on equity and earnings per share long-term aspirational goals;
 - 
AIG's strategy to grow net investment income, efficiently manage capital and reduce expenses;
12            AIG Form 8-K
 - 
AIG's strategy for customer retention, growth, product development, market position, financial results and reserves; and
 - 
the revenues and combined ratios of AIG's subsidiaries.
    It is possible that AIG's actual results and financial condition will differ, possibly materially, from the results and financial condition indicated in these projections, goals, assumptions and statements. Factors that could cause AIG's actual results to differ, possibly materially, from those in the specific projections, goals, assumptions and statements include:
 - 
actions by credit rating agencies;
 - 
changes in market conditions;
 - 
the occurrence of catastrophic events;
 - 
significant legal proceedings;
 - 
concentrations in AIG's investment portfolios, including its municipal bond portfolio;
 - 
judgments concerning casualty insurance underwriting and reserves;
 - 
judgments concerning the recognition of deferred tax assets;
 - 
judgments concerning deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) recoverability;
 - 
judgments concerning the recoverability of aircraft values in ILFC's fleet; and
 - 
such other factors as are discussed throughout this MD&A and in Item 1A. Risk Factors discussed in AIG's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
    AIG is not under any obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter any projections, goals, assumptions or other statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms AIG, the Company, we, us, and our mean AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries.
USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
    Throughout this MD&A, AIG presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful and representative of ongoing operations as well as most transparent. Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations.
    AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis using underwriting profit (loss). Operating income (loss), which is income (loss) before net realized capital gains (losses) and related deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and sales inducement asset (SIA) amortization, is utilized to report results for SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) operations. Management believes that these measures enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of these businesses and allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG's insurance competitors. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable measurement derived from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), pre-tax income, are included in Results of Operations.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
    
This executive overview of management's discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in AIG's securities. This Current Report on Form 8-K should be read in its entirety for a complete description of events, trends and uncertainties as well as the critical accounting estimates affecting AIG and its subsidiaries.
AIG Form 8-K            13
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
    As further discussed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG concluded that $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released through the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2011.
    AIG's loss from continuing operations before income taxes represented a $20.6 billion decrease compared to its 2010 income and reflected the following:
 - 
a $3.3 billion net loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the first quarter of 2011, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) Credit Facility) on January 14, 2011, partially offset by a $484 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the exchange of junior subordinated debt;
 - 
significant catastrophe losses for Chartis totaling $3.3 billion, including losses from Thailand floods in the fourth quarter of 2011, Hurricane Irene in the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011 and the Great Tohoku Earthquake & Tsunami (the Tohoku catastrophe) in the first quarter of 2011, compared to catastrophe losses of $1.1 billion in 2010;
 - 
losses for Aircraft Leasing of $1.7 billion due to impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft in both 2011 and 2010;
 - 
$604 million in unfavorable fair value adjustments on AIG's economic interest in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and equity interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) (together, the Maiden Lane Interests);
 - 
2010 included a gain of $19.6 billion on sales of divested businesses, primarily consisting of a gain of $18.1 billion from the completion of the initial public offering and listing of AIA Group Limited (AIA) ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on October 29, 2010, as well as a gain of $1.3 billion recognized in 2010 related to the sale of AIG's headquarters building in Tokyo in 2009 which gain had been deferred until the expiration of certain lease provisions; and
 - 
income in 2010 from divested businesses prior to their sale totaling $2.4 billion, primarily representing AIA.
    Partially offsetting these declines were;
 - 
a reduction in prior year adverse loss development in 2011 compared to 2010;
 - 
a decrease in interest expense of $4.1 billion primarily resulting from the January 2011 repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility;
 - 
an increase in the fair value of AIA ordinary shares; and
 - 
a reduction in realized capital losses in 2011 compared to 2010.
    In 2011, AIG recorded income from discontinued operations net of taxes of $2.5 billion, which included a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2011 on the sale of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison) compared to a net loss of $645 million in 2010, which included goodwill impairment charges of $4.6 billion associated with the sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), AIG Star and AIG Edison.
    See Results of Operations herein for additional discussion of our results.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
    In order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, AIG changed its segments in the third quarter of 2011. AIG now reports the results of its operations through three reportable segments: Chartis, SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica), and Aircraft Leasing. Through these reportable segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries. AIG's subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through an extensive property-casualty and life insurance and retirement services network. Aircraft Leasing includes commercial aircraft and equipment leasing. AIG's Other operations category consists of businesses and items not allocated to AIG's reportable segments.
14            AIG Form 8-K
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
    During 2011, AIG experienced significant favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios, the sale of certain life insurance businesses, emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and a return to sustainable operating profits within its primary operations. Notably:
 - 
AIG released approximately $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated income tax group. The fourth quarter effect was $19.5 billion, which included valuation allowance increases during the first nine months of 2011. See Critical Accounting Estimates  Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset and Note 22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information;
 - 
Chartis prior year adverse loss reserve development declined by $4.6 billion to $211 million;
 - 
Interest expense declined $4.1 billion, primarily due to the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility; and
 - 
Improving equity markets contributed to a $1.3 billion increase in the market valuation of AIG's holding of AIA ordinary shares.
    Offsetting these favorable developments were record catastrophe losses for Chartis and the effects of several macroeconomic drivers, including declining equity markets, widening credit spreads, and declining interest rates, including:
 - 
Total catastrophe losses of $3.3 billion for Chartis in 2011 compared to $1.1 billion in 2010;
 - 
Aircraft Leasing losses of $1.7 billion due to impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft;
 - 
The widening of credit spreads, reduced interest rates, and changes in the timing of estimated future cash flows drove declines of $604 million in the recorded fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests;
 - 
AIG recognized a $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt related to the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility, which was partially offset by a $484 million gain on extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange of junior subordinated debt; and
 - 
Components of operating results decreased due to the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010.
AIG Form 8-K            15
The following table presents AIG's consolidated results of operations (comparability with 2010 and 2009 is affected by the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010):
    The comparisons of 2011 and 2010 results to the respective prior year follow:
Premiums
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Premiums decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the deconsolidation in the fourth quarter of 2010 of AIA, which accounted for $9.3 billion of premiums in 2010. The decline in premiums for 2011 compared to 2010 was partially offset by an increase in Chartis premiums, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Premiums decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction of $3.3 billion related to 2009 dispositions that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting. These dispositions included HSB Group, Inc. (HSB), 21st Century Insurance Group (including Agency Auto Division and excluding Chartis
16            AIG Form 8-K
Private Client Group) (21st Century) and AIG Life of Canada (AIG Life Canada), as well as the deconsolidation of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc (Transatlantic) in 2009.
Policy Fees
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Policy fees decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 as higher variable annuity fee income was more than offset by lower surrender charges due to decreased surrender rates and universal life unlockings.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Policy fees increased slightly for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher variable annuity fees on separate account assets consistent with the growth in variable accounts assets as a result of favorable equity market conditions in late 2010.
Net Investment Income
The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net investment income:
*
Includes hedge funds, private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships.
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Net investment income decreased primarily due to the following:
 - 
the effect of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. AIA net investment income prior to deconsolidation in 2010 totaled $4.0 billion, which included $886 million in policyholder trading gains;
 - 
a decline in the fair value of the Maiden Lane Interests of $604 million due to significant widening of credit spreads and reduced interest rates compared to gains of $2.3 billion in 2010; and
 - 
fair value losses on the MetLife securities prior to their sale in March 2011.
AIG Form 8-K            17
    These decreases were partially offset by:
 - 
fair value gains on the AIA ordinary shares in 2011 compared to losses in 2010; and
 - 
an increase in income from fixed maturity securities, excluding the effect of the AIA deconsolidation, due to higher average invested asset balances as a result of the cash redeployment in 2011.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Net investment income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to significantly higher income from private equity funds and hedge fund investments due to an improved market environment compared to 2009, and increased valuation gains associated with the Maiden Lane Interests.
    These increases were partially offset by a decline in policyholder trading gains compared to 2009. Policyholder trading gains are offset by a change in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred and generally reflect the trends in equity markets, principally in Asia.
Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)
The following table summarizes the components of consolidated Net realized capital gains (losses):
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    AIG recognized net realized capital gains in 2011 compared to net realized capital losses in 2010 due to the following:
 - 
lower other-than-temporary impairment charges from issuer-specific credit events and changes in intent; and
 - 
improvement in the provision for loan losses due to an increase in collateral values as a result of improved operating performance and improved market conditions.
    These gains were partially offset by the following:
 - 
lower gains on sales of equity securities in 2011 compared to 2010 due to higher sales in 2010 resulting from the continuing insurance companies' portfolio repositioning;
 - 
fair value losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010 on the MetLife securities prior to their sale in March 2011;
 - 
foreign exchange transaction losses incurred in 2011 compared to gains in 2010, primarily from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British Pound; and
 - 
the deconsolidation of AIA.
18            AIG Form 8-K
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Net realized capital losses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the following:
 - 
increased gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities in 2010;
 - 
lower other-than-temporary impairment charges for fixed maturity securities in 2010 as a result of the adoption of the other-than-temporary impairments accounting standard commencing in the second quarter of 2009. See Investments - Impairments - Other-Than-Temporary Impairments in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
 - 
foreign exchange transaction gains incurred in 2010 compared to losses in 2009 primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British Pound compared to 2009.
    These improvements were partially offset by lower gains from derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, particularly those used to hedge foreign exchange movements.
Aircraft Leasing Revenue
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly, primarily due to a reduction in ILFC's average fleet size resulting from sales of aircraft and the impact of lower lease revenue earned on re-leased aircraft in its fleet. In 2011, ILFC had an average of 932 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 963 in 2010.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Aircraft leasing revenue decreased slightly due to a reduction in ILFC's average fleet size resulting from sales of aircraft and the impact of lower lease rates on used aircraft. In 2010, ILFC had an average of 963 aircraft in its fleet, compared to 974 in 2009.
Other Income
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    The decline in Other income for 2011 compared to 2010 was driven by:
 - 
a decline of $559 million in credit valuation adjustment gains on Direct Investment book non-derivative assets and liabilities;
 - 
a decline of $259 million in unrealized market valuation adjustment gains on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio;
 - 
a decline of $172 million in unrealized market valuation adjustments on the AIGFP credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits, due to losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010; and
 - 
a bargain purchase gain of $332 million recognized in the first quarter of 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji, which is further discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    These declines were partially offset by significantly lower levels of real estate investment impairment charges in 2011.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    The decline in Other income for 2010 compared to 2009 was driven by a decline of $1.0 billion and $975 million in credit valuation adjustments on Direct Investment book non-derivative assets and liabilities and AIGFP derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, as well as a decline of $820 million in unrealized market valuation adjustments on the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio. This decline was partially offset by a bargain
AIG Form 8-K            19
purchase gain of $332 million related to the Fuji acquisition and reduced losses from AIGFP from lower unwind costs.
Policyholder Benefits and Claims Incurred
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the following:
 - 
a decline of $8.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of AIA; and
 - 
Chartis' $72 million of net reserve strengthening in 2011 compared to net strengthening of $4.3 billion in 2010.
    This decline was partially offset by:
 - 
increased catastrophe losses throughout the year, including the Thailand floods in the fourth quarter of 2011, Hurricane Irene in the third quarter of 2011, the U.S. tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011, and the Tohoku Catastrophe in the first quarter of 2011;
 - 
the effect of Chartis' consolidation of Fuji;
 - 
increased claims and claims adjustment expenses for Mortgage Guaranty operations due to increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims; and
 - 
increased claims at SunAmerica due to enhanced death benefit reserving practices.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in 2010 primarily due to:
 - 
a reduction of $2.2 billion as a result of the dispositions in 2009 noted above that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations accounting;
 - 
a decrease in incurred policy losses and benefit expenses for AIA of $1.3 billion related to a decline in policyholder trading gains which are discussed above in Net Investment Income; and
 - 
a decrease in claims and claims adjustment expense of $2.4 billion for Mortgage Guaranty operations primarily due to lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, higher cure rates on existing first-lien and international delinquent loans and the recognition of stop loss limits on certain second-lien policies.
    Partially offsetting these declines were:
 - 
the net $4.3 billion of reserve strengthening in 2010 compared to reserve strengthening of $2.8 billion in 2009;
 - 
increased catastrophe losses for Chartis; and
 - 
the effect of the consolidation of Fuji in 2010.
    See Segments Results  Chartis Operations  Chartis Results herein for further discussion.
Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    The decrease in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2011 compared to 2010 resulted primarily from the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010. The AIA amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 totaled $814 million.
20            AIG Form 8-K
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    The decrease in Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily resulted from the dispositions of HSB, 21st Century, AIG Life Canada and Transatlantic in 2009 and from the decrease in amortization for SunAmerica related to improved equity market conditions.
Other Acquisition and Insurance Expenses
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Other acquisition and insurance expenses decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the deconsolidation of AIA in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by the consolidation of Fuji commencing in the third quarter of 2010. AIA other acquisition and insurance expenses in 2010 totaled $1.8 billion.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Other acquisition and insurance expenses increased in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of increased expenses at Chartis, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Fuji noted above, partially offset by a $1.0 billion decrease related to the dispositions in 2009 noted above.
Interest Expense
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Interest expense decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the repayment and termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility on January 14, 2011. Interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility was $72 million in 2011 through the date of termination compared to $4.1 billion in 2010, including amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of $48 million and $3.5 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility in connection with the Recapitalization in January 2011.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility reflecting a reduced weighted average interest rate on borrowings, a lower average outstanding balance and a decline in amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset as set forth below.
Aircraft Leasing Expenses
    ILFC recorded impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges of $1.7 billion in both 2011 and 2010 and charges of $51 million in 2009. See Segment Results - Aircraft Leasing Operations - Aircraft Leasing Results in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
AIG Form 8-K            21
Net Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
    The loss on extinguishment of debt for 2011 includes:
 - 
a $3.3 billion charge primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility, which is further discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and
 - 
a $484 million gain on extinguishment related to the junior subordinated debt exchange in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Net (Gain) Loss on Sale of Divested Businesses and Properties
    Net (gain) loss on sale of divested businesses and properties includes the net (gain) loss on the sale of divested businesses that did not qualify as discontinued operations as well as gains and losses from property disposals in connection with AIG's restructuring program.
    The gain in 2010 primarily represents a gain of $18.1 billion on the sale of 67 percent of AIA, a gain of $228 million associated with the termination fee paid by Prudential plc to AIG related to the termination of the agreement to purchase AIA and a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of the Otemachi building in Japan. See Segment Results  Chartis Operations  Chartis Results  Chartis Investing and Other Results herein for further information.
Other Expenses
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Other expenses decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to;
 - 
lower securities-related litigation charges; and
 - 
lower restructuring charges.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Other expenses decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to:
 - 
goodwill impairment charges of $612 million recorded in 2009 related to the Institutional Asset Management business;
 - 
lower compensation-related costs for the Institutional Asset Management business, including the effect of deconsolidation of certain portfolio investments and the sale of the Swiss bank; and
 - 
lower provisions for credit losses for consumer finance businesses not presented as discontinued operations.
Income Taxes
2011 Effective Tax Rate
    For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pretax loss from continuing operations was not meaningful, due to the significant effect of releasing approximately $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2011. Other less significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits of $454 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $386 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and $224 million associated with AIG's investment in subsidiaries and partnerships.
22            AIG Form 8-K
2010 Effective Tax Rate
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was 34.3 percent. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, attributable to continuing operations differed from the statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits of $1.3 billion associated with AIG's investment in subsidiaries and partnerships, principally the AIA SPV which is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, and $587 million associated with tax exempt interest, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations of $1.4 billion.
2009 Effective Tax Rate
    For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate on pre-tax loss from continuing operations was 14.2 percent. The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, differed from the statutory rate primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance of $3.0 billion and reserve for uncertain tax positions of $874 million, partially offset by tax exempt interest of $677 million and the change in investment in subsidiaries and partnerships of $473 million which was principally related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to sales of subsidiaries.
    See Critical Accounting Estimates - Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Discontinued Operations
Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations is comprised of the following:
    Significant items affecting the comparison of results from discontinued operations included the following:
 - 
a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion on the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison in 2011;
 - 
impairments of goodwill in 2010 of $4.6 billion related to ALICO, AIG Star and AIG Edison. See Note 2(j) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion;
 - 
a pre-tax gain of $7.9 billion on the sale of ALICO in 2010;
 - 
a pre-tax loss of approximately $1.7 billion on the sale of AGF in 2010;
 - 
a pre-tax loss of $605 million recognized in 2009 related to the sale of Nan Shan, as well as an additional loss on sale of $830 million recognized in 2010; and
 - 
tax effects of the above transactions, notably the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment and the change in investment in subsidiaries, which was principally related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the planned sales.
    See Notes 4 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations.
AIG Form 8-K            23
SEGMENT RESULTS
    AIG presents and discusses its financial information in the following manner, which it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of its segments as follows:
 - 
Chartis  underwriting profit (loss), which is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses, and is before net investment income, net realized capital gains (losses), bargain purchase gain and other income (expense)  net;
 - 
SunAmerica and Aircraft Leasing  Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization; and
 - 
Results from discontinued operations and net gains (losses) on sales of divested businesses are excluded from these measures.
    AIG believes that these measures allow for a better assessment and enhanced understanding of the operating performance of each business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of its businesses. When such measures are disclosed, reconciliations to GAAP pre-tax income are provided.
As described in Revisions above, on January 1, 2012, AIG adopted, on a retrospective basis, an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the following table shows the increase (decrease) to each segment's pre-tax income (loss) from the adoption of this standard:
*
Includes an adjustment to the gain on the sale of AIA ordinary shares in 2010 as a result of the lower net asset value at time of disposition from the retrospective adoption of the acquisition cost standard.
    In order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, AIG changed its segments in the third quarter of 2011. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on AIG's segment changes.
    Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for the above items. Additionally, certain other reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current period presentation.
24            AIG Form 8-K
The following table summarizes the operations of each reportable segment. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Chartis Operations
    Chartis is a leading property-casualty and general insurance organization with over 44,000 employees serving more than 70 million clients around the world. During 2011, Chartis completed a reorganization of its operations and now presents its financial information in two operating segments  Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance  as well as a Chartis Other operations category. Previously, Chartis presented its financial information under Chartis U.S. and Chartis International. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
    As previously noted, AIG presents and discusses its financial information in a manner it believes is most meaningful to its financial statement users. AIG analyzes the operating performance of Chartis using underwriting profit (loss) and pre-tax income (loss). Underwriting profit (loss) is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred and underwriting expenses. Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies for short duration contracts. The unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally recognized in earnings ratably over the policy period. Net premiums written for long duration contracts are earned when due from the policyholder. Net premiums written reflect the premiums retained after purchasing reinsurance protection.
    Chartis, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is underwriting expenses, which consist of acquisition costs plus other insurance expenses, divided by net premiums earned. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of claims and claims adjustment expenses, and other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.
    The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and associated ratios.
AIG Form 8-K            25
    Chartis will continue to assess the performance of its operating segments based in part on underwriting profit, loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. Chartis believes these metrics provide long-term measures of the performance of the business compared to historical results and peer companies. In addition, Chartis is developing new value based metrics that provide management shorter-term measures to evaluate its performance across multiple lines and various countries. As an example, Chartis has implemented a risk-adjusted profitability model as a business performance measure, which it will continue to refine. Along with underwriting results, this risk-adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations, costs of capital and net investment income. Chartis believes that such performance measures will allow it to manage changes in its business mix.
    Investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. The model estimates investable funds based upon the loss reserves, unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment. The investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk-free yields (plus an illiquidity premium) consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities. The actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments are assigned to Chartis Other.
    For the year ended December 31, 2011, results reflect the effects of the full year of Fuji operations, while the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of Fuji for only two quarters; because Chartis began consolidating Fuji's operating results on July 1, 2010. Fuji operations primarily relate to Consumer Insurance.
    The historical Chartis financial information has been revised to reflect the reclassification of certain products that were previously reported in the Commercial Insurance operating segment to the Consumer Insurance operating segment. These changes align financial reporting to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the Chartis segment to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. These revisions did not impact the total Chartis reportable segment results previously reported.
Chartis Results
The following table presents Chartis results:
*
Includes gain on divested properties of $669 million in 2010.
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Chartis recognized pre-tax income in 2011 compared to a pre-tax loss in 2010 primarily due to the decrease in the loss ratio, partially offset by the effect of increased catastrophe losses in 2011, detailed as follows:
 - 
Net prior year adverse loss development, net of premiums and loss-sensitive premium adjustments, decreased from $4.3 billion in 2010 to $72 million in 2011.
26            AIG Form 8-K
 - 
The combined ratio declined to 108.8 in 2011 from 116.8 in 2010. Catastrophe losses were $3.3 billion in 2011 compared to $1.1 billion in 2010. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 99.6 in 2011, compared to 113.5 in 2010, a 13.9 point improvement.
 - 
Net realized capital gains on sales of fixed maturity securities increased in connection with Chartis' strategy to better align investment allocations with current overall performance and income tax planning objectives.
    Also, Chartis realized an increase in net premiums written primarily related to the acquisition of Fuji, which Chartis began consolidating on July 1, 2010, and in the Commercial Insurance property lines, which experienced improved pricing and modifications to its reinsurance program.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Chartis reported a pre-tax loss in 2010 compared to pre-tax income in 2009 primarily due to the increase in the net prior year adverse loss development, net of premiums and loss-sensitive premium adjustments, from $2.8 billion in 2009 to $4.3 billion in 2010. In addition, catastrophe losses increased by $1.0 billion. These were partially offset by an increase in net premiums written, primarily related to the Fuji acquisition, as well as improved market conditions and the impact of gains in 2010 related to the acquisition of Fuji and the sale of the Otemachi Building.
Chartis Net Premiums Written
    Net premiums written are the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. From the period in which the premiums are written until the period in which they are recognized, the amount is part of the unearned premium reserve.
The following table presents Chartis net premiums written by major line of business:
AIG Form 8-K            27
The following table presents the effect of the acquisition of Fuji on Chartis net premiums written:
*
For the year ended December 31, 2011, results reflect the effects of the full year of Fuji operations, while the corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of Fuji for only two quarters, because Chartis began consolidating Fuji's operating results on July 1, 2010.
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Chartis' net premiums written increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the Fuji acquisition, the improvement in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Japanese Yen, and further growth in the strategic higher value lines of business. These increases were partially offset by the decline in Commercial Casualty business in 2011 and more specifically the effects of risk management initiatives in workers' compensation and certain other lines of business in Chartis. They also reflect Chartis' continued commitment to maintain price discipline in lines where market rates are unsatisfactory. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, Chartis' net premiums written increased in 2011 by 3.4 percent compared to 2010.
    The year ended December 31, 2011 reflects net premiums written related to Fuji of $4.0 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2010. The year ended December 31, 2011 also reflects the effects of overall improvements in ratable exposures (i.e., asset values, payrolls and sales), general pricing improvement and retrospective premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts.
    Chartis has continued a strategy that started in 2010 to improve the allocation of its reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. As part of this strategy, Chartis has secured $1.45 billion in protection for U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes through three separate catastrophe bond transactions. In 2011, Chartis secured $575 million in a bond transaction and in 2010, $875 million through two separate bond transactions. These bond transactions in 2011 and 2010 reduced net premiums written by approximately $201 million and $208 million, respectively.
    Growing higher value Consumer business continues to be a key strategy. Total Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased 21 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange and the Fuji acquisition, Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased by less than one percent.
    In 2011, management implemented certain initiatives designed to provide for a more effective use of capital, including:
 - 
restructuring the renewals of certain Commercial Casualty loss-sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure; and
 - 
the decision to cease writing excess workers' compensation business as a stand-alone product.
28            AIG Form 8-K
    The effect of these actions decreased premiums in 2011 by approximately $0.6 billion. However, given the capital intensive nature of these classes of casualty business, Chartis expects that over time, these actions will improve its results.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Chartis' net premiums written increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to the Fuji acquisition and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth in higher value lines of business. Excluding the effects of the Fuji transaction, Chartis' net premiums written decreased in 2010 by 2.6 percent compared to 2009. This decrease is primarily due to declines in Commercial businesses in the U.S. and other developed markets, as well as the effects of risk management initiatives in the U.S. and Canada region designed to reduce catastrophe-exposed business in property and overall exposure in Chartis' long-tail casualty lines. The decrease also reflects Chartis' commitment to maintain price discipline in lines where market rates are unsatisfactory, as well as overall rate declines and a decline in ratable exposures such as workers' compensation.
    Further, during 2010, Chartis entered into two separate three-year reinsurance transactions, secured through the issuance of catastrophe bonds, which provide protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes, and reduced 2010 net premiums written by approximately $208 million.
AIG transacts business in most major foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on Chartis net premiums written:
*
Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.
Chartis Underwriting Ratios
The following table summarizes the Chartis combined ratios based on GAAP data and the impact of catastrophe losses, prior year development and related reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments on loss-sensitive contracts on the Chartis consolidated loss and combined ratios:
AIG Form 8-K            29
Loss Ratios
The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Chartis:
    The decrease in the loss ratio for 2011 compared to 2010 reflects the substantial decrease in the net prior year loss development, net of premiums and loss-sensitive premium adjustments in 2011 as shown in the table above and to a lesser extent the improvement in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in the loss ratio was partially offset by the effect of increased catastrophe losses in 2011 compared to 2010.
    This decrease in the adjusted 2011 loss ratio was partially due to the effect of the Fuji acquisition offset by an increase in the 2011 accident year loss ratio for the Specialty Workers' Compensation and Excess Casualty business (within the U.S. and Canada region) and the Primary Casualty and Professional Indemnity businesses (within the Europe region).
    The 2011 net adverse loss development charge of $72 million, primarily relates to the primary casualty, workers' compensation, and environmental business lines, partially offset by the net favorable loss development in the financial lines and excess casualty lines.
    The loss ratio for Chartis increased in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily as a result of the net adverse loss development for prior accident years recorded in 2010.
    Approximately 80 percent of the 2010 net prior year adverse loss development charge of $4.3 billion relates to the asbestos, excess casualty, excess workers' compensation, and primary workers' compensation lines. Further, 83 percent of this charge relates to accident years 2007 and prior (accident years before the financial crisis in 2008) and 65 percent relates to accident years 2005 and prior (accident years prior to the start of the managed reduction in these long-tail lines of business).
    Most of the 2009 net adverse loss development charge of $2.8 billion relates to excess casualty, excess workers' compensation and the asbestos lines of business. Further, approximately 95 percent relates to accident years 2005 and prior.
    Writings in long-tail lines of business that were the drivers of the reserve charges in 2010 and 2009 have been reduced since 2006. In the case of asbestos, since 1985, standard policies have contained an absolute exclusion for asbestos and pollution-related damages.
30            AIG Form 8-K
The following table presents Chartis catastrophe losses by major event:
(a)
Events shown in the above table are catastrophic events, for which the net impact to Chartis is in excess of $200 million each. All other events include 13 events in 2010 and 14 events in 2011 that are considered catastrophic but the net impact of which remains below the $200 million itemization threshold. Catastrophe losses for 2009 are not presented above as there was one significant catastrophe event, flooding in the Southwestern United States, totaling $53 million for Commercial Insurance.
(b)
On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake occurred near the northeast coast of Honshu, Japan, triggering a tsunami in the Pacific Ocean. This disaster is referred to as the Tohoku Catastrophe.
Expense Ratios
    The expense ratio decreased in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to the effect of including Fuji results for a full year and the effects of foreign exchange. These decreases were partially offset by Chartis' increased investments in a number of strategic initiatives during 2011, including the implementation of improved regional governance and risk management capabilities, the implementation of global accounting and claims systems, preparation for Solvency II and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives.
    The expense ratio increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to Chartis' strategy to continue the enhancement and build-out of its financial systems. In addition, during 2010 Chartis recorded increased expenses relating to long-term incentive programs that will continue to align employee performance incentive programs with profitability, capital management, risk management, and other performance measures. Further, increased acquisition expenses reflect increased regulatory assessments, more specifically in the workers' compensation lines, and new marketing agreements with select strategic distribution partners. These increases were partially offset by an overall decline in the expense ratio relating to the acquisition of Fuji.
Chartis Investing and Other Results
    Chartis manages and accounts for its invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements. Within a legal entity, invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance operating segments as well as Chartis Other. Invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the Commercial and Consumer Insurance operating segments.
    As discussed earlier, investment income is allocated to the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance segments based on an internal investment income allocation model. See Segment Results  Chartis Operations for more information.
AIG Form 8-K            31
The following table presents Chartis investing and other results:
*
Includes gain on divested properties of $669 million in 2010.
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Net investment income:
    Overall in 2011, net investment income decreased slightly due to declines in private equity and hedge fund income as well as increases in investment expenses. These decreases were largely offset by increases in interest income. The decrease in private equity and hedge fund income reflects the decline in the overall equity markets during the second half of 2011. The increase in investment expenses in 2011 resulted mainly from increases in both internal and external investment management fees. The interest income increase relates to the redeployment of cash and short term instruments into longer term, higher yield securities. In addition, 2011 reflects a full year of interest income related to Fuji, which has been consolidated by Chartis since July 1, 2010.
    Net realized capital gains (losses):
    Increases are due to gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities in connection with the strategy discussed above to better align Chartis' investment allocations with current overall performance and income tax objectives; a decrease in other-than-temporary impairment charges; gains from improvements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar; and gains from derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, resulting primarily from declining long term interest rates. These derivative instruments economically hedge products that provide benefits over an extended period of time.
    These gains were partially offset by impairments recognized within other invested assets, primarily life settlement contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, impairment charges of $351 million and $78 million, respectively, were recorded by Chartis related to life settlement contracts, including approximately $38 million and $4 million of impairments, respectively, associated with life insurance policies issued by SunAmerica life insurance companies that are eliminated in consolidation. Life settlement contracts are evaluated for impairment on a contract-by-contract basis. A contract is identified as potentially impaired if its undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the current carrying value of such contract. Life settlement contracts are impaired, and written down to fair value, when the carrying value of the contract is greater than the estimated fair value.
    During 2011, Chartis began receiving updated medical information for its life settlement contracts as a result of an enhanced process in which information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individual's health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts, resulting in an increase in the number of contracts identified as potentially impaired when compared to previous analyses. Further, the domestic operations of Chartis refined their fair values based upon the availability of recent medical information.
    Bargain purchase gain:
    On March 31, 2010, Chartis purchased additional voting shares in Fuji which resulted in the effective control and consolidation of Fuji. This acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $0.3 billion, which was included in the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss) in Other Income. The bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of Fuji's common stock, which Chartis believes was the result of macro-economic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fuji's financial condition and results of operations. Chartis anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to U.S. or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the Fuji shares.

    Other income (expense)  net:
    In May 2009, AIG completed the legal sale of its interest in the Otemachi Building in Japan, including the land and development rights. The transaction initially did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes at that time, due to AIG's continued involvement with the property, which did not end until December 2010. As a result, AIG recognized a gain of approximately $1.3 billion in pre-tax income, of which $669 million was included in the Chartis results in 2010.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Net investment income:
    The increase in 2010 was primarily the result of an increase in the value of partnership investments as market conditions improved in 2010, while 2009 included losses from an equity method investment.
    Net realized capital losses:
    Net realized capital losses for Chartis declined in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities and lower other-than-temporary impairment charges as market conditions continued to improve.
    Bargain purchase gain:
    During 2010, Chartis recognized a bargain purchase gain of $332 million in connection with the acquisition of Fuji.
    Other income (expense)  net:
    Represents the Chartis portion of the gain on the sale of AIG's Otemachi Building in Japan.

Computed using a constant exchange rate for each period.
AIG Form 8-K            33
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Commercial Insurance net premiums written increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to:
 - 
increases in Property lines driven by positive pricing trends and reinsurance modifications resulting in increased retentions; the rate environment for Property has been particularly strong for the U.S. and the Far East region;
 - 
an increase in additional premiums on Commercial Casualty's loss-sensitive business of $164 million compared to 2010. Loss-sensitive business relates to policies whose premiums vary with the level of underlying losses. Accordingly, in 2011, additional premiums of $172 million were recognized relating to additional prior year losses. The corresponding 2010 period reflects the effects of additional premiums of $8 million;
 - 
general improvements in rates, in particular for workers' compensation;
 - 
continued growth and market penetration across growth economy nations; and
 - 
improvements in foreign exchange currency rates.
    Offsetting these increases was an approximately $0.6 billion decrease in net premiums written relating to the change of certain policy forms at renewal from retrospectively rated premium structures to loss reimbursement deductible structures.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Commercial Insurance net premiums written decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to:
 - 
risk management initiatives resulting in the reduction of aggregate exposures in certain Commercial Casualty, Property and Specialty lines of business;
 - 
lower workers' compensation net premiums written due to declining rates, lower employment levels, increased competition and Chartis' continued strategy to maintain price discipline;
 - 
decreases in Financial lines due to declines in various classes of professional liability business, which were negatively affected to a greater extent than other classes by the credit crisis, and Chartis' decisions to reduce writings within environmental coverage and not to renew a credit card indemnification program that did not meet internal profitability targets;
 - 
decreases in Commercial Casualty due to a combination of declines in the construction, real estate and transportation classes and limited availability of capital for new projects, which impacted general liability and commercial umbrella business. These were offset by improved pricing, increased new business submissions and improved retention resulting from increased stabilization of developed economies after the financial crisis that began in 2008; and
 - 
effects of three-year reinsurance agreements, secured through catastrophe bonds, which provided protection from U.S. hurricanes and earthquakes, and reduced 2010 net premiums written by approximately $208 million.

The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Commercial Insurance:
Loss Ratios
    The loss ratio improved in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the effect of net prior year adverse loss development in 2010 and an increase in additional premiums from loss-sensitive business in 2011. These items were largely offset by the increase in catastrophe losses in 2011.
    The loss ratio increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the net prior year adverse loss development in 2010 for the excess casualty and workers' compensation lines of business.
    For a more detailed discussion of Net Prior Year Loss Development, see the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense section in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Expense Ratios
    The expense ratio improved in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates and overall growth in the business. In addition, the expense ratio reflects the effects of continued enhancements to regional governance, risk management capabilities and investments within growth economy nations.
    The expense ratio increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a change in the mix of business from low commission casualty business to higher commission property business. In addition, the increase in general operating expenses reflects Chartis' strategy to continue the enhancement and build-out of its financial systems. Further, during 2010, Chartis recorded increased expenses relating to long-term incentive programs that will continue to align employee performance incentive programs with profitability, capital management, risk management, and other performance measures

Consumer Insurance
Consumer Insurance Results
The following table presents Consumer Insurance results:
Consumer Insurance Net Premiums Written
2011 and 2010 comparison
    Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the effect of including Fuji results for a full year, the improvement in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese Yen, and further growth in the strategic higher value lines of business. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased 5 percent in 2011, primarily due to:
 - 
A&H net premiums written increased by approximately 10 percent. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, A&H net premiums written increased by approximately 7 percent primarily as a result of the execution of Chartis' growth strategies in key lines and the effect of foreign exchange. The Far East region continued to implement favorable marketing programs and benefited from rate increases implemented in 2010. Growth was also demonstrated in key geographic markets such as Asia Pacific, including China, EMEA, including Continental Europe, and Israel, and in targeted areas, such as direct marketing and travel insurance.
 - 
Personal Lines net premiums written increased by approximately 26 percent. Excluding the effects of the Fuji acquisition, Personal Lines net premiums increased by two percent, primarily as a result of Chartis' decisions to not renew certain programs in the U.S. and Canada region that did not meet performance targets. Personal Lines continued to grow in key markets, including Japan and Latin America and in key lines, such as specialized personal lines products.
 - 
Life net premiums written increased primarily as a result of the full year effect of the Fuji acquisition and as a result of the execution of new business strategies at Fuji Life Insurance Company Ltd.
2010 and 2009 comparison
    Consumer Insurance net premiums written increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of Fuji.

The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Consumer Insurance:
Loss Ratios
    The loss ratio increased in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses in 2011. During 2011, Consumer Insurance recorded net prior year adverse loss development of $84 million, primarily due to programs in the U.S. and Canada region that are not being renewed. This compares to net prior year favorable loss development of $71 million in 2010.
    The increase in the loss ratio in 2010 compared to 2009 reflects the effect of Fuji in 2010 and increased claims in Japan and Europe. In 2010, Consumer Insurance recorded favorable net prior year loss development of $71 million primarily due to favorable development in the Asia Pacific region. This compares to net prior year adverse loss development in 2009 of $80 million primarily due to reserve development in Japan and Latin America.
    For a more detailed discussion of Net Prior Year Loss Development, see the Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense section in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
AIG Form 8-K            37
Expense Ratios
    The expense ratio decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the effects of including Fuji results for a full year. Fuji has a lower average expense ratio than the rest of the Consumer Insurance business due in part to its business mix.
    The expense ratio decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the net benefit from Fuji net deferred acquisition costs, which were capitalized subsequent to the Fuji acquisition.

The following table presents the components of net prior year adverse development for Chartis Other:
Underwriting Results
    Substantially all of the net premiums written in the above table relate to excess workers' compensation. The excess workers' compensation line of business is subject to premium audits (upon the expiration of the underlying policy) and, as a result, Chartis Other will reflect the effects of premium audit activity through subsequent years.
    Given the run-off nature of the legacy lines of business and the nature of the expenses included in Chartis Other, management has determined that traditional underwriting measures of loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio do not provide an appropriate measure of underwriting performance. Therefore, underwriting ratios are not presented for Chartis Other.
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    For the year 2011 compared to 2010, the decrease in net premiums written and claims and claim adjustment expenses reflect the effects of the run-off activities associated with the excess workers' compensation business,

while the underwriting expenses increased as a result of certain expenses related to corporate initiatives and expense allocations of AIG Parent.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    For the year 2010 compared to 2009, the increase in claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred relates to net prior year adverse loss development in 2010.

SunAmerica Operations
    SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups including term life, universal life, A&H products, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. SunAmerica offers its products and services through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes banks, national, regional and independent broker-dealers, affiliated financial advisors, independent marketing organizations, independent and career insurance agents, structured settlement brokers, benefit consultants and direct to-consumer platforms.
    In managing SunAmerica, AIG analyzes the operating performance of each business using Operating income (loss), which is before net realized capital gains (losses) and related DAC and SIA amortization. Operating income (loss) is not a substitute for pre-tax income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, AIG believes that the presentation of Operating income (loss) enhances the understanding of the underlying profitability of the ongoing operations of SunAmerica. The reconciliations to pre-tax income are provided in the tables that follow.
SunAmerica Results
The following table presents SunAmerica results:
40            AIG Form 8-K
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    SunAmerica reported a decrease in operating income in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting lower net investment income, higher DAC amortization and higher policyholder benefit expense in SunAmerica's variable annuity business due to equity market conditions, and an increase in incurred but not reported (IBNR) death claim reserves.
    Net investment income reflected a slight decline in base yields (12 basis points), as investment purchases in late 2010 and 2011 were made at yields lower than the weighted average yields of the existing base portfolio. The lower yields were partially offset by an increase in income from the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011. The following decreases in investment enhancement items also contributed to lower net investment income in 2011 compared to 2010:
 - 
$471 million decrease in valuation gains on ML II;
 - 
$196 million lower call and tender income;
 - 
$163 million of losses from equity-method investments in two trusts created by AIG to hold leased commercial aircraft, in which SunAmerica has non-voting preferred equity and debt interests. The losses reflect aircraft impairments recorded by the trusts in 2011 based on reviews of aircraft recoverability, which consider projected undiscounted future cash flows subject to assumptions based on current macroeconomic and industry trends and conditions; and
 - 
$121 million decrease in private equity funds and hedge funds income.
    DAC amortization and policyholder benefit expenses related to weaker equity market conditions were $26 million in 2011, compared to an $107 million reduction to expenses due to more favorable equity market conditions in 2010. In a weak equity market, SunAmerica increases policyholder benefit reserves to recognize the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance for certain guaranteed benefits features of variable annuities. The DAC asset related to these products may also be adjusted through amortization expense, to reflect updates of future estimated gross profits due to equity market assumptions. The effect on the estimated gross profits of variable products of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets are mitigated in part through the use of a reversion to mean methodology. Under this methodology, SunAmerica assumes a long-term growth rate for the assets backing these liabilities, which factors in potential short-term fluctuations in the financial markets, and if the long-term growth rate assumption is deemed to be unreasonable in light of the current market conditions, the long-term growth rate assumption is revised upward or downward to reflect the revised estimate. See Note 2(g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
AIG Form 8-K            41
    SunAmerica recorded an increase of approximately $202 million in the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims in 2011 in conjunction with the use of the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) to identify potential claims not yet filed with its life insurance companies. Although SunAmerica has enhanced its claims practices to include use of the SSDMF, it is possible that industry-wide regulatory inquiries, audits and other regulatory activity could result in the payment of additional death claims, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties and interest.
    Offsetting these decreases in operating income was $226 million of legal settlement net proceeds received in 2011. In three separate agreements, SAFG Retirement Services, Inc. (SAFG), formerly known as AIG Retirement Services, Inc. agreed to resolve its claims in the matter titled AIG Retirement Services, Inc. v. Altus Finance S.A. et al.
    Other acquisition and insurance expenses declined $123 million, or 6 percent, compared to 2010, primarily due to legal expense accruals and state guaranty fund assessments which were higher in 2010, as well as a reduction in the cost of letters of credit related to reinsurance.
    Pre-tax income for SunAmerica reflected net realized capital gains in 2011 compared to net realized capital losses in 2010 due principally to a $981 million decline in other-than-temporary impairments, a decline in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GIC) reserves, and declines in the allowance for mortgage loans. These improvements were partially offset by a $465 million increase in fair value losses of embedded derivatives, net of economic hedges, relating to variable annuity products with living benefit guarantees, compared to 2010, driven by declines in long-term interest rates. Due to statutory capital considerations, a significant portion of the interest rate exposure related to these variable annuity contract features is unhedged.
    SunAmerica periodically evaluates the estimates used to establish its liabilities for future policy benefits and DAC. These estimates may be adjusted based on actual experience and management judgment regarding assumptions which include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns. These current best estimates are used to determine whether to adjust DAC and record additional liabilities when unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investment securities are recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income, at each balance sheet date, as if the securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. An actual sale of the underlying securities could trigger an actual loss recognition event that would result in the amortization of DAC and the recognition of higher reserves through policyholder benefit expense due to a deficiency in future earnings. Primarily as a result of the low interest rate environment in 2011, SunAmerica recorded additional future policy benefits and adjustments to DAC totaling $1.6 billion, net of tax, as of December 31, 2011, which were charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and included within the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    SunAmerica reported an increase in operating income in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher net investment income and favorable changes in DAC and SIA amortization and policyholder benefit expenses due to improved equity market conditions in 2010 relative to 2009.
    Higher net investment income in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected the following:
 - 
$699 million increase in private equity funds and hedge funds income;
 - 
$539 million increase in valuation gains on ML II; and
 - 
$279 million higher call and tender income.
    In 2009, DAC and SIA amortization unlocking and related reserve strengthening charges of $584 million were primarily due to reductions in the long-term growth assumptions and deteriorated equity market conditions early in 2009 for group retirement products and individual variable annuities, and projected increases in surrenders for individual fixed annuities. The 2010 unlocking and reserve strengthening was not significant.
42            AIG Form 8-K
    The improvement in the pre-tax results for SunAmerica in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected a decline in net realized capital losses due principally to a significant decline in other-than-temporary impairments, and an increase in net realized gains from the sale of investments in 2010 partially offset by affordable housing partnership impairments and an increase in fair value losses on derivatives primarily used to hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange movements on GIC reserves. See Results of Operations  Consolidated Results  Premiums;  Net Investment Income; and  Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses) herein.
Other Operations
    The components of AIG's Other operations were revised in the third quarter of 2011, primarily as a result of the reclassification of non-aircraft leasing operations from the Financial Services reportable segment as discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as follows:
 - 
AIGFP's derivatives portfolio, previously reported as a component of the Financial Services reportable segment, is now reported with AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) as Global Capital Markets in Other Operations.
 - 
AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp. operations and Institutional Asset Management, previously reported as components of Direct Investment book and Asset Management operations within Other operations, respectively, are now reported in Corporate & Other.
    AIG's Other operations include the following:
 - 
Mortgage Guaranty 
UGC subsidiaries issue residential mortgage guaranty insurance, both domestically and to a lesser extent internationally, that covers mortgage lenders from the first loss for credit defaults on high loan-to-value conventional first-lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of one-to four-family residences.
 - 
Global Capital Markets 
consist of the operations of AIG Markets and the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio. AIG Markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between AIG companies and third parties. The active wind-down of the AIGFP derivatives portfolio was completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Although the remaining AIGFP derivatives portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility, the portfolio consists predominantly of transactions AIG believes are of low complexity, low risk, supportive of AIG's risk management objectives or not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis. AIGFP is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio.
 - 
Direct Investment book 
includes results for the MIP and the results of certain non-derivative assets and liabilities of AIGFP.
 - 
Retained Interests 
Fair value gains or losses on AIG's remaining interest in AIA ordinary shares retained following the AIA initial public offering, the retained interest in ML III, and, prior to their sale on March 8, 2011, the MetLife securities that were received as consideration from the sale of ALICO.
 - 
Corporate & Other 
consists primarily of interest expense, intercompany interest income that is eliminated in consolidation, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments (including restructuring costs), expenses related to internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses, corporate-level net realized capital gains and losses, certain litigation-related charges and credits, and net gains and losses on sales of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment.
 - 
Divested Businesses
  include operating results of certain businesses that have been divested that did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations classification, primarily consisting of AIA in 2010.

2011 and 2010 Comparison
    UGC recorded a pre-tax loss in 2011 compared to pre-tax income in 2010, primarily due to:
 - 
an increase in claims and claims adjustment expenses of $334 million, primarily in first-lien business, reflecting increased overturns of denied and rescinded claims and unfavorable first-lien loss development of $76 million in 2011, compared to favorable loss development of $385 million in 2010, partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, and a reduction in reserves due to an agreement to resolve certain delinquencies with a major European lender that resulted in a $43 million benefit;
 - 
declines in earned premiums from the second-lien, private student loan and international businesses, which were placed into runoff during 2008, partially offset by an increase in earned premiums from first-lien business; and
 - 
the accrual of $22 million to pay for previously rescinded losses, certain legal fees and interest in connection with an adverse judgment. UGC has appealed the court's decision.
    Partially offsetting these declines was a reduction in underwriting expenses compared to 2010 reflecting a $94 million accrual of estimated remedy losses in 2010. Remedy losses represent the indemnification for losses incurred by lenders arising from obligations contractually assumed by UGC as a result of underwriting services provided to lenders during times of high loan origination activity. UGC believes it has adequately accrued for these losses at December 31, 2011. Pre-tax income for 2010 also includes gains of approximately $150 million from legal settlements and reinsurance commutations.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Mortgage Guaranty reported pre-tax income in 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in 2009, driven by:
 - 
favorable prior year reserve development, primarily in first liens, due to increased cures, rescissions and claims denials, compared to unfavorable development in 2009;
 - 
gains of $150 million in 2010 from legal settlements and reinsurance commutations; and
 - 
lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first-lien, second-lien and international products, partially offset by increased delinquencies in private student loans. During 2010, UGC commuted the majority of its private student loan portfolio.
    Partially offsetting the improved 2010 results were:
 - 
lower earned premiums in first-lien, second-lien, and international businesses in 2010;
 - 
the accrual of $94 million of remedy losses in 2010 as noted above; and
 - 
the amortization of the second-lien premium deficiency reserve of $222 million in 2009.

Global Capital Markets Operations
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    Global Capital Markets reported a pre-tax loss in 2011 compared to pre-tax income in 2010 primarily due to a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains related to the AIGFP super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio and losses in 2011 compared to gains in 2010 on the AIGFP CDS contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits, which are not included in the AIGFP super senior CDS portfolio. These items were partially offset by improvements related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the credit valuation adjustments of AIGFP's derivative assets and liabilities. During 2011, AIGFP recorded an unrealized market valuation gain on its super senior CDS portfolio of $339 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $598 million in 2010. The reduction in gains resulted primarily from CDS transactions written on multi-sector CDOs driven by price declines of the underlying assets. AIGFP also recognized a loss of $23 million in 2011 on CDS contracts referencing single-name exposures as compared to a gain of $149 million in 2010 due to a decline in market conditions. During 2011, AIGFP recognized a net credit valuation adjustment loss on derivative assets and liabilities of $53 million compared to a net credit valuation adjustment loss of $200 million in 2010 due to a narrowing of corporate spreads.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    Global Capital Markets reported lower pre-tax income in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower unrealized market valuation gains related to the AIGFP super senior CDS portfolio and the significant decrease related to the net effect of changes in credit spreads on the credit valuation adjustments of AIGFP's derivative assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower costs related to the continued wind-down of AIGFP's businesses and portfolios. During 2010, AIGFP recorded an unrealized market valuation gain on its super senior CDS portfolio of $598 million compared to an unrealized market valuation gain of $1.4 billion in 2009. During 2010, AIGFP recognized a net credit valuation adjustment loss on derivative assets and liabilities of $200 million compared to a net credit valuation adjustment gain of $775 million in 2009.

Direct Investment Book Results
2011 and 2010 Comparison
    The Direct Investment book pre-tax income decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower net gains on credit valuation adjustments on non-derivative assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option and lower interest income in the MIP due to approximately $4.9 billion in sales of investments during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 to increase liquidity. These declines were partially offset by significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities.
2010 and 2009 Comparison
    The Direct Investment book pre-tax income decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to lower net gains on credit valuation adjustments on non-derivative assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option, partially offset by significantly lower other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturity securities.
46            AIG Form 8-K
The following table presents credit valuation adjustment gains (losses) for the Direct Investment book (excluding intercompany transactions):
Change in Fair Value of the MetLife Securities Prior to Sale
    AIG recognized a loss in 2011, representing the decline in the securities' value, due to market conditions, from December 31, 2010 through the date of their sale in the first quarter of 2011.
Change in Fair Value of AIA Securities
    AIG recognized a $1.3 billion gain in 2011, a 12 percent increase in the value of AIG's 33 percent interest in AIA, which is recorded in Other invested assets and accounted for under the fair value method. In 2010, AIG recognized a $638 million loss on its interest in AIA during the approximate two month holding period following the initial public offering in late October 2010.
Change in Fair Value of ML III
    The loss attributable to AIG's interest in ML III for 2011 was due to significant spread widening and reduced interest rates.
    The gain of $1.8 billion on ML III for 2010 was attributable to the shortening of weighted average life by 1.34 years. Additionally, fair value for 2010 was positively affected by a decrease in projected credit losses in the underlying collateral securities. During 2010, credit spreads tightened by 287 basis points.
AIG Form 8-K            47
Corporate & Other
    Corporate & Other reported pre-tax losses of $5.7 billion in 2011 compared to pre-tax gains of $11.4 billion in 2010 primarily due to gains on sales of divested businesses in 2010, primarily related to AIA, partially offset by:
 - 
a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility;
 - 
a reduction in other corporate expenses due to the securities litigation charges recorded in 2010; and
 - 
a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $484 million resulting from the exchange of outstanding junior subordinated debentures for senior notes pursuant to an exchange offer.
    These improvements were mostly offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 billion in connection with the Recapitalization, primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility and net realized capital losses recorded in 2011 compared to net realized capital gains in 2010.
    Corporate & Other reported pre-tax income in 2010 compared to a pre-tax loss in 2009 primarily due to the following:
 - 
a decline in interest expense on the FRBNY Credit Facility; and
 - 
gains on sales of divested businesses in 2010, primarily related to AIA, compared to losses in 2009.
Divested Businesses
    Divested businesses include the operating results of divested businesses that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting through the date of their sale. The Divested businesses results for 2010 primarily represent the historical results of AIA, which was deconsolidated in November 2010 in conjunction with its initial public offering.
CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The following table presents AIG's consolidated comprehensive income (loss):
48            AIG Form 8-K
Change in Unrealized Appreciation of Investments
    The $5.5 billion increase in 2011 was primarily attributable to continued appreciation in bonds available for sale of $0.7 billion and $4.6 billion recognized by Chartis and SunAmerica, respectively, due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and declines in U.S. Treasury rates, which were partially offset by widening spreads.
    The $9.9 billion increase in 2010 primarily reflects the $0.6 billion and $7.0 billion appreciation in bonds available for sale held by Chartis and SunAmerica operations, respectively, due to lower U.S. Treasury rates and slightly narrowed spreads. The structured securities portfolio accounted for more than half of the positive change in 2010, as RMBS and CMBS continued to recover from the distressed pricing levels of the financial crisis. The increase in 2010 also includes $578 million of appreciation in available-for-sale equities held by Chartis.
    The $33.2 billion in unrealized appreciation for 2009 reflects $30.2 billion and $2.9 billion in appreciation in bonds and equities available for sale, respectively, related to the continued recovery of the global financial markets in 2009, as investors returned to equity and bond markets.
Change in Deferred Acquisition Costs Adjustment and Other
    The decline in deferred acquisition costs in all periods is primarily the result of increases in the unrealized appreciation of investments supporting interest-sensitive products. The decline since 2009 reflects the divestiture of multiple life insurance operations, including the sales of Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison in 2011, the deconsolidation of AIA in 2010 and sale of ALICO in 2010.
Change in Future Policy Benefits
    AIG periodically evaluates the assumptions used to establish its deferred acquisition costs and future policy benefits. These assumptions may be adjusted based on actual experience and management judgment. Key assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns.
    Primarily as a result of the significant decline in interest rates during the latter half of 2011 and updated assumptions for mortality experience, AIG recorded additional future policy benefits through other comprehensive income. This change in future policy benefits assumes the securities underlying certain traditional long-duration products had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and reinvested at current yields.
Change in Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments
    Increases in foreign currency translation adjustments for all periods primarily reflect the weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies. The decline in foreign currency translation adjustments over the three-year period reflects the divestiture of multiple foreign operations, including the sales of Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison in 2011, the deconsolidation of AIA in 2010 and the sale of ALICO in 2010.
Change in Net Derivative Gains (Losses) Arising from Cash Flow Hedging Activities
    The decline in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects the gradual wind-down of the cash flow hedge portfolio in 2011, 2010 and 2009, partially offset by a decline in the interest rate environment.
Retirement Plan Liabilities Adjustment
    The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to the announced redesign and resulting remeasurement of the AIG Retirement and AIG Excess Plans, which will be converted to cash balance plans effective April 1, 2012. AIG recognized a $590 million pre-tax reduction to Accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with the remeasurement at September 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate since December 31, 2010. This decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive income was partially offset by the effect of the increase in the discount rate in the fourth quarter in connection with the year end remeasurement.
AIG Form 8-K            49
    In 2010 and 2009, the effect of declining discount rates on pension benefit obligations was offset by the appreciation of investments held by the respective plans.
    See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Divestitures and Deconsolidations
    The change attributable to divestitures and deconsolidations in every period reflects the derecognition of all items in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the point of sale/deconsolidation for all entities, including domestic entities. In 2011, the most significant entities were AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan. In 2010, the most significant entities were AIA and ALICO. In 2009, the most significant entities were Transatlantic, 21st Century and HSB.
Deferred Taxes on Other Comprehensive Income
    For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Loss was 9.1 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory 35 percent rate primarily due to the effects of the Nan Shan disposition.
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Income was 42.5 percent, primarily due to the effects of the AIA initial public offering, the ALICO disposition and changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries, including AIG Star and AIG Edison.
    For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate on pre-tax Other Comprehensive Income was 34.7 percent, which did not materially differ from the statutory 35 percent rate.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:
 - 
estimates with respect to income taxes, including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax asset;
 - 
recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), flight equipment, and reinsurance;
 - 
insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;
 - 
estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;
 - 
impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments;
 - 
liabilities for legal contingencies; and
 - 
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including CDS and AIG's economic interest in ML II and equity interest in ML III.
    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's financial condition and results of operations would be directly affected.
    Except for the items noted below, no other critical accounting estimates in the 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K are being updated in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
50            AIG Form 8-K
RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET:
    AIG considers the recoverability of its deferred tax asset to be a critical accounting estimate. The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.
    AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets weighs the sustainability of recent operating profitability, the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, and AIG's emergence from cumulative losses in recent years. The framework requires AIG to consider all available evidence, including:
 - 
the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses in recent years;
 - 
the sustainability of recent operating profitability of AIG's subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions;
 - 
the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;
 - 
the carryforward periods for the net operating loss (NOL), capital loss and foreign tax credit (FTC) carryforwards, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences; and,
 - 
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax assets.
    During 2011, AIG experienced significant favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios, the sale of certain businesses, emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and a return to sustainable operating profits within its primary operations. During 2011, AIG's level of profitability, excluding the $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt in January, confirmed its return to sustainable operating profit for the full year. This, together with the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and projections of sufficient future taxable income, represents significant positive evidence. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the historical negative evidence regarding the likelihood that the deferred tax asset for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group (other than the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards) will be realized. This assessment was evidenced by AIG meeting all of the criteria in its framework, resulting in its conclusion that $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released in 2011. The life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards may be realized in the future if and when, either capital gains are realized or when prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are identified that result in an assessment that the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards will be realized on a more-likely-than-not basis prior to the expiration of such capital loss carryforwards.
    In order to demonstrate the predictability and sufficiency of future taxable income necessary to support the realizability of the NOLs, FTCs and nonlife capital loss carryforwards related to the $18.4 billion valuation allowance release, AIG considered its forecasts of future income for each of its businesses using comparisons to historical results, and actual and planned business and operational changes, which included assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG-specific conditions and events. AIG also subjected the forecasts to stresses (considering various adverse AIG- specific and macro-economic risks) of key assumptions and evaluated the effect on tax attribute utilization. Management also stressed its assumptions related to the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. AIG's income forecasts coupled with its tax planning strategies (as well as stressed scenarios), all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes (other than life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards) prior to their expiration.
AIG Form 8-K            51
U.S. INCOME TAXES ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES:
    Due to the complexity of the U.S. federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between book carrying value and tax basis of subsidiaries, as well as the level of judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability, AIG considers the U.S. federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate.
DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS  SHORT DURATION (CHARTIS):
    Recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months for short-duration insurance contracts. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.
    AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium and anticipated investment income on in-force business to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses, anticipated maintenance costs and unamortized DAC. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge.
    For short-duration insurance contracts, starting on January 1, 2012, AIG has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether DAC is recoverable. AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy, as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there are no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.
    Management tested the recoverability of DAC and determined that recorded unearned premiums and anticipated investment income of its Chartis operations exceeded the sum of these costs at December 31, 2011.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of American International Group, Inc.:
     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American International Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIG) at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, AIG maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control  Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). AIG's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in the 2011 Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on AIG's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
    As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, AIG changed the manner in which it accounts for the costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts and the presentation of its comprehensive income. As described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, AIG changed the manner in which it accounts for other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities as of April 1, 2009.
    A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
    American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading international insurance organization serving customers in more than 130 countries. AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through one of the most extensive worldwide property-casualty networks of any insurer. In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of life insurance and retirement services in the United States.
    Since September 2008, AIG has been working to protect and enhance the value of its key businesses, execute an orderly asset disposition plan, and position itself for the future. AIG has entered into several important transactions and relationships with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), the AIG Credit Facility Trust (together with its trustees, acting in their capacity as trustees, the Trust) and the United States Department of the Treasury (the Department of the Treasury) during this period. As a result of the series of integrated transactions to recapitalize AIG, on January 14, 2011, the Department of the Treasury became the holder of 92 percent of AIG's outstanding common stock, par value $2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock). In May 2011, AIG completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock (the May Common Stock Offering), which resulted in a reduction of the Department of the Treasury's ownership to approximately 77 percent. See Significant Events below for further information.
    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG, its controlled subsidiaries (through a greater than 50 percent ownership of voting rights of a voting interest entity), and variable interest entities (VIEs) in which AIG is the primary beneficiary. Entities that AIG does not consolidate, but in which it holds 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting rights or otherwise has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method unless AIG has elected the fair value option. On October 29, 2010, AIG completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 8.08 billion ordinary shares of AIA Group Limited (AIA), upon the completion of which AIG owned approximately 33 percent of AIA's outstanding shares. AIG accounts for its investment in AIA under the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in Net investment income.
    Certain of AIG's foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements report on different fiscal period bases, in most cases ending November 30. The effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition and results of operations of all material events occurring at these subsidiaries between the fiscal year end and December 31 for all periods presented has been recorded.
    The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES
    The preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers the accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of:
 - 
estimates with respect to income taxes, including the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the predictability of future tax planning strategies and operating profitability of the character necessary for their realization;
 - 
recoverability of assets, including deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC), flight equipment, and reinsurance;
 - 
insurance liabilities, including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts;
 - 
estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products;
AIG Form 8-K            63
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments;
 - 
liabilities for legal contingencies; and
 - 
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities, including credit default swaps (CDS) and AIG's economic interest in Maiden Lane II LLC (ML II) and equity interest in Maiden Lane III LLC (ML III) (together, the Maiden Lane Interests).
    These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
RECLASSIFICATIONS, REVISIONS AND SEGMENT CHANGES
    Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation for the following items.
    Due to changes in the relative composition of AIG's remaining continuing operations as a result of the substantial completion of AIG's asset disposition plan, AIG began presenting separately the following line items on its Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning in 2011:
(a)
Represents fees recognized from universal life and investment-type products, consisting of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration charges, amortization of unearned revenue reserves and surrender charges.
(b)
Represents interest on account-value-based policyholder deposits, consisting of amounts credited on non-equity-indexed account values, accretion to the host contract for equity indexed products, and net amortization of sales inducements.
    On January 1, 2012, AIG retrospectively adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. See Note 2(v) herein for discussion of revisions to the consolidated financial statements.
    In order to align financial reporting with the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to allocate resources and assess performance, changes were made during 2011 and 2012 to AIG's segment information. See Note 3 herein for additional information on AIG's segment changes.
    Additionally, certain other reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 4 herein for reclassifications to prior period amounts attributable to discontinued operations.
    On January 1, 2012, AIG adopted an accounting standard that requires the presentation of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components, followed consecutively by a second statement that presents total other comprehensive income and its components. The adoption of this standard resulted in the inclusion of statements of comprehensive income in Note 24 herein. The standard did not have any effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
    During 2011, AIG completed the Recapitalization (described below), executed transactions in the debt and equity capital markets and substantially completed its asset disposition plan.
Recapitalization
    On January 14, 2011 (the Closing), AIG completed a series of integrated transactions to recapitalize AIG (the Recapitalization) with the Department of the Treasury, the FRBNY and the Trust, including the repayment of all amounts owed under the Credit Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2008 (as amended, the FRBNY Credit Facility). At the Closing, AIG recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt, primarily representing $3.3 billion in accelerated amortization of the remaining prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility.
Repayment and Termination of the FRBNY Credit Facility
    At the Closing, AIG repaid to the FRBNY approximately $21 billion in cash, representing complete repayment of all amounts owed under the FRBNY Credit Facility, and the FRBNY Credit Facility was terminated. The funds for the repayment came from the net cash proceeds from AIG's sale of 67 percent of the ordinary shares of AIA in its initial public offering and from AIG's sale of American Life Insurance Company (ALICO) in 2010. These funds were loaned to AIG in the form of secured limited recourse debt from the special purpose vehicles that held the proceeds of the AIA IPO and the ALICO sale (the AIA SPV and the ALICO SPV, respectively, and collectively, the SPVs). The loan from the ALICO SPV was repaid in full during 2011. The loan from the AIA SPV is secured by pledges and any proceeds received from the sale by AIG and certain of its subsidiaries of, among other collateral, all or part of their equity interest in International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC or the Designated Entity). Proceeds from the sales of the remaining ordinary shares of AIA held by the AIA SPV will be used to pay down the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's preferred interests in the AIA SPV (the AIA SPV Preferred Interests) (described below). Until their respective sales on February 1, 2011 and August 18, 2011 as further discussed in Sales of Divested Businesses below, AIG's Japan-based life insurance subsidiaries, AIG Star Life Insurance Company Ltd. (AIG Star) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG Edison), and Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan), were also Designated Entities.
Repurchase and Exchange of SPV Preferred Interests
    At the Closing, AIG drew down approximately $20.3 billion (the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount) under the Department of the Treasury's commitment (the Department of the Treasury Commitment (Series F)) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 17, 2009 (the Series F SPA), between AIG and the Department of the Treasury relating to AIG's Series F Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series F Preferred Stock). The Series F Closing Drawdown Amount was the full amount remaining under the Department of the Treasury Commitment (Series F), less $2 billion that AIG designated to be available after the closing for general corporate purposes under a commitment relating to AIG's Series G Cumulative Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series G Preferred Stock), described below (the Series G Drawdown Right). The right of AIG to draw on the Department of the Treasury Commitment (Series F) (other than the Series G Drawdown Right) was terminated.
    AIG used the Series F Closing Drawdown Amount to repurchase all of the FRBNY's AIA SPV Preferred Interests and the preferred interests in the ALICO SPV (together with the AIA SPV Preferred Interests, the SPV Preferred Interests). AIG transferred the SPV Preferred Interests to the Department of the Treasury as part of the consideration for the exchange of the Series F Preferred Stock (described below).
AIG Form 8-K            65
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    The Department of the Treasury, so long as it holds AIA SPV Preferred Interests, has the right, subject to existing contractual restrictions, to require AIG to dispose of the remaining AIA ordinary shares held by the AIA SPV to the extent necessary to fully repay the liquidation preference on the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests. In addition, the consent of the Department of the Treasury, so long as it holds SPV Preferred Interests, will be required for AIG to take specified significant actions with respect to the Designated Entity, ILFC, including an IPO, sales, significant acquisitions or dispositions and incurrence of specified levels of indebtedness. If any SPV Preferred Interests are outstanding on May 1, 2013, the Department of the Treasury will have the right to compel the sale of all or a portion of ILFC on terms that it will determine.
    As a result of these transactions, the AIA SPV Preferred Interests are no longer considered permanent equity on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are classified as Redeemable noncontrolling nonvoting, callable, junior preferred interests held by the Department of the Treasury.
Issuance and Cancellation of AIG's Series G Preferred Stock
    At the Closing, AIG and the Department of the Treasury amended and restated the Series F SPA to provide for the issuance of 20,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock by AIG to the Department of the Treasury. The Series G Preferred Stock was issued with a liquidation preference of zero. Because the net proceeds to AIG from the completion of the registered public offering of AIG Common Stock in the May Common Stock Offering of $2.9 billion exceeded the $2.0 billion Series G Drawdown Right, the Series G Drawdown Right was terminated and the Series G Preferred Stock was cancelled immediately thereafter.
Exchange of AIG's Series C, E and F Preferred Stock for AIG Common Stock and Series G Preferred Stock
    At the Closing:
 - 
the shares of AIG's Series C Perpetual, Convertible, Participating Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series C Preferred Stock), held by the Trust, were exchanged for 562,868,096 shares of newly issued AIG Common Stock, which were subsequently transferred by the Trust to the Department of the Treasury;
 - 
the shares of AIG's Series E Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $5.00 per share (the Series E Preferred Stock), held by the Department of the Treasury, were exchanged for 924,546,133 newly issued shares of AIG Common Stock; and
 - 
the shares of the Series F Preferred Stock held by the Department of the Treasury, were exchanged for (a) the SPV Preferred Interests, (b) 20,000 shares of the Series G Preferred Stock (subsequently cancelled) and (c) 167,623,733 shares of newly issued AIG Common Stock.
    The issuance of AIG Common Stock to the Department of the Treasury described above significantly affected the determination of Net income (loss) attributable to AIG common shareholders and the weighted average shares outstanding, both of which are used to compute earnings per share. See Note 17 herein for further discussion.
    AIG entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) with the Department of the Treasury that granted the Department of the Treasury registration rights with respect to the shares of AIG Common Stock issued at the Closing. The May Common Stock Offering was conducted in accordance with the right of AIG under the Registration Rights Agreement to complete a registered primary offering of AIG Common Stock. Current rights of the Department of the Treasury under the Registration Rights Agreement include:
 - 
the right to participate in any future registered offering of AIG Common Stock by AIG;
66            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
the right to demand that AIG effect a registered market offering of its shares no more than twice in any 12-month period;
 - 
the right to engage in at-the-market offerings; and
 - 
subject to certain exceptions, the right to approve the terms, conditions and pricing of any registered offering in which it participates until its ownership falls below 33 percent of AIG's voting securities.
    AIG has the right to raise the greater of $2 billion and the amount of the projected liquidity shortfall if the AIG Board of Directors determines, after consultation with the Department of the Treasury, that due to events affecting AIG's insurance subsidiaries, AIG Parent's reasonably projected aggregate liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and commitments of credit) will fall below $8 billion within 12 months of the date of such determination.
    Until the Department of the Treasury's ownership of AIG's voting securities falls below 33 percent, the Department of the Treasury will, subject to certain exceptions, have complete control over the terms, conditions and pricing of any offering in which it participates, including any primary offering by AIG. As a result, if AIG seeks to conduct an offering of its equity securities the Department of the Treasury may decide to participate in the offering, and to prevent AIG from selling any equity securities.
Issuance of Warrants to Purchase AIG Common Stock
    On January 19, 2011, as part of the Recapitalization, AIG issued to the holders of record of AIG Common Stock as of January 13, 2011, by means of a dividend, ten-year warrants to purchase a total of 74,997,778 shares of AIG Common Stock at an exercise price of $45.00 per share. AIG retained 67,650 of these warrants for tax withholding purposes. No warrants were issued to the Trust, the Department of the Treasury or the FRBNY.
May 2011 Common Stock Offering and Sale
    On May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. Of the net proceeds AIG received from this offering, $550 million has been used to fund the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation settlement (see Note 16 herein). As required by the Registration Rights Agreement, AIG paid the underwriting discount as well as certain expenses with respect to the shares sold by the Department of the Treasury. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. As a result of the sale of AIG Common Stock in this offering, the Series G Drawdown Right was terminated, the Series G Preferred Stock was cancelled and the ownership by the Department of the Treasury was reduced from approximately 92 percent to approximately 77 percent of the AIG Common Stock outstanding after the completion of the offering.
September 2011 Debt Offering
    On September 13, 2011, AIG issued $1.2 billion of 4.250% Notes Due 2014 and $800 million of 4.875% Notes Due 2016. The proceeds are being used to pay maturing notes issued by AIG to fund the Matched Investment Program (MIP).
October 2011 Syndicated Credit and Contingent Liquidity Facilities
    On October 12, 2011, the previously outstanding AIG 364-Day Syndicated Facility, AIG 3-Year Syndicated Facility and Chartis letter of credit facility were terminated and AIG entered into a $1.5 billion 364-Day
AIG Form 8-K            67
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Syndicated Facility and a $3.0 billion 4-Year Syndicated Facility. The new 4-Year Syndicated Facility provides for $3.0 billion of revolving loans, which includes a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit. The $1.3 billion of previously issued letters of credit under the Chartis letter of credit facility were rolled into the letter of credit sublimit within the 4-Year Syndicated Facility, so that a total of $1.7 billion remains available under this facility, of which $0.2 billion is available for letters of credit. AIG expects that it may draw down on these facilities from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
    In December 2010, AIG established a $500 million contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the right, prior to December 15, 2015, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the counterparty, based on a put option agreement between AIG and the counterparty. The senior debt, if issued, will mature on December 15, 2015.
    In October 2011, AIG entered into an additional contingent liquidity facility. Under this facility, AIG has the right, for a period of one year, to enter into put option agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of up to $500 million, with an unaffiliated international financial institution pursuant to which AIG has the right, for a period of five years from the date any such put option agreement is entered into, to issue up to $500 million in senior debt to the financial institution, at AIG's discretion.
November 2011 Exchange Offer
    In November 2011, AIG exchanged specified series of its outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures for newly issued senior notes pursuant to an exchange offer. The exchange resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $484 million, which is reflected in Net loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and a deferred gain of $65 million, included in Other long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which will be amortized as a reduction to future interest expense. See Note 15 herein for additional information on this transaction.
Sales of Businesses
    On January 12, 2011, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent interest in Nan Shan to a Taiwan-based consortium. The transaction closed on August 18, 2011 for net proceeds of $2.15 billion in cash. The net proceeds from the transaction were used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.
    On February 1, 2011, AIG completed the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison to Prudential Financial, Inc., for $4.8 billion, consisting of $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in the assumption of third-party debt. Of the $4.2 billion in cash, AIG retained $2 billion to support the capital of Chartis, Inc. (Chartis) and its subsidiaries pursuant to an agreement with the Department of the Treasury, and caused the remaining amount to be applied to pay down a portion of liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests. AIG recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion on the date of the sale which is reflected in Income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    See Note 4 herein for additional information on these transactions and Note 16 for discussion of indemnification provisions.
Sale of MetLife Securities
    On March 1, 2011, AIG entered into a Coordination Agreement among the ALICO SPV, AIG and MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) regarding a series of integrated transactions (the MetLife Disposition) whereby MetLife agreed to allow AIG to offer for sale earlier than contemplated under the original terms of the ALICO sale (the ALICO Sale) the MetLife securities that AIG received when it sold ALICO to MetLife. The MetLife Disposition included (i) the sale of MetLife common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the sale of common equity units of
68            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MetLife pursuant to two separate underwritten public offerings and (ii) the sale by the ALICO SPV of MetLife preferred stock to MetLife.
    In connection with the MetLife Disposition, on March 1, 2011, AIG and the ALICO SPV entered into a letter agreement with the Department of the Treasury pursuant to which AIG and the ALICO SPV received the consent of the Department of the Treasury to the MetLife Disposition. AIG completed the MetLife Disposition on March 8, 2011 for a total of $9.6 billion and used $6.6 billion of the proceeds to pay down all of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's ALICO SPV Preferred Interests and a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests. In the first quarter of 2011, AIG recognized a loss of $348 million, representing the decline in the value of the MetLife securities from December 31, 2010 through their disposition on March 8, 2011, due to market conditions prior to the MetLife Disposition. Of this amount, $191 million is reflected in Net realized capital gains (losses) and $157 million is reflected in Net investment income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The remaining proceeds were placed in escrow to secure indemnities provided to MetLife under the original terms of the ALICO stock purchase agreement as described in Note 16 herein.
LIQUIDITY ASSESSMENT
    In assessing AIG's current financial flexibility and developing operating plans for the future, management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potential financial and liquidity effects of AIG's risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to:
 - 
the potential effect of changes in bond, equity and foreign exchange markets on contingent liquidity requirements;
 - 
the potential effect on AIG if the capital levels of its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans;
 - 
AIG's continued ability to generate cash flow from operations;
 - 
the potential adverse effects on AIG's businesses that could result if there are further downgrades by rating agencies; and
 - 
the potential for regulatory limitations on AIG's business in one or more countries.
    AIG believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet its obligations, including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies and events.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (a) Revenue recognition and expenses:
    Premiums:
    Premiums for short duration contracts are recorded as written on the inception date of the policy. Premiums are earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. The reserve for unearned premiums includes the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Reinsurance premiums under a reinsurance contract are typically earned over the same period as the underlying policies, or risks, covered by the contracts. As a result, the earning pattern of a reinsurance contract may extend up to 24 months, reflecting the inception dates of the underlying policies.
    Reinsurance premiums ceded are expensed over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided in proportion to the risks to which they relate.
    Premiums for long duration insurance products and life contingent annuities are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet collected are accrued.
    Policy fees:
    Policy fees represent fees recognized from universal life and investment-type products consisting of policy charges for the cost of insurance, policy administration charges, amortization of unearned revenue reserves and surrender charges.
    Net investment income:
    Net investment income represents income primarily from the following sources in AIG's insurance operations and AIG Parent:
 - 
Interest income and related expenses, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on bonds with changes in the timing and the amount of expected principal and interest cash flows reflected in the yield, as applicable.
 - 
Dividend income from common and preferred stock and distributions from other investments.
 - 
Realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading securities accounted for at fair value.
 - 
Earnings from private equity funds and hedge fund investments accounted for under the equity method.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
The difference between the carrying amount of a life settlement contract and the life insurance proceeds of the underlying life insurance policy recorded in income upon the death of the insured.
 - 
Changes in the fair values of AIG's interests in ML II, ML III, AIA and MetLife securities prior to sale.
    Net realized capital gains (losses):
    Net realized capital gains and losses are determined by specific identification. The net realized capital gains and losses are generated primarily from the following sources:
 - 
Sales of fixed maturity securities and equity securities (except trading securities accounted for at fair value), real estate, investments in private equity funds and hedge funds and other types of investments.
 - 
Reductions to the cost basis of fixed maturity securities and equity securities (except trading securities accounted for at fair value) and other invested assets for other-than-temporary impairments.
 - 
Changes in fair value of derivatives except for (1) those instruments at AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group Inc. and their respective subsidiaries (collectively, AIGFP), (2) those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment when the change in the fair value of the hedged item is not reported in Net realized capital gains (losses), and (3) those instruments that are designated as economic hedges of financial instruments for which the fair value option has been elected.
 - 
Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions.
    Aircraft leasing revenue:
    Income from flight equipment under operating leases is recognized over the life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for additional payments contingent on usage. In those cases, rental income is recognized at the time such usage occurs, net of estimated future contractual aircraft maintenance reimbursements. Gains on sales of flight equipment are recognized in Other income when flight equipment is sold and the risk of ownership of the equipment is passed to the new owner.
    Other income:
    Other income includes unrealized gains and losses on derivatives, including unrealized market valuation gains and losses associated with AIGFP's super senior credit default swap (CDS) portfolio, as well as income from the Direct Investment book.
    Other income from the operations of the Direct Investment book and AIG's Other Operations category consists of the following:
 - 
Change in fair value relating to financial assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected.
 - 
Interest income and related expenses, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on bonds with changes in the timing and the amount of expected principal and interest cash flows reflected in the yield, as applicable.
 - 
Dividend income from common and preferred stock and distributions from other investments.
 - 
Changes in the fair value of trading securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, futures, hybrid financial instruments, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase for which the fair value option was elected.
 - 
Realized capital gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities and investments in private equity funds and hedge funds and other investments.
 - 
Income earned on real estate based investments and related losses from property level impairments and financing costs.

 - 
Gains and losses recognized in earnings on derivatives for the effective portion and their related hedged items.
    Policyholder benefits and claims incurred:
    Incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses for short duration insurance contracts consist of the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims incurred within the reporting period, including incurred but not reported claims, plus the changes in estimates of current and prior period losses resulting from the continuous review process, which are charged to income as incurred. Benefits for long duration insurance contracts consist of benefits paid and changes in future policy benefits liabilities. Benefits for universal life and investment-type products primarily consist of interest credited to policy account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy account balances except for certain contracts for which the fair value option was elected, for which benefits represent the entire change in fair value (including derivative gains and losses on related economic hedges).
    Interest credited to policyholder account balances:
    Represents interest on account-value-based policyholder deposits consisting of amounts credited on non-equity-indexed account values, accretion to the host contract for equity indexed products, and net amortization of sales inducements.
    Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs:
    Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs represents amortization of short-duration and long-duration deferred policy acquisition costs:
 - 
    Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months.
Short-duration policies:
 - 
    Policy acquisition costs for participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, over the premium paying period. Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life, and investment-type products (investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts.
Long-duration policies:
    Aircraft leasing expenses:
    Aircraft leasing expenses consist of depreciation expense, impairment charges, fair value adjustments and lease-related charges on aircraft as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses incurred by ILFC.
    Net (gain) loss on sale of properties and divested businesses:
    Includes gains or losses from the sales of businesses that do not qualify as discontinued operations and sales of previously occupied properties.
    (b) Held-for-sale and discontinued operations:
    AIG reports a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan, the business is available for immediate sale, the business is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the ensuing year and certain other specified criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, a loss is recognized. Depreciation is not recorded on assets of a business classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and major classes are separately disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements commencing in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.
    AIG reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if the business is classified as held for sale, the operations and cash flows of the business have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing
72            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
operations of AIG as a result of a disposal transaction and AIG will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transaction. The results of discontinued operations are reported in Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the business meets the criteria of a discontinued operation, and include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.
    (c) Investments:
    Fixed maturity and equity securities:
    Bonds held to maturity are carried at amortized cost when AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. When AIG does not have the positive intent to hold bonds until maturity, these securities are classified as available for sale or as trading and are carried at fair value. None of AIG's fixed maturity securities met the criteria for held to maturity classification at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
    Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale or as trading are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from available for sale investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of deferred acquisition costs and deferred income taxes, in Total AIG shareholders' equity. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from fixed maturity and equity securities classified as trading are reflected in Net investment income (for insurance subsidiaries) or Other income (for Direct Investment book). Investments in fixed maturities and equity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.
    Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds classified as available for sale are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated holding periods, until maturity, or call date, if applicable. For investments in certain residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and certain collateralized debt obligations/asset backed securities (CDO/ABS), (collectively, structured securities), recognized yields are updated based on current information regarding the timing and amount of expected undiscounted future cash flows. For high credit-quality structured securities, effective yields are recalculated based on actual payments received and updated prepayment expectations, and the amortized cost is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since acquisition with a corresponding charge or credit to net investment income. For structured securities that are not high credit-quality, effective yields are recalculated and adjusted prospectively based on changes in expected undiscounted future cash flows. For purchased credit impaired (PCI) securities, at acquisition, the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows and the recorded investment in the securities represents the initial accretable yield, which is to be accreted into net investment income over the securities' remaining lives on a level-yield basis. Subsequently, effective yields recognized on PCI securities are recalculated and adjusted prospectively to reflect changes in the contractual benchmark interest rates on variable rate securities and any significant increases in undiscounted expected future cash flows arising due to reasons other than interest rate changes.
    Trading securities include the investment portfolio of the Direct Investment book and the Maiden Lane Interests. Trading securities for the Direct Investment book are held to meet short-term investment objectives and to economically hedge other securities.
    For discussion of AIG's other-than-temporary impairment policy, see Note 7 herein.
    Mortgage and other loans receivable  net:
    Mortgage and other loans receivable include commercial mortgages, life insurance policy loans, commercial loans, other loans and notes receivable. Commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances less credit allowances and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount or premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned.
AIG Form 8-K            73
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Direct costs of originating commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related receivables. The amount deferred is amortized to income as an adjustment to earnings using the interest method.
    Mortgage and other loans receivable are considered impaired when collection of all amounts due under contractual terms is not probable. Interest income on such impaired loans is recognized as cash is received. For a discussion of the allowance for credit losses on mortgages and other loans receivable, see Note 8 herein.
    Mortgage and other loans receivable also include life insurance policy loans, which are carried at unpaid principal amount. There is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.
    Flight equipment primarily under operating leases  net:
    Flight equipment is stated at cost (adjusted for any impairment charges), net of accumulated depreciation. Major additions, modifications and interest on deposits during the construction phase are capitalized. Normal maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease are generally provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is reimbursed for certain costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent rentals paid to ILFC by the lessee. ILFC recognizes overhaul rentals received as revenue, net of estimated overhaul reimbursements. Any lessor maintenance contribution made by ILFC in conjunction with a lease of a used aircraft and in excess of overhaul rentals received from the lessee, is capitalized as lease incentives and amortized into lease revenue over the life of the lease. Maintenance performed by ILFC in the event of a repossession of an aircraft is capitalized to the extent the costs meet the recognition criteria for an asset. Depreciation of aircraft is generally computed on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 25 years to a residual value of approximately 15 percent of the cost of the asset.
    Aircraft in the fleet are evaluated for impairment annually during the third quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These evaluations for impairment are significantly affected by estimates of future net cash flows and other factors that involve uncertainty. There are a number of factors and circumstances that can influence (and increase) the potential for recognizing an impairment loss. A firm commitment to sell aircraft may result in aircraft being reclassified from held for use to held for sale for financial reporting purposes and would require an impairment assessment based on the aircraft's fair value. An increase in the likelihood of a sale transaction being completed could result in a similar impairment assessment if the probability of an aircraft sale becomes high enough to reduce the probability weighted expected undiscounted future cash flows to be realized from the aircraft to an amount that is less than its carrying value. In addition, changes in portfolio strategies, changes in demand for a particular aircraft type and changes in economic and market circumstances, including risk factors affecting the airline industry, can affect the impairment assessment.
    When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and the difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain in Other income.
    Other invested assets:
    Other invested assets consist primarily of investments by AIG's insurance operations in hedge funds, private equity funds, other investment partnerships and direct private equity investments. AIG's investments in life settlement contracts and its 33 percent interest in AIA are also included in Other invested assets.
    Hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment partnerships in which AIG's insurance operations hold in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are reported at fair value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). With respect to hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest or
74            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
less than a five percent interest but in which AIG has more than a minor influence over the operations of the investee, AIG's carrying value is its share of the net asset value of the funds or the partnerships. The changes in such net asset values, accounted for under the equity method, are recorded in Net investment income. Direct private equity investments entered into for strategic purposes and not solely for capital appreciation or for income generation are also accounted for under the equity method.
    In applying the equity method of accounting, AIG consistently uses the most recently available financial information provided by the general partner or manager of each of these investments, which is one to three months prior to the end of AIG's reporting period. The financial statements of these investees are generally audited annually.
    Life settlement contracts are accounted for under the investment method. Under the investment method, AIG recognizes its initial investment in life settlement contracts at the transaction price plus all initial direct external costs. Continuing costs to keep the policy in force, primarily life insurance premiums, increase the carrying value of the investment. AIG recognizes income on individual life settlement contracts when the insured dies, at an amount equal to the excess of the contract proceeds over the carrying amount of the contract at that time. Contracts are reviewed for indications that the expected future proceeds from the contract would not be sufficient to recover AIG's estimated future carrying amount of the contract, which is the current carrying amount for the contract plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and other capitalizable future costs. Any such contracts identified are written down to their estimated fair value.
    AIG accounts for its investment in AIA under the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in Net investment income. See Note 7 herein for further information.
    Also included in Other invested assets are real estate held for investment and aircraft asset investments held by non-Aircraft Leasing subsidiaries. See Note 7 herein for further information.
    Short-term investments:
    Short-term investments consist of interest-bearing cash equivalents, time deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and investments, such as commercial paper, with original maturities within one year from the date of purchase.
    Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) generally are accounted for as collateralized lending transactions. These agreements are recorded at their contracted resale amounts plus accrued interest, other than those that are accounted for at fair value. Such agreements entered into by AIGFP are carried at fair value based on market observable interest rates. AIG's policy is to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The value of reverse repurchase agreements that were accounted for as collateralized lending transactions was $7.0 billion at December 31, 2011. The fair value of securities collateral received by AIG was $6.8 billion at December 31, 2011, of which $122 million was repledged by AIG.
    AIG minimizes the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with AIG when necessary.
    (d) Cash:
    Cash represents cash on hand and non-interest bearing demand deposits.
    (e) Premiums and other receivables  net:
    Premiums and other receivables includes premium balances receivable, amounts due from agents and brokers and insureds, trade receivables for Direct Investment book and Global Capital Markets and other receivables. Trade receivables for Global Capital Markets include cash collateral posted to derivative counterparties that are not eligible to be netted against derivative liabilities. The allowance for doubtful accounts on premiums and other receivables was $484 million and $515 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

    (f) Reinsurance assets  net:
    In the ordinary course of business, AIG uses both treaty and facultative reinsurance to minimize its net loss exposure to any single catastrophic loss event or to an accumulation of losses from a number of smaller events. AIG determines the portion of the incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss that will be recoverable under its reinsurance contracts by reference to the terms of the reinsurance protection purchased. This determination is necessarily based on the estimate of IBNR and accordingly, is subject to the same uncertainties as the estimate of IBNR. Reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of AIG's reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses and benefits and loss expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized. AIG remains liable to the extent that its reinsurers do not meet their obligation under the reinsurance contracts, and as such, AIG regularly evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance assets was $365 million and $492 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
    (g) Deferred policy acquisition costs:
    Policy acquisition costs represent those costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of insurance contracts.
    AIG defers incremental costs that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition or renewal of an insurance contract. Such costs generally include agent or broker commissions and bonuses, premium taxes, and medical and inspection fees that would not have been incurred if the insurance contract had not been acquired or renewed. Each cost is analyzed to assess whether it is fully deferrable. AIG partially defers costs, including certain commissions, when it does not believe the entire cost is directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts.
    AIG also defers that portion of employee total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing specific acquisition or renewal activities, including costs associated with the time spent on underwriting, policy issuance and processing, and sales force contract selling. The amounts deferred are derived based on successful efforts for each distribution channel and/or cost center from which the cost originates. Advertising costs related to the issuance of insurance contracts that meet the direct-advertising criteria are deferred and amortized as part of the deferred policy acquisition costs.
    Short-duration insurance contracts:
    Policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. AIG assesses the recoverability of its DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income on in-force business to the sum of expected claims, claims adjustment expenses, unamortized DAC and maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge.
    Long-duration insurance contracts:
    Policy acquisition costs for participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, over the premium paying period. Policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life, and investment-type products (investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits are composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains and losses.

American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    AIG uses a "reversion to the mean" methodology, which allows AIG to maintain its long-term assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of deviations from these assumptions occurring in the current period. A DAC unlocking is performed when management determines that key assumptions (e.g. market return, surrender rates, etc.) should be modified. The DAC asset is recalculated using the new assumptions. The use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry; however, the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary within the industry. If estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC is recalculated using the new assumptions. Any resulting adjustment is included in income as an adjustment to DAC. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the current and projected future profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.
    The DAC for investment-oriented products is also adjusted for changes in estimated gross profits that result from changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale. Because fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to DAC equal to the change in DAC amortization that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields. For long-duration traditional business, if such reinvestment would not be sufficient to recover DAC and meet policyholder obligations an adjustment to DAC and additional future policy benefits for those products is recorded using current best estimates that incorporate a review of assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns. The change in these adjustments, net of tax, is included with the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments that is credited or charged directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of acquisition and is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with DAC. This value is based on the present value of future pre-tax profits discounted at yields applicable at the time of purchase. For participating life, traditional life and accident and health insurance products, VOBA is amortized over the life of the business similar to that for DAC based on the assumptions at purchase. For universal life, and investment-oriented products, VOBA is amortized in relation to the estimated gross profits to date for each period.
    For contracts accounted for at fair value, policy acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and not deferred or amortized.
    See (v) Recent Accounting Standards  Accounting Standards Retrospectively Adopted herein for changes related to deferred acquisition costs due to the adoption of a new accounting standard that addresses the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts.
    (h) Derivative assets and derivative liabilities, at fair value:
    Interest rate, currency, equity and commodity swaps, credit contracts (including AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio), swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as derivatives recorded on a trade-date basis, and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income, when appropriate. In certain instances, a contract's transaction price is the best indication of initial fair value. Aggregate asset or liability positions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet only to the extent permitted by qualifying master netting arrangements in place with each respective counterparty. Cash collateral posted by AIG with counterparties in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative liability, while cash collateral received by AIG in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative asset.
    (i) Other assets:
    Other assets consists of, prepaid expenses, including sales inducement assets, deposits, other deferred charges, real estate, other fixed assets, capitalized software costs, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, restricted cash, including net cash proceeds from the AIA initial public offering in 2010 and, at December 31, 2010, net cash proceeds from the ALICO sale held in escrow pending the Closing and a prepaid

commitment fee asset related to the FRBNY Credit Agreement. The prepaid commitment fee asset related to the FRBNY Credit Agreement was amortized as interest expense ratably over the five-year term of the agreement, accelerated for actual pay-downs that reduce the total credit available. The remaining unamortized prepaid commitment fee asset of $3.6 billion at December 31, 2010 was derecognized by AIG through earnings upon the closing of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011.
    AIG offers sales inducements, which include enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders (bonus interest) on certain annuity and investment contract products. Sales inducements provided to the contractholder are recognized as part of the liability for policyholders' contract deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Such amounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. To qualify for such accounting treatment, the bonus interest must be explicitly identified in the contract at inception, and AIG must demonstrate that such amounts are incremental to amounts AIG credits on similar contracts without bonus interest, and are higher than the contract's expected ongoing crediting rates for periods after the bonus period. The deferred bonus interest and other deferred sales inducement assets totaled $803 million and $915 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The amortization expense associated with these assets is reported within Policyholder benefits and claims incurred and Interest credited to policyholder account balances in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Such amortization expense totaled $239 million, $146 million and $123 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    All commodities are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option contracts. Lower of cost or fair value reductions in commodity positions and unrealized gains and losses in related derivatives are reflected in Other income.
    See Note 12 herein for a discussion of derivatives.
    The cost of buildings and furniture and equipment is depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. AIG periodically assesses the carrying value of its real estate for purposes of determining any asset impairment. Capitalized software costs, which represent costs directly related to obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software, are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a period generally not exceeding five years. Real estate, fixed assets and other long-lived assets are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators exist. Accumulated depreciation on real estate and other fixed assets was $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
    (j) Goodwill:
    Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Substantially all of AIG's goodwill is associated with and allocated to its Chartis segment at December 31, 2011.
    The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured (if any) and recorded. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level.
    Management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of AIG's reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit's fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market-based earnings multiples of the unit's peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. Management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test.
78            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit's assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination. An impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess. Chartis manages its assets on an aggregate basis and does not allocate its assets, other than goodwill, between its operating segments. Therefore, the carrying value of the reporting units was determined by allocating the carrying value of Chartis to those units based upon an internal model.
    During the third quarter of 2011, Chartis finalized its reorganization, operating design and related segment reporting changes. In connection with this reorganization, total goodwill of $1.4 billion was allocated between Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance based on their relative fair values as of September 30, 2011. Management tested the allocated goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair values of the Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance reporting units exceeded their carrying values at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011 and therefore the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired.
    During 2010, AIG had performed goodwill impairment tests at March 31, June 30 and September 30, in connection with the announced sales of ALICO, AIG Star and AIG Edison and again at December 31, 2010.
    During 2010, AIG determined that the fair value of ALICO was less than its carrying value. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, AIG determined that all of the goodwill allocated to ALICO should be impaired and, accordingly, recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $3.3 billion.
    In connection with the announced sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison (the Reporting Unit) in 2010 and management's determination that the Reporting Unit met the held-for-sale criteria, management tested the $1.3 billion of goodwill of the Reporting Unit for impairment. AIG estimated the fair value of the Reporting Unit based on the consideration to be received pursuant to the agreement with Prudential Financial Inc. and determined the fair value to be less than its carrying value. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, AIG determined that all of the goodwill allocated to the Reporting Unit should be impaired and, accordingly, recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2010.
    At December 31, 2010, AIG performed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the goodwill impairment test, AIG concluded that the remaining goodwill was not impaired.

The following table presents the changes in goodwill by reportable segment:
(a)
Includes foreign exchange translation and purchase price adjustments (PPA).
(b)
Reflects the deconsolidation of AIA.
    (k) Separate accounts:
    Separate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk. Each account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at fair value. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to the account assets.
    (l) Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense:
    The liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense represents the accumulation of estimates for unpaid reported losses and includes provisions for IBNR losses. Because the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves are reviewed and updated periodically. If the estimate of reserves is determined to be inadequate or redundant, the increase or decrease is reflected in income. AIG discounts its loss reserves relating to workers' compensation business written by its U.S. domiciled subsidiaries as permitted by the domiciliary statutory regulatory authorities.
    (m) Future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholder contract deposits:
    The liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits are established using assumptions described in Note 13 herein. Future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts include provisions for future dividends to participating policyholders, accrued in accordance with all applicable regulatory or contractual provisions. Also included in Future policy benefits are liabilities for annuities issued in structured settlement arrangements whereby a claimant has agreed to settle a general insurance claim in exchange for fixed payments over a fixed determinable period of time with a life contingency feature. Structured

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
settlement liabilities are presented on a discounted basis because the settled claims are fixed and determinable. Policyholder contract deposits also include AIG's liability for (a) certain guarantee benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, (b) annuities issued in a structured settlement arrangement with no life contingency and (c) certain contracts AIG elected to account for at fair value.
    See Note 6 herein for additional fair value information.
    (n) Other policyholder funds:
    Other policyholder funds are reported at cost and include any policyholder funds on deposit that encompass premium deposits and similar items.
    (o) Income taxes:
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements. AIG assesses its ability to realize deferred tax assets considering all available evidence, including the earnings history, the timing, character and amount of future earnings potential, the reversal of taxable temporary differences and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies available to the legal entities when recognizing deferred tax assets. See Note 22 herein for a further discussion of income taxes.
    (p) Other liabilities:
    Other liabilities consist of other funds on deposit, other payables, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased. AIG has entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in its Chartis segment, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. Accordingly, the premiums received on such contracts, after deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits within Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate Net investment income. As amounts are paid, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit liability is reduced. Also included in Other liabilities are trade payables for the Direct Investment book and AIGFP, which include option premiums received and payables to counterparties that relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards, and options and balances due to clearing brokers and exchanges. Trade payables for Global Capital Markets include cash collateral received from derivative counterparties that is not contractually nettable against derivative assets.
    Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Fair values of securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices. Fair values of spot commodities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices of reference spot futures contracts traded on exchanges.
    Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities (repurchase agreements) (other than those entered into by AIGFP) are generally treated as collateralized borrowing transactions and are recorded at their contracted repurchase amounts plus accrued interest. Agreements to repurchase securities entered into by AIGFP are carried at fair value based on market-observable interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of repurchase agreements accounted for as collateralized borrowing transactions was $563 million.
    When AIG does not obtain cash proceeds sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing identical replacement securities during the term of the contract (generally less than 90 percent of the security value), AIG accounts for the transaction as a sale of the security and reports the obligation to repurchase the security as a derivative contract that is recognized at fair value through earnings. When securities carried in the available for sale category are sold, AIG records a gain or loss in income. When securities accounted for at fair value are considered sold, no additional gain or loss is recognized.
    The fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
    As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of collateral posted by AIG for repurchase agreements totaled $2.8 billion, of which $2.7 billion could be repledged or resold by the counterparties. The market value of securities to be repurchased is monitored, and additional collateral is posted where appropriate.

    Also included in Other liabilities are obligations under gold leases, which are accounted for as a debt host with an embedded gold derivative which are accounted for under the fair value option.
    (q) Other long-term debt:
    AIG's funding consists, in part, of medium and long-term debt. Long-term debt is carried at the principal amount borrowed, net of unamortized discounts or premiums. See Note 15 herein for additional information. Long-term debt also includes liabilities connected to trust preferred stock principally related to outstanding securities issued by SunAmerica Financial Group, Inc. (SAFG, Inc.), a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG (formerly AIG Life Holdings, Inc.). Cash distributions on such preferred stock are accounted for as interest expense.
    (r) Contingent liabilities:
    Amounts are accrued for the resolution of claims that have either been asserted or are deemed probable of assertion if, in the opinion of management, it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. In many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until years after the contingency arises, in which case, no accrual is made until that time. See Note 16 herein for additional information.
    (s) Foreign currency:
    Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any related taxes, in Total AIG shareholders' equity. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Financial statement accounts expressed in currencies other than the functional currency of a consolidated entity are translated into that entity's functional currency. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates during the period. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in income.
    (t) Noncontrolling interests:
    
Nonvoting, callable, junior preferred interests held by Department of the Treasury and Nonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests held by the FRBNY:
    Represent preferred interests in (i) at December 31, 2011, a wholly-owned SPV initially formed to hold the common stock of AIA and (ii) at December 31, 2010, two wholly-owned SPVs initially formed to hold common stock of AIA and ALICO at December 31, 2010. The preferred interests were measured at fair value on their issuance date. AIG transferred the preferred interests in the SPVs to the FRBNY in consideration for a $25 billion reduction of the FRBNY Credit Facility. The preferred interests initially had a liquidation preference of $25 billion and had a preferred return of five percent per year compounded quarterly through September 22, 2013 and nine percent thereafter. The preferred return is reflected in Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests  Nonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The difference between the preferred interests' fair value and the initial liquidation preference is being amortized and included in Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests  Nonvoting, callable, junior and senior preferred interests. These noncontrolling interests, other than the senior preferred interests in the ALICO SPV, which were redeemed in full, were transferred to the Department of the Treasury as part of the January 14, 2011 Recapitalization transactions.
    Other noncontrolling interests:
    Includes the equity interests of third-party shareholders in AIG's consolidated subsidiaries and includes the preferred shareholders' equity in outstanding preferred stock of ILFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. Cash distributions on such preferred stock or equity interests are accounted for as interest expense. This preferred stock consists of 1,000 shares of market auction preferred stock (MAPS) in two series (Series A and B) of 500 shares each. Each of the MAPS shares has a liquidation value of $100,000 per

share and is not convertible. The dividend rate, other than the initial rate, for each dividend period for each series is reset approximately every seven weeks (49 days) on the basis of orders placed in an auction, provided such auctions are able to occur. At December 31, 2011, there is no ability to conduct such auctions; therefore, the MAPS certificate of determination dictates that a maximum applicable rate, as defined in the certificate of determination, be paid on the MAPS. At December 31, 2011, the dividend rate for each of the Series A and Series B MAPS was 0.25 percent and 0.88 percent respectively.
    (u) Earnings (loss) per share:
    Basic earnings or loss per share and diluted loss per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings per share is based on those shares used in basic earnings per share plus shares that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding, adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits.
    See Note 17 herein for additional earnings (loss) per share disclosures.
    (v) Recent accounting standards:
Accounting Standards Retrospectively Adopted
Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts
    In October 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The standard clarifies how to determine whether the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred policy acquisition costs. AIG adopted the standard retrospectively on January 1, 2012.
    The adoption of the standard resulted in a reduction to beginning of period retained earnings for the earliest period presented and a decrease in the amount of capitalized costs in connection with the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts. Accordingly, AIG revised its historical financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements for the changes in deferred policy acquisition costs and associated changes in acquisition expenses and income taxes for affected entities and segments, including divested entities presented in continuing and discontinued operations.
The following tables present the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, showing the amounts previously reported, the effect of the change due to the retrospective adoption of the standard, and the adjusted amounts that are reflected in AIG's consolidated financial statements:

AIG believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy, as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid. This is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented. Because AIG historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short-duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income, there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle.
Presentation of Comprehensive Income
    In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires the presentation of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components, followed consecutively by a second statement that presents total other comprehensive income and its components. This presentation is effective January 1, 2012 and is required to be applied retrospectively. AIG adopted this standard

on January 1, 2012 and included the Condensed Consolidating Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Note 24 herein.
Future Application of Accounting Standards
Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements
    In April 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the criteria used to determine effective control for repurchase agreements and other similar arrangements such as securities lending transactions. The standard modifies the criteria for determining when these transactions would be accounted for as secured borrowings (i.e., financings) instead of sales of the securities.
    The standard removes from the assessment of effective control the requirement that the transferor have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee. The removal of this requirement makes the level of collateral received by the transferor in a repurchase agreement or similar arrangement irrelevant in determining whether the transaction should be accounted for as a sale. Consequently, more repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and similar arrangements will be accounted for as secured borrowings.
    The guidance in the standard must be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after January 1, 2012. Early adoption is prohibited. Under this standard, which AIG adopted on January 1, 2012, $2.1 billion in repurchase agreements will continue to be accounted for as sales unless modifications of these transactions occur subsequent to adoption, which would result in an assessment of whether they should be accounted for as secured borrowings under the standard.
Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure Requirements in GAAP and IFRS
    In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends certain aspects of the fair value measurement guidance in GAAP, primarily to achieve the FASB's objective of a converged definition of fair value and substantially converged measurement and disclosure guidance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Consequently, when the standard becomes effective on January 1, 2012, fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under GAAP and IFRS will be consistent, with certain exceptions including the accounting for day one gains and losses, measuring the fair value of alternative investments using net asset value and certain disclosure requirements.
    The standard's fair value guidance applies to all companies that measure assets, liabilities, or instruments classified in shareholders' equity at fair value or provide fair value disclosures for items not recorded at fair value. While many of the amendments are not expected to significantly affect current practice, the guidance clarifies how a principal market is determined, addresses the fair value measurement of financial instruments with offsetting market or counterparty credit risks and the concept of valuation premise (i.e., in-use or in exchange) and highest and best use, extends the prohibition on blockage factors to all three levels of the fair value hierarchy, and requires additional disclosures.
    The standard is effective for AIG for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2012. The new disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively. The standard will not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Testing Goodwill for Impairment
    In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the approach to testing goodwill for impairment. The standard simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative,
88            AIG Form 8-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
two-step goodwill impairment test. The standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. AIG plans to adopt the standard in conjunction with its goodwill impairment testing performed in 2012. The adoption of the standard is not expected to affect AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Accounting Standards Adopted During 2011
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
    In January 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires fair value disclosures about significant transfers between Level 1 and 2 measurement categories and separate presentation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the rollforward of Level 3 activity. Also, this fair value guidance clarifies the disclosure requirements about the level of disaggregation and valuation techniques and inputs. This guidance became effective for AIG beginning on January 1, 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the rollforward of Level 3 activity, which became effective for AIG beginning on January 1, 2011. See Note 6 herein.
Consolidation of Investments in Separate Accounts
    In April 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard that clarifies that an insurance company should not combine any investments held in separate account interests with its interest in the same investment held in its general account when assessing the investment for consolidation. Separate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk. The standard also provides guidance on how an insurer should consolidate an investment fund when the insurer concludes that consolidation of an investment is required and the insurer's interest is through its general account in addition to any separate accounts. The standard became effective for AIG on January 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring
    In April 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the guidance for a creditor's evaluation of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring and requires additional disclosures about a creditor's troubled debt restructuring activities. The standard clarifies the existing guidance on the two criteria used by creditors to determine whether a modification or restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring: (i) whether the creditor has granted a concession and (ii) whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. The standard became effective for AIG for interim and annual periods beginning on July 1, 2011. AIG applied the guidance in the accounting standard retrospectively for all modifications and restructuring activities that had occurred since January 1, 2011. For receivables that were considered impaired under the guidance, AIG was required to measure the impairment of those receivables prospectively in the first period of adoption. In addition, AIG must provide the disclosures about troubled debt restructuring activities in the period of adoption. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 8 herein.
Accounting Standards Adopted During 2010
Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets
    In June 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard addressing transfers of financial assets that removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and removes the exception that exempted transferors from applying the consolidation rules to QSPEs.
AIG Form 8-K            89
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on January 1, 2010 for AIG. Earlier application was prohibited. The adoption of this standard increased both assets and liabilities by approximately $1.3 billion as a result of consolidating two previously unconsolidated QSPEs. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
    In June 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the guidance addressing consolidation of certain variable interest entities with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance and has (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. The standard also requires enhanced financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities.
The following table summarizes the two methods applied by AIG and the amount and classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the assets and liabilities consolidated as a result of the adoption of the standard on January 1, 2010:
    The cumulative effect adjustment of electing the fair value option was not material to AIG's accumulated deficit.
The following table summarizes the excess of amounts previously recorded upon the consolidation of previously unconsolidated VIEs, as a result of the adoption of the standard on January 1, 2010:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    In February 2010, the FASB also issued an update to the aforementioned accounting standard that defers the revised consolidation rules for variable interest entities with attributes of, or similar to, an investment company or money market fund. The primary effect of this deferral for AIG is that AIG will continue to apply the consolidation rules in effect before the amended guidance discussed above for its interests in eligible entities, such as certain mutual funds.
Accounting for Embedded Credit Derivatives
    In March 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amends the accounting for embedded credit derivative features in structured securities that redistribute credit risk in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another. The standard clarifies how to determine whether embedded credit derivative features, including those in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), credit-linked notes (CLNs), synthetic CDOs and CLNs and other synthetic securities (e.g., commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by securitization entities that wrote credit derivatives), are considered to be embedded derivatives that should be analyzed for potential bifurcation and separate accounting or, alternatively, for fair value accounting in connection with the application of the fair value option to the entire hybrid instrument. AIG adopted the standard on July 1, 2010 and recorded a reclassification of $256 million of synthetic securities from Bonds available for sale to Bond trading securities and also reclassified a gain of $68 million from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Accumulated deficit as of July 1, 2010. Upon adoption, AIG accounts for its investments in synthetic securities otherwise requiring bifurcation at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Disclosure about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables
    In July 2010, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires enhanced disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables that are not measured at fair value. This guidance requires a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses. In addition, this guidance requires disclosure of credit quality indicators, past due information, and modifications of financing receivables. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period became effective for interim and annual reporting periods ended on or after December 15, 2010. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. In January 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that temporarily deferred the effective date for disclosures on modifications of financing receivables by creditors. In April 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that amended the guidance for a creditor's evaluation of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring. In addition, this guidance requires additional disclosures about a creditor's troubled debt restructuring activities in interim and annual periods beginning on July 1, 2011. See Accounting Standards Adopted During 2011 herein for further discussion.
Accounting Standards Adopted During 2009
Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock
    In June 2008, the FASB issued an accounting standard that addresses how to determine whether a financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to an entity's own stock and therefore may not be accounted for as a derivative instrument. AIG adopted the standard on January 1, 2009, which resulted in a $15 million cumulative effect adjustment to opening Accumulated deficit and a $91 million reduction in Additional paid-in capital.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
    In April 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires a company to recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security in earnings and the non-credit component in accumulated other comprehensive income when the company does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. The standard also changed the threshold for determining when an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on a fixed maturity security with respect to intent and ability to hold until recovery. The standard does not change the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment for equity securities. The standard requires additional disclosures in interim and annual reporting periods for fixed maturity and equity securities. See Note 7 herein for the expanded disclosures.
    AIG adopted the standard on April 1, 2009 and recorded an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to increase AIG shareholders' equity by $2.5 billion as of April 1, 2009, consisting of a decrease in Accumulated deficit of $11.8 billion and an increase to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $9.3 billion, net of tax. The net increase in AIG's shareholders' equity was due to a reversal of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for certain previous non-credit impairment charges directly attributable to the change in accounting principle (see Note 22 herein). The cumulative effect adjustment resulted in an increase of approximately $16 billion in the amortized cost of fixed maturity securities, which has the effect of significantly reducing the accretion of investment income over the remaining life of the underlying securities, beginning in the second quarter of 2009. The effect of the reduced investment income will be offset, in part, by a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and sales inducements assets (SIA).
    The standard reduced the level of other-than-temporary impairment charges recorded in earnings for fixed maturity securities due to the following required changes in AIG's accounting policy for other-than-temporary impairments (see Note 7 herein for a more detailed discussion of the changes in policy):
 - 
Impairment charges for non-credit (e.g., severity) losses are no longer recognized;
 - 
The amortized cost basis of credit impaired securities will be written down through a charge to earnings to the present value of expected cash flows, rather than to fair value; and
 - 
For fixed maturity securities that are not deemed to be credit-impaired, AIG is no longer required to assert that it has the intent and ability to hold such securities to recovery to avoid an other-than-temporary impairment charge. Instead, an impairment charge through earnings is required only when AIG has the intent to sell the fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell the security prior to recovery.
 - 
The retrospective adoption of the standard for acquisition costs on January 1, 2012 required an adjustment to the cumulative effect on DAC, SIA and other insurance balances.

The following table presents the components of the change in AIG shareholders' equity at April 1, 2009 due to the adoption of the accounting standard for other-than-temporary impairments and the effect on related DAC, SIA and other insurance balances due to the adoption of the standard for acquisitions costs:
Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly
    In April 2009 the FASB issued an accounting standard that provides guidance for estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The adoption of the standard on April 1, 2009, did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value
    In August 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard to clarify how the fair value measurement principles should be applied to measuring liabilities carried at fair value. The standard explains how to prioritize market inputs in measuring liabilities at fair value and what adjustments to market inputs are appropriate for debt obligations that are restricted from being transferred to another obligor. The standard was effective beginning October 1, 2009 for AIG. The adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)
    In September 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard that permits, as a practical expedient, a company to measure the fair value of an investment that is within the scope of the standard on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment (or its equivalent) if that value is calculated in accordance with fair value as defined by the FASB. The standard also requires enhanced disclosures. The standard applies to investment companies that do not have readily determinable fair values such as certain hedge funds and private equity funds. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods ended after December 15, 2009. The adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 6 herein for disclosure.
3. SEGMENT INFORMATION
    AIG reports the results of its operations through three reportable segments: Chartis, SunAmerica Financial Group (SunAmerica) and Aircraft Leasing. AIG evaluates performance based on pre-tax income (loss), excluding
AIG Form 8-K            93

results from discontinued operations and net (gains) losses on sales of divested businesses, because AIG believes this provides more meaningful information on how its operations are performing.
 - 
In order to align financial reporting with changes made during 2011 and 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the businesses to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated, the following changes were made to AIG's segment information:
 - 
During the third quarter of 2011, Chartis completed the previously-announced reorganization of its operations and now presents its financial information in two operating segments  Commercial Insurance and Consumer Insurance, as well as a Chartis Other operations category. Prior to the third quarter of 2011, Chartis presented its financial information in two operating segments, Chartis U.S. and Chartis International.
 - 
Aircraft Leasing is now presented as a standalone reportable segment. It was previously reported as a component of the Financial Services reportable segment.
 - 
The derivatives portfolio of AIGFP, previously reported as Capital Markets, a component of the Financial Services reportable segment, is now reported with AIG Markets, Inc. (AIG Markets) as Global Capital Markets in AIG's Other operations.
 - 
Chartis financial information has been revised to reflect the classification of certain Chartis products from the Commercial Insurance operating segment to the Consumer Insurance operating segment. This change aligns the financial reporting with the changes made during 2012 to the manner in which AIG's chief operating decision makers review the Chartis segment in order to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. These revisions did not affect the total Chartis reportable segment results previously reported.
    Prior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for the above segment changes.
    The reportable segments and their respective operations are as follows:
    Chartis:
    AIG's property and casualty operations are conducted through multiple-line companies writing substantially all commercial and consumer lines both domestically and abroad. Chartis offers its products through a diverse, multi-channel distribution network that includes agents, wholesalers, global and local brokers, and direct-to-consumer platforms. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, Chartis includes the results of Fuji Fire & Marine Insurance Company Limited (Fuji), which writes primarily consumer lines in Japan. See Note 5 herein.
    SunAmerica:
    SunAmerica offers a comprehensive suite of products and services to individuals and groups, including term life insurance, universal life insurance, accident and health (A&H) insurance, fixed and variable deferred annuities, fixed payout annuities, mutual funds and financial planning.

4. DIVESTED BUSINESSES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND HELD-FOR-SALE CLASSIFICATION
DIVESTED BUSINESSES
AIA Initial Public Offering
    During the second quarter of 2010, AIG and Prudential plc terminated the AIA purchase agreement they had entered in March 2010 and in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, Prudential plc paid AIG a termination fee of $228 million, which is included in Net (gain) loss on sale of properties and divested businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    On October 29, 2010, AIG completed an IPO of 8.08 billion ordinary shares of AIA for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $20.5 billion. Upon completion of the IPO, AIG owned 33 percent of AIA's outstanding shares. Accordingly, AIG deconsolidated AIA and recorded a pre-tax gain of $18.1 billion in 2010. Under the terms of an agreement with the underwriters, AIG is precluded from selling or hedging more than one-half of its remaining shares of AIA until April 18, 2012. Based on AIG's continuing involvement as a result of its 33 percent ownership and board representation, AIA is not being presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2011 and 2010. AIG accounts for its investment in AIA under the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in Net investment income. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of AIG's retained interest in AIA was approximately $12.4 billion and approximately $11.1 billion, respectively, and is included in Other invested assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ALICO Sale
    On March 7, 2010, AIG and the ALICO SPV entered into a definitive agreement with MetLife for the sale of ALICO by the ALICO SPV to MetLife, and the sale of Delaware American Life Insurance Company by AIG to MetLife, for consideration then valued at approximately $15.5 billion, consisting of $6.8 billion in cash and the remainder in equity securities of MetLife, subject to closing adjustments. The ALICO sale closed on November 1, 2010. AIG does not have any significant continuing involvement with or significant continuing cash flows from ALICO. The fair value of the consideration at closing was approximately $16.2 billion. At December 31, 2010, a total of $6.5 billion was included in common and preferred stock trading.
    On the closing date, as consideration for the ALICO sale, the ALICO SPV received net cash consideration of $7.2 billion (which included an upward price adjustment of approximately $400 million pursuant to the terms of the ALICO stock purchase agreement), 78,239,712 shares of MetLife common stock, 6,857,000 shares of newly issued MetLife participating preferred stock convertible into 68,570,000 shares of MetLife common stock upon the approval of MetLife shareholders and 40,000,000 equity units of MetLife with an aggregate stated value of $3.2 billion. AIG recorded a pre-tax gain of $7.9 billion on the transaction in 2010.
    As part of the Recapitalization, AIG used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the ALICO sale to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests.
AGF Sale
    On August 10, 2010, AIG entered into a definitive agreement to sell an 80 percent economic interest (84 percent voting interest) in American General Finance, Inc. (AGF) for $125 million. The AGF sale closed on November 30, 2010. AIG's voting ownership interest in AGF was reduced to approximately 16 percent, and AIG does not otherwise have significant continuing involvement with or significant continuing cash flows from AGF. AIG is carrying its retained investment in AGF of approximately $30 million as a cost method investment in Other invested assets. As a result of this transaction, AIG recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.7 billion in 2010.
    The components of the $1.7 billion charge consisted of the difference between (i) the sum of the fair value of the agreed consideration and AIG's retained 20 percent economic interest and (ii) the net book value of the assets. Prior to the agreed sale, AGF's business and underlying assets were subject to periodic impairment assessments under a held-for-use model and did not meet the criteria for held-for-sale accounting. The large majority of AGF's assets were consumer finance and mortgage loans held for investment and thus were not carried at fair value.
AIG Star and AIG Edison Sale
    On September 30, 2010, AIG entered into a definitive agreement with Prudential Financial, Inc. for the sale of its Japan-based insurance subsidiaries, AIG Star and AIG Edison, for total consideration of $4.8 billion, including the assumption of certain outstanding debt totaling $0.6 billion owed by AIG Star and AIG Edison. The transaction closed on February 1, 2011 and AIG recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.5 billion on the sale that is reflected in Income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In connection with the sale, AIG recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2010.
Nan Shan Sale
    On January 12, 2011, AIG entered into an agreement to sell its 97.57 percent interest in Nan Shan to a Taiwan-based consortium. The transaction was consummated on August 18, 2011 for net proceeds of $2.15 billion in cash. AIG recorded a pre-tax loss of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 largely offsetting Nan Shan operating results for the period, which is reflected in Income (loss) from discontinued operations in the

Consolidated Statement of Operations. The net proceeds from the transaction were used to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests.
    See Note 16 herein for a discussion of guarantees and indemnifications associated with sales of businesses.
    ALICO, Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison previously were components of the Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services reportable segment and AGF previously was a component of the Financial Services reportable segment. Results from discontinued operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009 include the results of Nan Shan, AIG Star and AIG Edison through the date of disposition. Results from discontinued operations for 2010 and 2009 also include the results of ALICO and AGF, which were sold during 2010. The results also include adjustments for guarantees and indemnifications related to these sold businesses.
    Certain other sales completed during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not classified as discontinued operations because AIG continued to generate significant direct revenue-producing or cost-generating cash flows from the businesses or because associated assets, liabilities and results of operations were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to AIG's consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The following table summarizes income (loss) from discontinued operations:
*
In 2010, includes goodwill impairment charges of $3.3 billion related to the sale of ALICO and $1.3 billion related to the sale of AIG Star and AIG Edison. See Note 2(j)  Goodwill herein for further discussion.
Interest Expense Allocation
    Interest expense allocated to discontinued operations gives effect to the provisions of the Recapitalization discussed in Note 1 for all periods presented. For this reason, an interest allocation to discontinued operations related to a portion of the ALICO and all the AGF proceeds was required.
    The interest expense allocated to discontinued operations was based on the anticipated net proceeds that would be applied toward the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility from the sales of ALICO and AGF multiplied by the daily interest rate on the FRBNY Credit Facility for each respective period. The periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee allocated to discontinued operations was determined based on the ratio of funds committed to repay the FRBNY Credit Facility to the total amount of credit available under the FRBNY Credit Facility.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Prior to the Recapitalization, the terms of the FRBNY Credit Facility contractually required net proceeds from dispositions, after taxes and transaction expenses, to the extent such proceeds did not represent capital of AIG's insurance subsidiaries required for regulatory or ratings purposes, to be applied toward the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility as mandatory prepayments unless otherwise agreed with the FRBNY. Mandatory prepayments reduced the amount available to be borrowed under the FRBNY Credit Facility by the amount of the prepayment. In conjunction with anticipated prepayments, AIG allocated interest expense, including periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset, to Income (loss) from discontinued operations. As a result of the revised terms for repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, interest expense that was previously allocated to discontinued operations in connection with the sales of AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan was reclassified to continuing operations for all periods presented.
HELD-FOR-SALE CLASSIFICATION
    At December 31, 2011, AIG had completed the sales of its remaining assets and liabilities that had been classified as held-for-sale. At December 31, 2010, held-for-sale assets and liabilities consisted of Nan Shan, AIG Star, and AIG Edison, and aircraft that remained to be sold by ILFC under agreements for sale.
The following table summarizes the components of assets and liabilities held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010:

5. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
    On March 31, 2010, AIG, through a Chartis subsidiary, purchased additional voting shares in Fuji, a publicly traded Japanese insurance company with property/casualty insurance operations and a life insurance subsidiary. The acquisition of the additional voting shares for $145 million increased Chartis' total voting ownership interest in Fuji from 41.7 percent to 54.8 percent, which resulted in Chartis obtaining control of Fuji. In connection with the acquisition, AIG recognized a bargain purchase gain of $332 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. The bargain purchase gain was primarily attributable to the
102            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
depressed market value of Fuji's common stock, which AIG believes was the result of macroeconomic, capital market and regulatory factors in Japan coupled with Fuji's financial condition and results of operations. The acquisition was consistent with Chartis' desire to increase its share in the substantial Japanese insurance market and to achieve cost savings from synergies.
    In March 2011, Chartis completed the acquisition of approximately 305 million shares of Fuji tendered in response to a public offer at an offer price of 146 Yen per share ($1.76 per share) for a purchase price of $538 million. In August 2011, Chartis acquired the remaining outstanding voting shares of Fuji. As a result of these actions, Chartis now owns 100 percent of Fuji.
    The 2011 purchases were accounted for as equity transactions because AIG previously consolidated Fuji due to its controlling interest. Accordingly, the difference between the fair value of the total consideration paid of $560 million and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest acquired of $489 million was recognized as a reduction of AIG's equity. There was no gain or loss recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.
    On October 7, 2011, AIG through ILFC acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of AeroTurbine for an aggregate cash purchase price of $228 million. AeroTurbine is a provider of certified aircraft engines, aircraft and engine parts and supply chain solutions. This acquisition is expected to further maximize the value of ILFC's aircraft by providing ILFC with in-house part-out and engine leasing capabilities. The acquisition was recorded as a business combination and is not significant to AIG's Consolidated Financial Statements.
6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS
    AIG carries certain of its financial instruments at fair value. AIG defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. AIG maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, liquidity and general market conditions.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
    Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are measured and classified for disclosure purposes in accordance with a fair value hierarchy established in U.S. GAAP. The hierarchy consists of three "levels" based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair values as discussed below:
 - 
Level 1:
    Fair value measurements that are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that AIG has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. Market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. AIG does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 include certain government and agency securities, actively traded listed common stocks and futures and options contracts, most separate account assets and most mutual funds.
AIG Form 8-K            103
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
Level 2:
    Fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 generally include certain government and agency securities, most investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, certain residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), certain commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and certain collateralized debt obligations/asset backed securities (CDO/ABS), certain listed equities, state, municipal and provincial obligations, hybrid securities, certain securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell (repurchase), certain mutual fund and hedge fund investments, certain interest rate, currency and commodity derivative contracts, guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) for the Direct Investment book and other long-term debt.
 - 
Level 3:
    Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Therefore, AIG must make certain assumptions as to the inputs a hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment. In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 include certain RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS, certain corporate debt securities, certain municipal and sovereign debt securities, certain derivative contracts (including the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio), certain hedge fund investments, private equity and real estate fund investments, direct private equity investments and policyholder contract deposits carried at fair value. AIG's non-financial instrument assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis generally are classified as Level 3.
    The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels noted above, and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability.
VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE
Incorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements
 - 
AIG's Own Credit Risk.
    Fair value measurements for certain Direct Investment book debt, GIAs, structured note liabilities and freestanding derivatives, as well as AIGFP derivatives, incorporate AIG's own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to AIG at the balance sheet date by reference to observable AIG CDS or cash bond spreads. A derivative counterparty's net credit exposure to AIG is determined based on master netting agreements, when applicable, which take into consideration all derivative positions with AIG, as well as collateral posted by AIG with the counterparty at the balance sheet date.
    Fair value measurements for embedded policy derivatives and policyholder contract deposits take into consideration that policyholder liabilities are senior in priority to general creditors of AIG and therefore are much less sensitive to changes in AIG credit default swap or cash issuance spreads.
104            AIG Form 8-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
Counterparty Credit Risk.
    Fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for AIG to protect against its net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty CDS spreads, when available. When not available, other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads will be used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads. AIG's net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements, which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty, as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date.
    A CDS is a derivative contract that allows the transfer of third-party credit risk from one party to the other. The buyer of the CDS pays an upfront and/or periodic premium to the seller. The seller's payment obligation is triggered by the occurrence of a credit event under a specified reference security and is determined by the loss on that specified reference security. The present value of the amount of the upfront and/or periodic premium therefore represents a market-based expectation of the likelihood that the specified reference party will fail to perform on the reference obligation, a key market observable indicator of non-performance risk (the CDS spread).
    Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk. Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information.
    The cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name CDS spreads for each specific counterparty, the mid market value of the net exposure (reflecting the amount of protection required) and the weighted average life of the net exposure. CDS spreads are provided to AIG by an independent third party. AIG utilizes an interest rate based on the benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) curve to derive its discount rates.
    While this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs, AIG believes this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities, including consideration of the impact of non-performance risk.
Fixed Maturity Securities  Trading and Available for Sale
    Whenever available, AIG obtains quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity securities at fair value in its trading and available for sale portfolios. Market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets.
    Management is responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions. AIG employs independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information in order to derive fair value estimates for individual investments, based upon market-accepted methodologies and assumptions. The methodologies used by these independent third-party valuation services are reviewed and understood by AIG management, via periodic discussion with and information provided by the valuation services. In addition, as discussed further below, control processes are applied to the fair values received from third-party valuation services to ensure the accuracy of these values.
    Valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of widely accepted valuation methodologies, which may utilize matrix pricing, financial models, accompanying model inputs and various assumptions, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from completed transactions for identical securities and transactions for comparable securities, benchmark yields, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, currency rates, quoted prices for similar securities and other market-observable information, as applicable. If fair value is determined using financial models, these models generally take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued, including its term, interest rate,
AIG Form 8-K            105
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other security or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.
    AIG has control processes designed to ensure that the fair values received from third party valuation services are accurately recorded, that their data inputs and valuation techniques are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions used appear reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. AIG assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques, and has procedures to escalate related questions internally and to the third party valuation services for resolution. In order to assess the degree of pricing consensus among various valuation services for specific asset types, AIG has conducted comparisons of prices received from available sources. Management has used these comparisons to establish a hierarchy for the fair values received from third party valuation services to be used for particular security classes. AIG also validates prices for selected securities through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.
    When AIG's third-party valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a price quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing widely accepted valuation models. Fair values provided by brokers are subject to similar control processes to those noted above for fair values from third party valuation services, including management reviews. Fair values determined internally are also subject to management review in order to ensure that valuation models and related inputs are reasonable.
    The methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities; following are discussions of certain procedures unique to specific classes of securities.
Fixed Maturity Securities issued by Government Entities
    For most debt securities issued by government entities, AIG obtains fair value information from independent third-party valuation service providers, as quoted prices in active markets are generally only available for limited debt securities issued by government entities. The fair values received from these valuation service providers may be based on a market approach using matrix pricing, which considers a security's relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or alternatively based on an income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows to a single present value amount.
Fixed Maturity Securities issued by Corporate Entities
    For most debt securities issued by corporate entities, AIG obtains fair value information from independent third-party valuation service providers. For certain corporate debt securities, AIG obtains fair value information from brokers. For those corporate debt instruments (for example, private placements) that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and non-transferability, and such adjustments generally are based on available market evidence. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using discount rates based on credit spreads, yields or price levels of publicly-traded debt of the issuer or other comparable securities, adjusted for illiquidity and structure.
RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and other ABS
    Independent third-party valuation service providers also provide fair value information for the majority of AIG investments in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and other ABS. Where pricing is not available from valuation service providers, AIG obtains fair value information from brokers. Broker prices may be based on an income approach,
106            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
which converts expected future cash flows to a single present value amount, with specific consideration of inputs relevant to structured securities, including ratings, collateral types, geographic concentrations, underlying loan vintages, loan delinquencies, and weighted average coupons and maturities. Broker prices may also be based on a market approach that considers recent transactions involving identical or similar securities. When the volume or level of market activity for an investment in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs or other ABS is limited, certain inputs used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market.
Maiden Lane Interests
    At their inception, AIG's interests in ML II and ML III were valued and recorded at the transaction prices of $1 billion and $5 billion, respectively.
    Subsequently, AIG's interest in ML III has been valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that (i) uses the estimated future cash flows and the fair value of the ML III assets, (ii) allocates the estimated future cash flows according to the ML III waterfall, and (iii) determines the discount rate to be applied to AIG's interest in ML III by reference to the discount rate implied by the estimated value of ML III assets and the estimated future cash flows of AIG's interest in the capital structure. Estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated, to the extent possible, using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools, structure and terms.
    The fair value methodology used since inception and prior to March 31, 2011 for AIG's interest in ML II had used the same discounted cash flow methodology as for ML III. As a result of the announcement on March 31, 2011 by the FRBNY of its plan to begin selling the assets in the ML II portfolio over time through a competitive sales process, AIG modified its methodology for estimating the fair value of its interest in ML II to incorporate the assumption of a current liquidation, which (i) uses the estimated fair value of the ML II assets and (ii) allocates the estimated asset fair value according to the ML II waterfall.
    AIG does not believe a change in the fair value methodology used for its interest in ML III is appropriate at this time based on current available information. Other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported.
    Adjustments to the fair value of AIG's interest in ML II are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in Net investment income for SunAmerica's domestic life insurance companies. Adjustments to the fair value of AIG's interest in ML III are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in Net investment income for AIG's Other operations.
    AIG expects to receive repayment of its initial investment as well as incremental undiscounted cash flows and accrued interest on the Maiden Lane Interests after repayment of the first priority obligations owed to the FRBNY. On February 8, 2012, the FRBNY announced that the proceeds from the most recent sale of ML II assets would enable the repayment of the entire remaining outstanding balance of the senior loan from the FRBNY to ML II. AIG therefore, expects to begin receiving repayment of its $1 billion initial investment in ML II, plus accrued interest, commencing in 2012. Any proceeds in excess of AIG's principal and interest will be allocated five-sixths to the FRBNY and one-sixth to AIG. Under the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement dated December 8, 2010, among AIG Parent, AM Holdings LLC (formerly known as ALICO Holdings LLC), AIA Aurora LLC, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury, and the Trust, all payments received by AIG from ML II will be required to be used to pay down the liquidation preference of the AIA SPV Preferred Interests. The fair value of AIG's interest in ML II is most affected by the liquidation proceeds realized by the FRBNY from the sale of the collateral securities. A 10 percent change in the liquidation proceeds realized by the FRBNY would result in a change of approximately $152 million in the fair value of the ML II interest. The fair value of AIG's interest in ML III is most affected by changes in the discount rates and changes in the estimated future collateral cash flows used in the valuation. Changes in estimated future cash flows for ML III would be the
AIG Form 8-K            107
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
result of changes in interest rates and their effect on the underlying floating rate securities as well as expectations of defaults, recoveries and prepayments on underlying loans.
    The LIBOR interest rate curve changes are determined based on observable prices, interpolated or extrapolated to derive a LIBOR for a specific maturity term as necessary. The spreads over LIBOR for the Maiden Lane Interests (including collateral-specific credit and liquidity spreads) can change as a result of changes in market expectations about the future performance of these investments as well as changes in the risk premium that market participants would demand at the time of the transactions.
Changes in the discount rate or the estimated future cash flows used in the valuation would alter AIG's estimate of the fair value of AIG's interest in ML III as shown in the table below.
    If the FRBNY were to announce a plan to liquidate the assets of ML III at their estimated fair values, similar to their disclosed plan for ML II, the impact of the change in AIG's assumptions would be an increase in the fair value of AIG's interest in ML III by approximately $685 million at December 31, 2011.
    AIG believes that the ranges of discount rates used in these analyses are reasonable on the basis of implied spread volatilities of similar collateral securities. The ranges of estimated future cash flows were determined on the basis of historical variability in the estimated cash flows. Because of these factors, the fair values of the Maiden Lane Interests are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the amounts estimated.
Equity Securities Traded in Active Markets  Trading and Available for Sale
    Whenever available, AIG obtains quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure at fair value marketable equity securities in its trading and available for sale portfolios or in Other invested assets. Market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets.
Mortgage and Other Loans Receivable
    AIG estimates the fair value of mortgage and other loans receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotations, discounted cash flow analyses and/or internal valuation models. The determination of fair value considers inputs such as interest rate, maturity, the borrower's creditworthiness, collateral, subordination, guarantees, past-due status, yield curves, credit curves, prepayment rates, market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors.
Other Invested Assets
    AIG initially estimates the fair value of investments in certain hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment partnerships by reference to the transaction price. Subsequently, AIG generally obtains the fair value
108            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which are generally audited annually. AIG considers observable market data and performs certain control procedures to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement. The fair values of other investments carried at fair value, such as direct private equity holdings, are initially determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such as market transactions in similar instruments and other financing transactions of the issuer, with adjustments made to reflect illiquidity as appropriate.
Short-term Investments
    For short-term investments that are measured at fair value, the carrying values of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk.
Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell
    Securities purchased under agreements to resell are generally treated as collateralized receivables. AIG reports certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell in Short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. AIG uses market-observable interest rates for receivables measured at fair value. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors.
Separate Account Assets
    Separate account assets are composed primarily of registered and unregistered open-end mutual funds that generally trade daily and are measured at fair value in the manner discussed above for equity securities traded in active markets.
Freestanding Derivatives
    Derivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). AIG generally values exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.
    OTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. AIG generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.
    Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. When AIG does not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. AIG will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, third party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Embedded Policy Derivatives
    Certain variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts contain embedded policy derivatives that AIG bifurcates from the host contracts and accounts for separately at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. AIG concluded these contracts contain (i) written option guarantees on minimum accumulation value, (ii) a series of written options that guarantee withdrawals from the highest anniversary value within a specific period or for life, or (iii) equity-indexed written options that meet the criteria of derivatives that must be bifurcated.
    The fair value of embedded policy derivatives contained in certain variable annuity and equity-indexed annuity and life contracts is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. These cash flow estimates primarily include benefits and related fees assessed, when applicable, and incorporate expectations about policyholder behavior. Estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on AIG's historical experience.
    With respect to embedded policy derivatives in AIG's variable annuity contracts, because of the dynamic and complex nature of the expected cash flows, risk neutral valuations are used. Estimating the underlying cash flows for these products involves many estimates and judgments, including those regarding expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market index returns to funds, fund performance, discount rates and policyholder behavior. With respect to embedded policy derivatives in AIG's equity-indexed annuity and life contracts, option pricing models are used to estimate fair value, taking into account assumptions for future equity index growth rates, volatility of the equity index, future interest rates, and determinations on adjusting the participation rate and the cap on equity-indexed credited rates in light of market conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions. These methodologies incorporate an explicit risk margin to take into consideration market participant estimates of projected cash flows and policyholder behavior.
    AIG also incorporates its own risk of non-performance in the valuation of the embedded policy derivatives associated with variable annuity and equity- indexed annuity and life contracts. Historically, the expected cash flows were discounted using the interest rate swap curve (swap curve), which is commonly viewed as being consistent with the credit spreads for highly-rated financial institutions (S&P AA-rated or above). A swap curve shows the fixed-rate leg of a non-complex swap against the floating rate (e.g. LIBOR) leg of a related tenor. The swap curve was adjusted, as necessary, for anomalies between the swap curve and the U.S. Treasury yield curve. During the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG revised the non-performance risk adjustment to reflect a market participant's view of SunAmerica's claims paying ability. As a result, in 2010, AIG incorporated an additional spread to the swap curve used to value embedded policy derivatives, thereby reducing the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities by $336 million, which is partially offset by $173 million of DAC amortization.
AIGFP's Super Senior Credit Default Swap Portfolio
    Included in Global Capital Markets is the remaining derivatives portfolio of AIGFP. AIG values AIGFP's CDS transactions written on the super senior risk layers of designated pools of debt securities or loans using internal valuation models, third-party price estimates and market indices. The principal market was determined to be the market in which super senior credit default swaps of this type and size would be transacted, or have been transacted, with the greatest volume or level of activity. AIG has determined that the principal market participants, therefore, would consist of other large financial institutions who participate in sophisticated over-the-counter derivatives markets. The specific valuation methodologies vary based on the nature of the referenced obligations and availability of market prices.
    The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. These market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes. Further, disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile
110            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
markets have increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values.
    AIG's valuation methodologies for the super senior credit default swap portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. AIG has sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.
    Regulatory capital portfolio:
    In the case of credit default swaps written to facilitate regulatory capital relief, AIG estimates the fair value of these derivatives by considering observable market transactions. The transactions with the most observability are the early terminations of these transactions by counterparties. AIG continues to reassess the expected maturity of the portfolio. AIGFP has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital CDSs initiated by counterparties. However, during the second quarter of 2011, AIGFP terminated mezzanine tranches related to certain terminated super senior regulatory capital trades and made payments which approximated their fair values at the time of termination.
    The regulatory benefit of these transactions for AIGFP's financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the capital regulations promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, known as Basel I. In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finalized a new framework for international capital and liquidity standards known as Basel III, which, when fully implemented, may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties and thus may impact the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions. In assessing the fair value of the regulatory capital CDS transactions, AIG also considers other market data, to the extent relevant and available. For further discussion, see Note 12 herein.
    Multi-sector CDO portfolios:
    AIG uses a modified version of the Binomial Expansion Technique (BET) model to value AIGFP's credit default swap portfolio written on super senior tranches of multi-sector CDOs of ABS. The BET model was developed in 1996 by a major rating agency to generate expected loss estimates for CDO tranches and derive a credit rating for those tranches, and remains widely used.
    AIG has adapted the BET model to estimate the price of the super senior risk layer or tranche of the CDO. AIG modified the BET model to imply default probabilities from market prices for the underlying securities and not from rating agency assumptions. To generate the estimate, the model uses the price estimates for the securities comprising the portfolio of a CDO as an input and converts those estimates to credit spreads over current LIBOR-based interest rates. These credit spreads are used to determine implied probabilities of default and expected losses on the underlying securities. This data is then aggregated and used to estimate the expected cash flows of the super senior tranche of the CDO.
    Prices for the individual securities held by a CDO are obtained in most cases from the CDO collateral managers, to the extent available. CDO collateral managers provided market prices for 61.7 percent of the underlying securities used in the valuation at December 31, 2011. When a price for an individual security is not provided by a CDO collateral manager, AIG derives the price through a pricing matrix using prices from CDO collateral managers for similar securities. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the relationship of the security to other benchmark quoted securities. Substantially all of the CDO collateral managers who provided prices used dealer prices for all or part of the underlying securities, in some cases supplemented by third-party pricing services.
    The BET model also uses diversity scores, weighted average lives, recovery rates and discount rates. AIG employs a Monte Carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on the valuation of the CDO of the unique aspects of the CDO's structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior part of the capital structure. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine whether an underlying security defaults in a given simulation scenario and, if it does, the security's implied random default time and expected loss. This information is used to project cash flow streams and to determine the expected losses of the portfolio.
    In addition to calculating an estimate of the fair value of the super senior CDO security referenced in the credit default swaps using its internal model, AIG also considers the price estimates for the super senior CDO securities

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
provided by third parties, including counterparties to these transactions, to validate the results of the model and to determine the best available estimate of fair value. In determining the fair value of the super senior CDO security referenced in the credit default swaps, AIG uses a consistent process that considers all available pricing data points and eliminates the use of outlying data points. When pricing data points are within a reasonable range an averaging technique is applied.
    Corporate debt/Collateralized loan obligation (CLO) portfolios:
    In the case of credit default swaps written on portfolios of investment-grade corporate debt, AIG uses a mathematical model that produces results that are closely aligned with prices received from third parties. This methodology is widely used by other market participants and uses the current market credit spreads of the names in the portfolios along with the base correlations implied by the current market prices of comparable tranches of the relevant market traded credit indices as inputs. Given its unique attributes, one transaction, which had represented two percent of the total notional amount of the corporate debt portfolio as of the second quarter of 2011, was valued using third-party quotations. This transaction matured in the third quarter of 2011.
    AIG estimates the fair value of its obligations resulting from credit default swaps written on CLOs to be equivalent to the par value less the current market value of the referenced obligation. Accordingly, the value is determined by obtaining third-party quotations on the underlying super senior tranches referenced under the credit default swap contract.
Policyholder Contract Deposits
    Policyholder contract deposits accounted for at fair value are measured using an earnings approach by taking into consideration the following factors:
 - 
Current policyholder account values and related surrender charges;
 - 
The present value of estimated future cash inflows (policy fees) and outflows (benefits and maintenance expenses) associated with the product using risk neutral valuations, incorporating expectations about policyholder behavior, market returns and other factors; and
 - 
A risk margin that market participants would require for a market return and the uncertainty inherent in the model inputs.
    The change in fair value of these policyholder contract deposits is recorded as Policyholder benefits and claims incurred in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Other Long-Term Debt
    When fair value accounting has been elected, the fair value of non-structured liabilities is generally determined by using market prices from exchange or dealer markets, when available, or discounting expected cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity. Such instruments are generally classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as substantially all inputs are readily observable. AIG determines the fair value of structured liabilities and hybrid financial instruments (where performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or currency risks) using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology (described above) given the nature of the embedded risk profile. Such instruments are classified in Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model. In addition, adjustments are made to the valuations of both non-structured and structured liabilities to reflect AIG's own creditworthiness based on observable credit spreads of AIG.
Other Liabilities
    Other liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. AIG estimates the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices. Fair values of spot commodities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices of reference spot futures contracts traded on exchanges.

Transfers of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities
    AIG's policy is to transfer assets and liabilities into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data. This may include circumstances in which market activity has dramatically decreased and transparency to underlying inputs cannot be observed, current prices are not available and substantial price variances in quotations among market participants exist.
    In certain cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. AIG's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment. In making the assessment, AIG considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
    AIG's policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities into or out of Level 3 at their fair values as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of the determination of fair value. As a result, the Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in income or other comprehensive income and as shown in the table above excludes $68 million of net losses related to assets and liabilities transferred into Level 3 during 2011, and includes $45 million of net gains related to assets and liabilities transferred out of Level 3 during 2011.
Transfers of Level 3 Assets
    During the year ended December 31, 2011, transfers into Level 3 included certain RMBS, CMBS, ABS, private placement corporate debt and certain private equity funds and hedge funds. The transfers into Level 3 of investments in certain RMBS, CMBS and certain ABS were due to a decrease in market transparency, downward credit migration and an overall increase in price disparity for certain individual security types. The downward credit migration in part reflected AIG's move to using composite credit ratings for these securities commencing in 2011, in order to reduce reliance on any single rating agency. Transfers into Level 3 for private placement corporate debt and certain other ABS were primarily the result of AIG adjusting matrix pricing information downward to better reflect the additional risk premium associated with those securities that AIG believes was not captured in the matrix. Certain private equity funds and hedge funds were transferred into Level 3 due to these investments being carried at fair value and no longer being accounted for using the equity method of accounting, consistent with the changes to AIG's ownership and lack of ability to exercise significant influence over the respective investments. Other private equity funds and hedge funds transferred into Level 3 represented interests in hedge funds carried at fair value with limited market activity due to fund-imposed redemption restrictions.
    Assets are transferred out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that significant inputs can be corroborated with market observable data. This may be due to a significant increase in market activity for the asset, a specific event, one or more significant input(s) becoming observable or when a long-term interest rate significant to a valuation becomes short-term and thus observable. In addition, transfers out of Level 3 also occur when investments are no longer carried at fair value as the result of a change in the applicable accounting methodology, given changes in the nature and extent of AIG's ownership interest. During the year ended December 31, 2011, transfers out of Level 3 primarily related to investments in private placement corporate debt, investments in certain CMBS and ABS and certain private equity funds and hedge funds. Transfers out of Level 3 for private placement corporate debt and for certain ABS were primarily the result of AIG using observable pricing information or a third party pricing quotation that appropriately reflects the fair value of those securities, without the need for adjustment based on AIG's own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or the current liquidity in the market. Transfers out of Level 3 for certain CMBS and certain other ABS investments were primarily due to increased observations of market transactions and price information for those securities. Certain private equity funds and hedge funds were transferred out of Level 3 due to these investments no longer being carried at fair value, based on AIG's use of the equity method of accounting consistent with the changes to AIG's ownership and ability to exercise significant influence over the respective investments.

Transfers of Level 3 Liabilities
    During the year ended December 31, 2011, there were no significant transfers into Level 3 liabilities. As AIG presents carrying values of its derivative positions on a net basis in the table above, transfers out of Level 3 liabilities, which totaled approximately $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily related to certain derivative assets transferred into Level 3 because of the lack of observable inputs on certain forward commitments. Other transfers out of Level 3 liabilities were due to movement in market variables.
    AIG uses various hedging techniques to manage risks associated with certain positions, including those classified within Level 3. Such techniques may include the purchase or sale of financial instruments that are classified within Level 1 and/or Level 2. As a result, the realized and unrealized gains (losses) for assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 presented in the table above do not reflect the related realized or unrealized gains (losses) on hedging instruments that are classified within Level 1 and/or Level 2.

Includes investments of entities classified as held for sale of $415 million at December 31, 2010.
    At December 31, 2011, private equity fund investments included above are not redeemable during the lives of the funds and have expected remaining lives that extend in some cases more than 10 years. At that date, 32 percent of the total above had expected remaining lives of less than three years, 55 percent between three and seven years and 13 percent between seven and 10 years. Expected lives are based upon legal maturity, which can be extended at the fund manager's discretion, typically in one-year increments.
    At December 31, 2011, hedge fund investments included above are redeemable monthly (9 percent), quarterly (53 percent), semi-annually (10 percent) and annually (28 percent), with redemption notices ranging from 1 day to 180 days. More than 79 percent require redemption notices of less than 90 days. Investments representing approximately 47 percent of the value of the hedge fund investments cannot be redeemed, either in whole or in part, because the investments include various restrictions. The majority of these restrictions were put in place prior to 2009 and do not have stated end dates. The restrictions that have pre-defined end dates are generally expected to be lifted by the end of 2012. The partial restrictions relate to certain hedge funds that hold at least one investment that the fund manager deems to be illiquid. In order to treat investors fairly and to accommodate subsequent subscription and redemption requests, the fund manager isolates these illiquid assets from the rest of the fund until the assets become liquid.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS
    AIG also measures the fair value of certain assets on a non-recurring basis, generally quarterly, annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. These assets include cost and equity-method investments, life settlement contracts, flight equipment primarily under operating leases, collateral securing foreclosed loans and real estate and other fixed assets, goodwill and
122            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
other intangible assets. AIG uses a variety of techniques to measure the fair value of these assets when appropriate, as described below:
 - 
Cost and Equity-Method Investments:
    When AIG determines that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, AIG records the assets at fair value with the loss recognized in earnings. In such cases, AIG measures the fair value of these assets using the techniques discussed above in Valuation Methodologies of Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value  Other Invested Assets.
 - 
Life Settlement Contracts:
    AIG measures the fair value of individual life settlement contracts (which are included in Other invested assets) whenever the carrying value plus the undiscounted future costs that are expected to be incurred to keep the life settlement contract in force exceed the expected proceeds from the contract. In those situations, the fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current life expectancy assumptions. The discount rate incorporates current information about market interest rates, the credit exposure to the insurance company that issued the life settlement contract and AIG's estimate of the risk margin an investor in the contracts would require.
 - 
Flight Equipment Primarily Under Operating Leases:
    AIG evaluates quarterly the need to perform a recoverability assessment of held for use aircraft considering applicable accounting requirements and performs this assessment at least annually for all aircraft in the fleet. When AIG determines that the carrying value of its commercial aircraft may not be recoverable, AIG records the aircraft at fair value with the loss recognized in earnings. The impairment assessment involves a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an aircraft's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If potential impairment is present, undiscounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value and, in the event of a cash flow shortfall, the amount of impairment is measured and recorded. AIG measures the fair value of its commercial aircraft using an income approach based on the present value of all cash flows from existing contractual and projected lease payments for the period extending to the end of the aircraft's economic life in its highest and best use configuration, plus its disposition value based on expectations of a market participant.
 - 
Collateral Securing Foreclosed Loans on Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets:
    When AIG takes collateral in connection with foreclosed loans, AIG generally bases its estimate of fair value on the price that would be received in a current transaction to sell the asset by itself, by reference to observable transactions for similar assets.
 - 
Goodwill:
    AIG tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When AIG determines that goodwill may be impaired, AIG uses techniques including market-based earning multiples of peer companies, discounted expected future cash flows, appraisals, or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value of the reporting unit, if available, to determine the amount of any impairment.
 - 
Long-Lived Assets:
    AIG tests its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. AIG measures the fair value of long-lived assets based on an in-use premise that considers the same factors used to estimate the fair value of its real estate and other fixed assets under an in-use premise.
 - 
Businesses Held for Sale:
    When AIG determines that a business qualifies as held for sale and AIG's carrying amount is greater than the expected sale price less cost to sell, AIG records an impairment loss for the difference.
    See Note 2 herein for additional information about how AIG tests various asset classes for impairment.

    During 2011, 2010 and 2009, AIG recognized gains of $420 million and losses of $779 million and $86 million, respectively, attributable to the observable effect of changes in credit spreads on AIG's own liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. AIG calculates the effect of these credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates, AIG's observable credit spreads on these liabilities and other factors that mitigate the risk of nonperformance such as cash collateral posted.

FAIR VALUE INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE
    Information regarding the estimation of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value (excluding insurance contracts and lease contracts) is discussed below:
 - 
Mortgage and other loans receivable:
    Fair values of loans on real estate and other loans receivable were estimated for disclosure purposes using discounted cash flow calculations based upon discount rates that AIG believes market participants would use in determining the price that they would pay for such assets. For certain loans, AIG's current incremental lending rates for similar type loans is used as the discount rate, as it is believed that this rate approximates the rates that market participants would use. The fair values of policy loans are generally estimated based on unpaid principal amount as of each reporting date or, in some cases, based on the present value of the loans using a discounted cash flow model. No consideration is given to credit risk as policy loans are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policies.
 - 
Other Invested Assets:
    The majority of Other invested assets that are not measured at fair value represent investments in life settlement contracts. The fair value of life settlement contracts included in Other invested assets is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current life expectancy assumptions.
 - 
Cash and short-term investments:
    The carrying values of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk.
 - 
Policyholder contract deposits associated with investment-type contracts:
    Fair values for policyholder contract deposits associated with investment-type contracts not accounted for at fair value were estimated for disclosure purposes using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Where no similar contracts are being offered, the discount rate is the appropriate tenor swap rate (if available) or current risk-free interest rate consistent with the currency in which the cash flows are denominated.
 - 
Long-term debt:
    Fair values of these obligations were determined for disclosure purposes by reference to quoted market prices, where available and appropriate, or discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG's current market-observable implicit-credit-spread rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.

    During 2011, Chartis entered into financing transactions using municipal bonds to support statutory capital by generating taxable income. In these transactions, certain available for sale high grade municipal bonds were loaned to counterparties, primarily commercial banks and brokerage firms, who receive the tax-exempt income from the bonds. In return, the counterparties are required to pay Chartis an income stream equal to the bond coupon of the loaned securities, plus a fee. To secure their borrowing of the securities, counterparties are required to post liquid collateral (such as high quality fixed maturity securities and cash) equal to at least 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities to third-party custodians for Chartis' benefit in the event of default by the counterparties. The collateral is maintained in a third-party custody account and is adjusted daily based on daily fair value measurements from a third-party pricing source. Chartis is not permitted to sell, repledge or otherwise control the collateral unless an event of default by the counterparties occurs. At the termination of these transactions, Chartis and its counterparties are obligated to return the collateral maintained in the third-party custody account and the identical municipal bonds loaned, respectively. These transactions are accounted for as secured financing arrangements. Under these secured financing arrangements, securities available for sale with a fair value of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2011 were loaned to counterparties against collateral equal to at least 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities.

AIG did not recognize the unrealized losses in earnings on these fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2011, because management neither intends to sell the securities nor does it believe that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Furthermore, management expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. In performing this evaluation, management considered the recovery periods for securities in previous periods of broad market declines. For fixed maturity securities with significant declines, management performed fundamental credit analysis on a security-by-security basis, which included consideration of credit enhancements, expected defaults on underlying collateral, review of relevant industry analyst reports and forecasts and other available market data.

Other Invested Assets  Carried at Fair Value
    All of the equity investments carried at fair value are subject to other-than-temporary impairment evaluation (see below for discussion on evaluating equity investments for other-than-temporary impairment). The gross unrealized loss recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income on such investments was $269 million and $60 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, the majority of which pertains to investments in private equity funds and hedge funds that have been in continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.
Other Invested Assets  Equity Method Investments
    At December 31, 2011, AIG had a 33 percent interest in AIA, which AIG is accounting for under the fair value option. AIG's equity method investments include certain investment partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest or in which AIG has more than a minor influence over the operations of the investee, and certain other strategic investments. Dividends received from AIG's other strategic investments were $17 million, $25 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The undistributed earnings of other strategic investments in which AIG's ownership interest is less than 50 percent were $9 million, $8 million and $7 million at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Evaluating Investments for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
    On April 1, 2009, AIG adopted prospectively an accounting standard addressing the evaluation of fixed maturity securities for other-than-temporary impairments. These requirements have significantly altered AIG's policies and procedures for determining impairment charges recognized through earnings. The new standard requires a company to recognize the credit component (a credit impairment) of an other-than-temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security in earnings and the non-credit component in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the company does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. The standard also changes the threshold for determining when an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred on a fixed maturity security with respect to intent and ability to hold the security until recovery and requires additional disclosures. A credit impairment, which is recognized in earnings when it occurs, is the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the estimated present value of cash flows expected to be collected (recovery value), as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not related to a credit impairment is recognized as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). AIG refers to both credit impairments and impairments recognized as a result of intent to sell as "impairment charges." The impairment model for equity securities was not affected by the standard.
Impairment Policy  Effective April 1, 2009 and Thereafter
Fixed Maturity Securities
    If AIG intends to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings.
    For all other fixed maturity securities for which a credit impairment has occurred, the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to earnings. Changes in fair value compared to recovery value, if any, is charged to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity investments on which other-than-temporary credit impairments were taken (a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)).
    When assessing AIG's intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that AIG will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition AIG's investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.

American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    AIG considers severe price declines in its assessment of potential credit impairments. AIG may also modify its modeled outputs for certain securities when it determines that price declines are indicative of factors not comprehended by the cash flow models.
    In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related, AIG generally prospectively accretes into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining expected holding period of the security.
Credit Impairments

(c)

    In assessing whether a credit impairment has occurred for a structured fixed maturity security, AIG performs evaluations of expected future cash flows. Certain critical assumptions are made with respect to the performance of the securities.
    When estimating future cash flows for a structured fixed maturity security (e.g., RMBS, CMBS, CDO, ABS) management considers historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs, which vary by asset class:
 - 
current delinquency rates;
 - 
expected default rates and the timing of such defaults;
AIG Form 8-K            135
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
loss severity and the timing of any recovery; and
 - 
expected prepayment speeds.
    For corporate, municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired, management considers the fair value as the recovery value when available information does not indicate that another value is more relevant or reliable. When management identifies information that supports a recovery value other than the fair value, the determination of a recovery value considers scenarios specific to the issuer and the security, and may be based upon estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings, political and macroeconomic factors, stability and financial strength of the issuer, the value of any secondary sources of repayment and the disposition of assets.
Equity Securities
    The impairment model for equity securities and other cost and equity method investments was not affected by the adoption of the accounting standard related to other-than-temporary impairments in the second quarter of 2009. AIG continues to evaluate its available for sale equity securities, equity method and cost method investments for impairment by considering such securities as candidates for other-than-temporary impairment if they meet any of the following criteria:
 - 
the security has traded at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to cost for an extended period of time (nine consecutive months or longer);
 - 
a discrete credit event has occurred resulting in (i) the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation; (ii) the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court-supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or (iii) the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than the par value of their claims; or
 - 
AIG has concluded that it may not realize a full recovery on its investment, regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events.
    The determination that an equity security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer, its near-term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances. The above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline in which AIG could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary (severity losses).
Other Invested Assets
    AIG's investments in private equity funds and hedge funds are evaluated for impairment similar to the evaluation of equity securities for impairments as discussed above. Such evaluation considers market conditions, events and volatility that may impact the recoverability of the underlying investments within these private equity funds and hedge funds and is based on the nature of the underlying investments and specific inherent risks. Such risks may evolve based on the nature of the underlying investments.
    AIG's investments in life settlement contracts are monitored for impairment based on the underlying life insurance policies, with cash flows reported periodically. An investment in a life settlement contract is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds from the insurance policy are less than the carrying amount of the investment plus anticipated continuing costs. If an impairment loss is recognized, the investment is written down to fair value. During 2011, Chartis implemented an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis. In cases where updated information indicates that an individual's health has improved, an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract. Chartis also revised the valuation table used to estimate
136            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
future net cash flows. This had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts. These changes resulted in an increase in the number of life settlement contracts identified as potentially impaired.
    AIG's aircraft asset investments and investments in real estate are periodically evaluated for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, AIG compares expected investment cash flows to carrying value. When the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value, the investments are written down to fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings.
Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI) Securities
    Beginning the second quarter of 2011, AIG purchased certain RMBS securities that had experienced deterioration in credit quality since their issuance. Management determined, based on its expectations as to the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be received, that it was probable at acquisition that AIG would not collect all contractually required payments, including both principal and interest and considering the effects of prepayments, for these PCI securities. At acquisition, the timing and amount of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be received on each PCI security was determined based on management's best estimate using key assumptions, such as interest rates, default rates and prepayment speeds. At acquisition, the difference between the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the PCI securities and the recorded investment in the securities represents the initial accretable yield, which is to be accreted into net investment income over their remaining lives on a level-yield basis. Additionally, the difference between the contractually required payments on the PCI securities and the undiscounted expected future cash flows represents the non-accretable difference at acquisition. Over time, based on actual payments received and changes in estimates of undiscounted expected future cash flows, the accretable yield and the non-accretable difference can change, as discussed further below.
    On a quarterly basis, the undiscounted expected future cash flows associated with PCI securities are re-evaluated based on updates to key assumptions. Changes to undiscounted expected future cash flows due solely to the changes in the contractual benchmark interest rates on variable rate PCI securities will change the accretable yield prospectively. Declines in undiscounted expected future cash flows due to further credit deterioration as well as changes in the expected timing of the cash flows can result in the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment charge, as PCI securities are subject to AIG's policy for evaluating investments for other-than-temporary impairment. Significant increases in undiscounted expected future cash flows for reasons other than interest rate changes are recognized prospectively as an adjustment to the accretable yield.
The following tables present information on AIG's PCI securities, which are included in bonds available for sale:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
    Mortgage and other loans receivable are considered impaired when collection of all amounts due under contractual terms is not probable. For commercial mortgage loans in particular, the impairment is measured based on the fair value of underlying collateral, which is determined based on the present value of expected net future cash flows of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell. For other loans, the impairment may be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or based on the loan's observable market price, where available. An allowance is typically established for the difference between the impaired value of the loan and its current carrying amount. Additional allowance amounts are established for incurred but not specifically identified impairments, based on the analysis of internal risk ratings and current loan values. Internal risk ratings are assigned based on the consideration of risk factors including past due status, debt service coverage, loan-to-value ratio or the ratio of the loan balance to the estimated value of the property, property occupancy, profile of the borrower and of the major property tenants, economic trends in the market where the property is located, and condition of the property. These factors and the resulting risk ratings also provide a basis for determining the level of monitoring performed at both the individual loan and the portfolio level. When all or a portion of a commercial mortgage loan is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion of the carrying value of the loan is charged off against the allowance.
    A significant majority of commercial mortgage loans in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for AIG to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan.
The following table presents a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for losses on Mortgage and other loans receivable:
(a)
Of the total, $65 million and $476 million relates to individually assessed credit losses on $110 million and $739 million of commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
(b)
Included in Other loans were finance receivables, which were reported net of unearned finance charges, for both investment purposes and held for sale.

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS
    AIG modifies loans to optimize their returns and improve their collectability, among other things. When such a modification is undertaken with a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification involves AIG granting a concession to the troubled debtor, the modification is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). AIG assesses whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty based on a variety of factors, including the borrower's current default on any of its outstanding debt, the probability of a default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification, the insufficiency of the borrower's forecasted cash flows to service any of its outstanding debt (including both principal and interest), and the borrower's inability to access alternative third-party financing at an interest rate that would be reflective of current market conditions for a non-troubled debtor. Concessions granted may include extended maturity dates, interest rate changes, principal forgiveness, payment deferrals and easing of loan covenants.
    As of December 31, 2011, there were no significant loans held by AIG that had been modified in a TDR during 2011.
9. REINSURANCE
    In the ordinary course of business, AIG's general insurance and life insurance companies place reinsurance with other insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification of AIG's business and limit the potential for losses arising from large risks. In addition, AIG's general insurance subsidiaries assume reinsurance from other insurance companies.
The following table provides supplemental information for gross loss and benefit reserves net of ceded reinsurance:

In 2011, the Net of Reinsurance amount reflects the cession under the June 17, 2011 transaction with National Indemnity Company (NICO) of $1.7 billion.
(b)
Represents gross reinsurance assets, excluding allowances and reinsurance recoverable on paid losses.
SHORT-DURATION REINSURANCE
    Short-duration reinsurance is effected under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts that protect AIG against losses above stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are recognized as a reduction of premiums earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on short-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of Reinsurance assets. Assumed reinsurance premiums are earned primarily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the reinsurance contracts. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met, the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both
140            AIG Form 8-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit.
The following table presents short-duration insurance premiums written and earned:

st
    For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses incurred, amounted to $6.1 billion, $8.0 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively.
LONG-DURATION REINSURANCE
    Long-duration reinsurance is effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these treaties are earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection provided. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on long-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying policy benefits and are presented as a component of Reinsurance assets.

    SunAmerica operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management strategies. Pools of highly-rated third-party reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention limits. SunAmerica's domestic long-duration insurance companies also cede excess, non-economic reserves carried on a statutory-basis on certain term and universal life insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to onshore and offshore affiliates.
    SunAmerica generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of its intercompany reinsurance transactions, particularly with respect to redundant statutory reserves requirements on term insurance and universal life with secondary guarantees (XXX and AXXX reserves). For this purpose, SunAmerica has a $585 million syndicated letter of credit facility outstanding at December 31, 2011, all of which relates to long-duration intercompany reinsurance transactions. SunAmerica has also obtained approximately $215 million of letters of credit on a bilateral basis all of which relates to long-duration intercompany reinsurance transactions. All of these approximately $800 million of letters of credit are due to mature on December 31, 2015.
REINSURANCE SECURITY
    AIG's third-party reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both short-duration and long-duration reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any reinsurance agreement. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities, and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in prior recovery efforts.
    AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and AIG's Credit Risk Management department establishes limits per reinsurer. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIG's business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurer.

    Included in the above table is the VOBA, an intangible asset recorded during purchase accounting, which is amortized in a manner similar to DAC. Amortization of VOBA was $34 million, $90 million and $132 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, while the unamortized balance was $430 million, $488 million and $1.6 billion at
AIG Form 8-K            143
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The percentage of the unamortized balance of VOBA at December 31, 2011 expected to be amortized in 2012 through 2016 by year is: 8.1 percent, 7.6 percent, 6.3 percent, 5.8 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, with 67.1 percent being amortized after five years. These projections are based on current estimates for investment, persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions. The DAC amortization charged to income includes the increase or decrease of amortization related to Net realized capital gains (losses), primarily in SunAmerica's domestic retirement services business. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, amortization expense (increased) decreased by $274 million, $114 million and $15 million, respectively.
    As AIG operates in various global markets, the estimated gross profits used to amortize DAC, VOBA and SIA are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period. The combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions.
    DAC, VOBA and SIA for insurance-oriented, investment-oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated, AIG's DAC, VOBA and SIA may be subject to an impairment charge and AIG's results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods.
11. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
    A variable interest entity (VIE) is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights and do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE by its primary beneficiary is not based on majority voting interest, but is based on other criteria discussed below.
    While AIG enters into various arrangements with VIEs in the normal course of business, AIG's involvement with VIEs is primarily via its insurance companies as a passive investor in debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued by VIEs. In all instances, AIG consolidates the VIE when it determines it is the primary beneficiary. This analysis includes a review of the VIE's capital structure, contractual relationships and terms, nature of the VIE's operations and purpose, nature of the VIE's interests issued and AIG's involvements with the entity. When assessing the need to consolidate a VIE, AIG evaluates the design of the VIE as well as the related risks the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holders to.
    For VIEs with attributes consistent with that of an investment company or a money market fund, the primary beneficiary is the party or group of related parties that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the VIE, receives the majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both.
    For all other variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. While also considering these factors, the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of AIG's decision-making ability and its ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE.

EXPOSURE TO LOSS
    AIG's total off-balance sheet exposure associated with VIEs, primarily consisting of financial guarantees and commitments to real estate and investment funds, was $0.4 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The following table presents AIG's total assets, total liabilities and off-balance sheet exposure associated with its variable interests in consolidated VIEs:
*
The assets of each VIE can be used only to settle specific obligations of that VIE.
    AIG calculates its maximum exposure to loss to be (i) the amount invested in the debt or equity of the VIE, (ii) the notional amount of VIE assets or liabilities where AIG has also provided credit protection to the VIE with the VIE as the referenced obligation, and (iii) other commitments and guarantees to the VIE. Interest holders in VIEs sponsored by AIG generally have recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to AIG, except in limited circumstances when AIG has provided a guarantee to the VIE's interest holders.
The following table presents total assets of unconsolidated VIEs in which AIG holds a variable interest, as well as AIG's maximum exposure to loss associated with these VIEs:

BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION
AIG's interests in the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs were classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:
*
Decrease from prior year was due to the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility from the AIA and ALICO SPVs pursuant to the Recapitalization.
    See Note 2(v) herein for the effect of consolidation under the amended accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities.
AIA AND ALICO SPVS
    AIG is the primary beneficiary of the AIA and ALICO SPVs, as AIG has the power to direct the activities of the SPVs that most significantly impact their economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPVs. See Notes 1 and 17 herein for further discussion of the AIA and ALICO SPVs.
REAL ESTATE AND INVESTMENT FUNDS
    AIG, through AIG Global Real Estate, is an investor in various real estate investments, some of which are VIEs. These investments are typically with unaffiliated third-party developers via a partnership or limited liability company structure. The VIE's activities consist of the development or redevelopment of commercial and residential real estate. AIG's involvement varies from being a passive equity investor or finance provider to actively managing the activities of the VIE.
    AIG's insurance operations participate as passive investors in the equity issued primarily by third-party-managed hedge and private equity funds. AIG's insurance operations typically are not involved in the design or establishment of VIEs, nor do they actively participate in the management of VIEs.
COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT
    AIGFP is the primary beneficiary of Curzon Funding LLC, an asset-backed commercial paper conduit, the assets of which serve as collateral for the conduit's obligations.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING PARTNERSHIPS
    SunAmerica Affordable Housing Partners, Inc. (SAAHP) organizes and invests in limited partnerships that develop and operate affordable housing qualifying for federal tax credits, in addition to a few market rate properties across the United States. The general partners in the operating partnerships are almost exclusively unaffiliated third-party developers. AIG does not consolidate an operating partnership if the general partner is an unaffiliated person. Through approximately 1,050 partnerships, SAAHP has investments in developments with approximately 135,000 apartment units nationwide, and as of December 31, 2011 has syndicated approximately $7.7 billion in partnership equity to other investors who will receive, among other benefits, tax credits under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The pre-tax income of SAAHP is reported, along with other SunAmerica partnership income, as a component of the SunAmerica segment.
MAIDEN LANE INTERESTS
    In 2008, certain AIG wholly-owned life insurance companies sold all of their undivided interests in a pool of $39.3 billion face amount of RMBS to ML II, whose sole member is the FRBNY. AIG has a significant variable economic interest in ML II, which is a VIE.
    In 2008, AIG entered into an agreement with the FRBNY, ML III and The Bank of New York Mellon, which established arrangements, through ML III, to fund the purchase of multi-sector CDOs underlying or related to CDS written by AIGFP. Concurrently, AIGFP's counterparties to such CDS transactions agreed to terminate those CDS transactions relating to the multi-sector CDOs purchased from them. AIG has a significant variable interest in ML III, which is a VIE.
OTHER ASSET ACCOUNTS
Aircraft Trusts
    AIG has created two VIEs for the purpose of acquiring, owning, leasing, maintaining, operating and selling aircraft. AIG subsidiaries hold beneficial interests, including all the equity interests in these entities. These beneficial interests include passive investments by AIG's insurance operations in non-voting preferred equity interests and in the majority of the debt issued by these entities. AIG and its subsidiaries collectively maintain the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance, and bear the obligation to absorb economic losses or receive economic benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As a result, AIG has determined that it is the primary beneficiary and fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of these entities, which totaled $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively at December 31, 2011. The debt of these entities is not an obligation of, or guaranteed by, AIG or any of its subsidiaries. Under a servicing agreement, ILFC acts as servicer for the aircraft owned by these entities.
Consumer Loans Vehicles
    AIG sponsors one VIE that has issued a variable funding note backed by a consumer loan collateralized by individual life insurance assets. As of December 31, 2011, total consolidated assets and liabilities for this entity were $456 million and $248 million, respectively; AIG's maximum exposure, representing the carrying value of the consumer loan, was $434 million.
Structured Investment Vehicle
    Through the Direct Investment book, AIG sponsors Nightingale Finance Ltd, a structured investment vehicle (SIV), which invests in variable rate, investment-grade debt securities, the majority of which are ABS. AIG has no equity interest in the SIV; however, it maintains the power to direct the activities of the SIV that most

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
significantly impact the entity's economic performance and bears the obligation to absorb economic losses that could potentially be significant to the SIV. The SIV meets the definition of a VIE and accordingly, AIG, as primary beneficiary, consolidates the assets of the SIV, which totaled over $1 billion as of December 31, 2011 in the Direct Investment book; related liabilities were not significant.
FINANCING VEHICLES
    ILFC has created wholly-owned subsidiaries for the purpose of purchasing aircraft and obtaining financing secured by such aircraft. A portion of the secured debt has been guaranteed by the European Export Credit Agencies. These entities meet the definition of a VIE because they do not have sufficient equity to operate without ILFC's subordinated financial support in the form of intercompany notes which serve as equity. ILFC fully consolidates the entities, controls all the activities of the entities and guarantees the activities of the entities. AIG has not included these entities in the above table as they are wholly-owned and there are no other variable interests other than those of ILFC and the lenders. See Note 15 herein for further information.
LEASING ENTITIES
    ILFC has created wholly-owned subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating aircraft leases with airlines. The entities meet the definition of a VIE because they do not have sufficient equity to operate without ILFC's subordinated financial support in the form of intercompany notes which serve as equity. ILFC fully consolidates the entities, controls all the activities of the entities and fully guarantees the activities of the entities. AIG has not included these entities in the above table as they are wholly owned and there are no other variable interests in the entities other than those of ILFC.
RMBS, CMBS, OTHER ABS AND CDOS
    AIG, through its insurance company subsidiaries, is a passive investor in RMBS, CMBS, other ABS and CDOs primarily issued by domestic special-purpose entities. AIG generally does not sponsor or transfer assets to, or act as the servicer to these asset-backed structures, and was not involved in the design of these entities.
    AIG, through its Direct Investment book, also invests in CDOs and similar structures, which can be cash-based or synthetic and are managed by third parties. The role of Direct Investment book is generally limited to that of a passive investor in structures AIG does not manage.
    AIG's maximum exposure in these types of structures is limited to its investment in securities issued by these entities. Based on the nature of AIG's investments and its passive involvement in these types of structures, AIG has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. AIG has not included these entities in the above table; however, the fair values of AIG's investments in these structures are reported in Notes 6 and 7 herein.
12. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
    AIG uses derivatives and other financial instruments as part of its financial risk management programs and as part of its investment operations. AIGFP had also transacted in derivatives as a dealer and had acted as an intermediary between the relevant AIG subsidiary and the counterparty. In a number of situations, AIG has replaced AIGFP with AIG Markets for purposes of acting as an intermediary between the AIG subsidiary and the third-party counterparty as part of the wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios.
    Derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties with returns linked to or "derived" from some underlying equity, debt, commodity, or other asset, liability, or foreign exchange rate or other index or the occurrence of a specified payment event. Derivatives, with the exception of bifurcated embedded derivatives, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Derivative assets, at fair value and Derivative liabilities, at fair

value. A bifurcated embedded derivative is measured at fair value and accounted for in the same manner as a free standing derivative contract. The corresponding host contract is accounted for according to the accounting guidance applicable for that instrument. A bifurcated embedded derivative is generally presented with the host contract in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 6 herein for additional information on embedded policy derivatives.
The following table presents the notional amounts and fair values of AIG's derivative instruments:
(a)
Notional amount represents a standard of measurement of the volume of derivatives business of AIG. Notional amount is generally not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and is not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Notional amounts generally represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps and certain credit contracts. For credit contracts, notional amounts are net of all underlying subordination.
(b)
Fair value amounts are shown before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral.
(c)
Includes cross currency swaps.
(d)
Notional amount of derivative liabilities and fair value of derivative liabilities include $18,254 million and $918 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011, and $14,107 million and $445 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010, related to bifurcated embedded derivatives. At December 31, 2010, these respective amounts were previously included in Other Contracts.

COLLATERAL
    AIG engages in derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties in most cases under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. Many of the ISDA agreements also include Credit Support Annex (CSA) provisions, which generally provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels. AIG attempts to reduce its risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis. AIG minimizes the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be posted to AIG upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted by AIG upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction. In the case of some of the derivative transactions, as an alternative to posting collateral and subject to certain conditions, AIG may assign the transaction to an obligor with higher debt ratings or arrange for a substitute guarantee of AIG's obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings or take other similar action. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.
    Collateral posted by AIG to third parties for derivative transactions was $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Collateral obtained by AIG from third parties for derivative transactions was $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This collateral can generally be repledged or resold by AIG.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING
    AIG designated certain derivatives entered into by AIG Markets with third parties as cash flow hedges of certain debt issued by ILFC and designated certain derivatives entered into by AIG's insurance subsidiaries with third parties as fair value hedges of available-for-sale investment securities held by such subsidiaries. The fair value hedges include foreign currency forwards designated as hedges of the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated available-for-sale securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. With respect to the cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps were designated as hedges of the changes in cash flows on floating rate debt attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate.
    AIG assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Regression analysis is employed to assess the effectiveness of these hedges both on a prospective and retrospective basis. AIG does not utilize the shortcut method to assess hedge effectiveness. For net investment hedges, a qualitative methodology is utilized to assess hedge effectiveness.
    AIG uses foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments in net investment hedge relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with AIG's non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. AIG assesses the hedge effectiveness and measures the amount of ineffectiveness for these hedge relationships based on changes in spot exchange rates. AIG records the change in the carrying amount of these investments related to the effective portion of the hedge in the foreign currency translation adjustment within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Simultaneously, the ineffective portion, if any, is recorded in earnings. If (i) the notional amount of the hedging debt matches the designated portion of the net investment and (ii) the hedging debt is denominated in the same currency as the functional currency of the hedged net investment, no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, AIG recognized gains (losses) of $(13) million and $28 million, respectively, included in Foreign currency translation adjustment in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the net investment hedge relationships.
The following table presents the effect of AIG's derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships in the Consolidated Statement of Operations:
(a)
Gains and losses recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion and amounts excluded from effectiveness testing are recorded in Net realized capital gains (losses). Includes $27 million for 2010 related to the ineffective portion.
(b)
Includes immaterial amounts related to Foreign exchange contracts.
(c)
Includes $149 million for 2011 and $144 million for 2010, representing the amortization of debt basis adjustment following the discontinuation of hedge accounting recorded in Other income and Net realized capital gains (losses).

AIGFP DERIVATIVES
    AIGFP enters into derivative transactions to mitigate market risk in its exposures (interest rates, currencies, commodities, credit and equities) arising from its transactions. In most cases, AIGFP did not hedge its exposures related to the credit default swaps it had written. As a dealer, AIGFP structured and entered into derivative transactions to meet the needs of counterparties who may have been seeking to hedge certain aspects of such counterparties' operations or obtain a desired financial exposure.
    AIGFP's derivative transactions involving interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. AIGFP typically became a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and, therefore, is exposed to
152            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
counterparty credit risk and may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency, commodity and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but involve the exchange of specific currencies or cash flows based on the underlying commodity, equity securities or indices. Also, they may involve the exchange of notional amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction. Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction.
    AIGFP follows a policy of minimizing interest rate, currency, commodity, and equity risks associated with investment securities by entering into offsetting positions, thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation and depreciation. In addition, to reduce its credit risk, at December 31, 2011, AIGFP has entered into credit derivative transactions with respect to $196 million of securities to economically hedge its credit risk.
    The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to AIGFP's foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements.
    Futures and forward contracts are contracts that obligate the holder to sell or purchase foreign currencies, commodities or financial indices in which the seller/purchaser agrees to make/take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and within, or at, a specified period of time. As a writer of options, AIGFP generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity, currency or index by entering into offsetting transactions with third-party market participants. Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts.
AIGFP Super Senior Credit Default Swaps
    AIGFP entered into credit default swap transactions with the intention of earning revenue on credit exposure. In the majority of AIGFP's credit default swap transactions, AIGFP sold credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. Generally, AIGFP provides such credit protection on a "second loss" basis, meaning that AIGFP would incur credit losses only after a shortfall of principal and/or interest, or other credit events, in respect of the protected loans and debt securities, exceeds a specified threshold amount or level of "first losses."
    Typically, the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities has been tranched into different layers of risk, which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies. At origination, there is usually an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio, and then successive layers ranging generally from a BBB-rated layer to one or more AAA-rated layers. A significant majority of AIGFP transactions that were rated by rating agencies had risk layers or tranches rated AAA at origination that are immediately junior to the threshold level above which AIGFP's payment obligation would generally arise. In transactions that were not rated, AIGFP applied equivalent risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its payment obligations. Therefore, the risk layer assumed by AIGFP with respect to the designated portfolio of loans or debt securities in these transactions is often called the "super senior" risk layer, defined as a layer of credit risk senior to one or more risk layers rated AAA by the credit rating agencies, or, if the transaction is not rated, structured to be the equivalent thereto.

(d)
During 2011, AIGFP terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions, with a combined net notional amount of $24.1 billion, that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute. In addition, AIGFP terminated all of the related mezzanine tranches and hedge transactions related to those mezzanine tranches, with a combined net notional amount of $2.2 billion. The transactions were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair values at the time of termination.
(e)
During 2011, AIGFP liquidated one multi-sector super senior CDS transaction with a net notional amount of $188 million. The primary underlying collateral components, which consisted of individual ABS CDS transactions, were sold in an auction to counterparties, including AIGFP, at their approximate fair value at the time of the liquidation. AIGFP was the winning bidder on approximately $107 million of individual ABS CDS transactions, which are reported in written single name credit default swaps as of December 31, 2011. During 2011, AIGFP also paid $37 million to its counterparties with respect to multi-sector CDOs. Multi-sector CDOs also include $4.6 billion and $5.5 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written with cash settlement provisions at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
(f)
Corporate debt/CLOs include $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in net notional amount of credit default swaps written on the super senior tranches of CLOs at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
(g)
Net of offsetting purchased CDS of $1.4 billion in net notional amount at December 31, 2010. There were no offsetting purchased CDSs at December 31, 2011.
    The expected weighted average maturity of AIGFP's super senior credit derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2011 was 0.72 years for the regulatory capital corporate loan portfolio, 0.41 years for the regulatory capital prime residential mortgage portfolio, 3.78 years for the regulatory capital other portfolio, 6.42 years for the multi-sector CDO arbitrage portfolio and 4.18 years for the corporate debt/CLO portfolio.
154            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Given the current performance of the underlying portfolios, the level of subordination of the credit protection written by AIGFP and AIGFP's own assessment of the credit quality of the underlying portfolio, as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures, AIGFP does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief.
    Because of long-term maturities of the CDS in the arbitrage portfolio, AIG is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made. However, the net notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the super senior credit default swap portfolio.
AIGFP Written Single Name Credit Default Swaps
    AIGFP has also entered into credit default swap contracts referencing single-name exposures written on corporate, index and asset-backed credits, with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure. Some of these transactions were entered into as part of a long-short strategy allowing AIGFP to earn the net spread between CDS it wrote and ones it purchased. At December 31, 2011, the net notional amount of these written CDS contracts was $380 million, including ABS CDS transactions assumed by AIGFP from a liquidated multi-sector super senior CDS transaction. AIGFP has hedged these exposures by purchasing offsetting CDS contracts of $70 million in net notional amount. The net unhedged position of approximately $310 million represents the maximum exposure to loss on these CDS contracts. The average maturity of the written CDS contracts is 19.13 years. At December 31, 2011, the fair value of derivative liability (which represents the carrying value) of the portfolio of CDS was $89 million.
    Upon a triggering event (e.g., a default) with respect to the underlying credit, AIGFP would normally have the option to settle the position through an auction process (cash settlement) or pay the notional amount of the contract to the counterparty in exchange for a bond issued by the underlying credit obligor (physical settlement).
    AIGFP wrote these CDS contracts under ISDA Master Agreements. The majority of these Master Agreements include CSAs that provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels. At December 31, 2011, AIGFP had posted $112 million of collateral under these contracts.
ALL OTHER DERIVATIVES
    AIG's businesses other than AIGFP also use derivatives and other instruments as part of their financial risk management. Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used to manage interest rate risk associated with embedded derivatives contained in insurance contract liabilities, fixed maturity securities, outstanding medium- and long-term notes as well as other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange derivatives (principally foreign exchange forwards and options) are used to economically mitigate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net capital exposures, and foreign currency transactions. Equity derivatives are used to mitigate financial risk embedded in certain insurance liabilities. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures that they are meant to offset.
    In addition to hedging activities, AIG also enters into derivative instruments with respect to investment operations, which include, among other things, credit default swaps and purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity linked notes and convertible bonds.
Matched Investment Program Written Credit Default Swaps
    AIG's MIP operations, which are reported in AIG's Other operations category as part of the Direct Investment book, are currently in run-off. Through the MIP, AIG has entered into CDS contracts as a writer of protection, with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure in an unfunded form. The portfolio of CDS contracts were single-name exposures and, at inception, were predominantly high-grade corporate credits.
AIG Form 8-K            155
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    These contracts were written through AIG Markets, which then transacted directly with unaffiliated third parties under ISDA agreements. As of December 31, 2011, the notional amount of written CDS contracts was $1.1 billion with an average credit rating of BBB+. At that date, the average remaining maturity of the written CDS contracts was less than one year and the fair value of the derivative liability (which represents the carrying value) of the MIP's written CDS contracts was $13 million.
    The majority of the ISDA agreements include CSA provisions, which provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels. At December 31, 2011, $2 million of collateral was posted for CDS contracts related to the MIP. The notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the written CDS contracts. However, because of the average investment grade rating and expected default recovery rates, actual losses are expected to be less.
    Upon a triggering event (e.g., a default) with respect to the underlying credit, AIG Markets would normally have the option to settle the position on behalf of the MIP through an auction process (cash settlement) or pay the notional amount of the contract to the counterparty in exchange for a bond issued by the underlying credit (physical settlement).
Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features
    AIG engages in derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under ISDA agreements. Many of the ISDA agreements also include CSA provisions, which provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels. In addition, AIG attempts to reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis.
    The aggregate fair value of AIG's derivative instruments, including those of AIGFP, that contain credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2011, was approximately $4.9 billion. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral under these contracts at December 31, 2011, was $5.1 billion.
    AIG estimates that at December 31, 2011, based on AIG's outstanding financial derivative transactions, including those of AIGFP at that date, a one-notch downgrade of AIG's long-term senior debt ratings to BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), would permit counterparties to make additional collateral calls and permit the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts, resulting in a negligible amount of corresponding collateral postings and termination payments; a one-notch downgrade to Baa2 by Moody's Investors' Services, Inc. (Moody's) and an additional one-notch downgrade to BBB by S&P would result in approximately $264 million in additional collateral postings and termination payments and a further one-notch downgrade to Baa3 by Moody's and BBB- by S&P would result in approximately $267 million in additional collateral postings and termination payments. Additional collateral postings upon downgrade are estimated based on the factors in the individual collateral posting provisions of the CSA with each counterparty and current exposure as of December 31, 2011. Factors considered in estimating the termination payments upon downgrade include current market conditions, the complexity of the derivative transactions, historical termination experience and other observable market events such as bankruptcy and downgrade events that have occurred at other companies. Management's estimates are also based on the assumption that counterparties will terminate based on their net exposure to AIG. The actual termination payments could significantly differ from management's estimates given market conditions at the time of downgrade and the level of uncertainty in estimating both the number of counterparties who may elect to exercise their right to terminate and the payment that may be triggered in connection with any such exercise.

HYBRID SECURITIES WITH EMBEDDED CREDIT DERIVATIVES
    AIG invests in hybrid securities (such as credit-linked notes). Upon the issuance of credit-linked notes, the cash received by the issuer is generally used to invest in highly rated securities in addition to entering into a derivative contract that exchanges the return on its highly-rated securities for the return on a separate portfolio of assets. The investments owned by the issuer serve as collateral for the derivative instrument written by the issuer. The return on the separate portfolio received by the issuer is used to pay the return owed on the credit-linked notes. These hybrid securities expose AIG to risks similar to the risks in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and ABS, but such risk is derived from the separate portfolio rather than from direct mortgage or loan investments owned by the issuer. As with other investments in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and other ABS, AIG invested in these hybrid securities with the intent of generating income, and not specifically to acquire exposure to embedded derivative risk. Similar to AIG's other investments in RMBS, CMBS, CDOs and ABS, AIG's investments in these hybrid securities are exposed to losses only up to the amount of AIG's initial investment in the hybrid security, as losses on the derivative contract will be paid via the collateral held by the entity that issues the hybrid security. Losses on the embedded derivative contracts may be triggered by events such as bankruptcy, failure to pay or restructuring associated with the obligations referenced by the derivative, and these losses in turn result in the reduction of the principal amount to be repaid to AIG and other investors in the hybrid securities. Other than AIG's initial investment in the hybrid securities, AIG has no further obligation to make payments on the embedded credit derivatives in the related hybrid securities.
    Effective July 1, 2010, AIG elected to account for its investments in these hybrid securities with embedded written credit derivatives at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in Net investment income and Other income. Through June 30, 2010, these hybrid securities had been accounted for as available for sale securities, and had been subject to other-than-temporary impairment accounting as applicable.
    AIG's investments in these hybrid securities are reported as Bond trading securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these hybrid securities was $111 million at December 31, 2011. These securities have a current par amount of $454 million and have remaining stated maturity dates that extend to 2052.

13. LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE AND FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR LIFE AND ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND POLICYHOLDER CONTRACT DEPOSITS
The following table presents the reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense:
(a)
Represents the acquisition of Fuji on March 31, 2010.
(b)
Transatlantic was deconsolidated in 2009, and 21st Century and HSB were sold in 2009.
(c)
Includes amounts related to dispositions through the date of disposition.
(d)
In 2011, includes $(414) million, $145 million and $413 million related to excess casualty, commercial specialty workers' compensation and environmental, respectively. In 2010, includes $1.1 billion, $793 million and $1.5 billion related to excess casualty, excess workers' compensation and asbestos, respectively. In 2009, includes $1.5 billion, $956 million and $151 million related to excess casualty, excess workers' compensation and asbestos, respectively.
    The 2011 net adverse development includes loss-sensitive business, for which AIG also recognized a $172 million loss-sensitive premium adjustment.
    The 2010 net adverse loss development for prior accident years primarily relates to the asbestos, excess casualty, excess workers' compensation and primary workers' compensation. Further, this charge primarily relates to accident years 2007 and prior (accident years before the financial crisis in 2008) and a significant amount relates to accident 2005 and prior (accident years prior to the start of the managed reduction in these long-tail lines of business). The 2009 charge relates to excess casualty, excess workers' compensation and asbestos lines of business.
158            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Further, the charge relates to accident years 2005 and prior (accident years prior to the start of the managed reduction in these long-tail lines of business).
    In 2010 and 2009, the reserve charges were primarily due to long-tail lines of business which have been reduced since 2006. In the case of asbestos, since 1985, standard policies have contained an absolute exclusion for asbestos and pollution-related damages. The factors driving excess casualty loss cost were primarily due to medical inflation and the exhaustion of underlying primary policies for products liability coverage and for homebuilders. In 2010, excess workers' compensation experienced significant prior year development related to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in March 2010 as management concluded that there is increased vulnerability to the risk of further cost-shifting to the excess workers' compensation class of business.
DISCOUNTING OF RESERVES
    At December 31, 2011, net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $3.18 billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations based upon the following assumptions.
 - 
The tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial Mortality Table.
 - 
The non-tabular workers' compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies' own payout patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies.
 - 
Certain asbestos business that was written by Chartis is discounted, when allowed by the regulator and when payments are fixed and determinable, based on the investment yields of the companies and the payout pattern for this business.
    The discount consists of the following: $777 million  tabular discount for workers' compensation in the domestic operations of Chartis and $2.32 billion  non-tabular discount for workers' compensation in the domestic operations of Chartis; and $88 million  non-tabular discount for asbestos for Chartis.
FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS
The following table presents the components of future policy benefits:
    Long duration contract liabilities included in future policy benefits, as presented in the preceding table, result primarily from life products. Short duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health products. The liability for future life policy benefits has been established on the basis of the following assumptions:
 - 
Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which vary by year of issuance and products, range from 1 percent to 9.5 percent within the first 20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of 13.5 percent and grade to not greater than 0.5 percent.
AIG Form 8-K            159
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
Mortality and surrender rates are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy form. The weighted average lapse rate, including surrenders, for individual and group life was approximately 5.3 percent.
 - 
The portions of current and prior Net income and of current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the jurisdictions in which the policies are in force.
 - 
Participating life business represented approximately 2.2 percent of the gross insurance in force at December 31, 2011 and 4.8 percent of gross Premiums and other considerations in 2011. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is approved locally by the boards of directors of the life companies. Provisions for future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction, reflecting local regulations.
POLICYHOLDER CONTRACT DEPOSITS
The following table presents policyholder contract deposits liabilities:
    The liability for policyholder contract deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:
 - 
Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by year of issuance, range from 1 percent to, including bonuses, 9 percent. Current declared interest rates are generally guaranteed to remain in effect for a period of one year though some are guaranteed for longer periods. Withdrawal charges generally range from zero percent to 20 percent grading to zero over a period of zero to 15 years.
 - 
Guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally range from 0.4 percent to 8.5 percent. The majority of these GICs mature within five years.
 - 
Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are guaranteed at 3 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 2011 was 4.8 percent.
 - 
The universal life funds have credited interest rates of 1 percent to 8 percent and guarantees ranging from 1 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to surrender charges that amount to 10.3 percent of the aggregate fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer than 20 years.
 - 
For variable products and investment contracts, policy values are expressed in terms of investment units. Each unit is linked to an asset portfolio. The value of a unit increases or decreases based on the value of the linked asset portfolio. The current liability at any time is the sum of the current unit value of all investment units plus any liability for guaranteed minimum death or withdrawal benefits.
    Certain products are subject to experience adjustments. These include group life and group medical products, credit life contracts, accident and health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a limited extent,
160            AIG Form 8-K

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
reinsurance agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue, and the unearned portions of the premiums recorded as liabilities. Experience adjustments vary according to the type of contract and the territory in which the policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance.
14. VARIABLE LIFE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS
    AIG reports variable contracts through separate accounts when investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contract holder (traditional variable annuities), and the separate account qualifies for separate account treatment. AIG also reports variable annuity and life contracts through separate accounts, or general accounts when not qualified for separate account reporting, when AIG contractually guarantees to the contract holder (variable contracts with guarantees) either (a) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (and in minor instances, no minimum returns) or (b) the highest contract value attained, typically on any anniversary date minus any subsequent withdrawals following the contract anniversary. These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. Such benefits are referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). For AIG, GMDB is the most widely offered benefit.
    The assets supporting the variable portion of both traditional variable annuities and variable contracts with guarantees are carried at fair value and reported as separate account assets with an equivalent summary total reported as separate account liabilities when the separate account qualifies for separate account treatment. Assets for separate accounts that do not qualify for separate account treatment are reported as trading account assets, and liabilities are included in the respective policyholder liability account of the general account. Amounts assessed against the contract holders for mortality, administrative, and other services are included in revenue and changes in liabilities for minimum guarantees are included in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Separate account net investment income, net investment gains and losses, and the related liability changes are offset within the same line item in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for those accounts that qualify for separate account treatment. Net investment income and gains and losses on trading accounts for contracts that do not qualify for separate account treatment are reported in Net investment income and are principally offset by amounts reported in Policyholder benefits and claims incurred.
The following table presents details concerning AIG's GMDB exposures:
(a)
Included in Policyholder contract deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(b)
Represents the amount of death benefit currently in excess of Account value.
AIG Form 8-K            161
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following summarizes GMDB and GMIB liabilities for guarantees on variable contracts reflected in the general account:
    The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. AIG regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    The following assumptions and methodology were used to determine the GMDB liability at December 31, 2011:
 - 
Data used was up to 1,000 stochastically generated investment performance scenarios.
 - 
Mean investment performance assumptions ranged from three percent to approximately ten percent depending on the block of business.
 - 
Volatility assumption was 16 percent.
 - 
Mortality was assumed at between 50 percent and 88 percent based on various life and annuity mortality tables adjusted for recent experience.
 - 
Lapse rates vary by contract type and duration and ranged from zero percent to 40 percent.
 - 
The discount rate ranged from 3.75 percent to 10 percent and is based on the growth rate assumption for the underlying contracts in effect at the time of policy issuance.
    In addition to GMDB, AIG's contracts currently include to a lesser extent GMIB. The GMIB liability is determined each period end by estimating the expected value of the annuitization benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. AIG periodically evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    AIG contracts currently include GMAV and GMWB benefits. GMAV and GMWB features are considered to be embedded derivatives are recognized at fair value through earnings. AIG enters into derivative contracts to economically hedge a portion of the exposure that arises from GMAV and GMWB. At December 31, 2011, AIG had $14.7 billion of account values and $1.9 billion of net amount at risk that were attributable to variable annuities with GMAV and GMWB benefits. See Note 6 herein for additional fair value disclosures.

AIG GENERAL BORROWINGS
The following table presents maturities of AIG's general borrowings:
Notes and Bonds Payable
    In November 2011, AIG issued senior unsecured notes in exchange for specified series of its outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures. As a result of the exchange offer, AIG issued $256 million in 6.820 percent Dollar notes due 2037, 662 million ($1.03 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) in 6.765 percent Sterling notes due 2017 and 421 million ($545 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) in 6.797 percent Euro notes due 2017. For additional details regarding the exchange offer, see  Junior subordinated debt below.
    In the fourth quarter of 2010, AIG issued an aggregate of $2.0 billion in senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million in three-year notes and $1.5 billion in ten-year notes.
    As of December 31, 2011, approximately $5.7 billion principal amount of senior notes were outstanding under AIG's medium-term note program. The maturity dates of these notes range from 2012 to 2052. To the extent considered appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.
    As of December 31, 2011, the equivalent of $7.8 billion of notes were outstanding under AIG's Euro medium-term note program. The aggregate amount outstanding includes a $174 million gain resulting from foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars related to notes issued to fund the MIP. AIG has economically hedged the currency exposure arising from its foreign currency denominated notes.
    AIG maintains a shelf registration statement in Japan, providing for the issuance of up to 300 billion Japanese Yen ($3.9 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) principal amount of senior notes and there was no balance outstanding at December 31, 2011.

Junior Subordinated Debt
    During 2007 and 2008, AIG issued an aggregate of $12.5 billion of junior subordinated debentures denominated in U.S. dollars, British Pounds and Euros in eight series of securities. In connection with each series of junior subordinated debentures, AIG entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant (RCC) for the benefit of the holders of AIG's 6.25 percent senior notes due 2036. The RCCs provide that AIG will not repay, redeem, or purchase the applicable series of junior subordinated debentures on or before a specified date, unless AIG has received qualifying proceeds from the sale of replacement capital securities.
    In November 2011, AIG exchanged specified series of its outstanding Junior Subordinated Debentures for newly issued senior notes pursuant to an exchange offer. In particular, AIG exchanged (i) $312 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Series A-1 Junior Subordinated Debentures for $256 million aggregate principal amount of its new 6.820 percent Dollar notes due November 15, 2037, (ii) 812 million ($1.26 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Series A-2 and Series A-8 Junior Subordinated Debentures for 662 million ($1.03 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its new 6.765 percent Sterling notes due November 15, 2017 and (iii) 591 million ($766 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its outstanding Series A-3 Junior Subordinated Debentures for 421 million ($545 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of its new 6.797 percent Euro notes due November 15, 2017.
    The exchange resulted in a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $484 million, which is reflected in Net loss on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and a deferred gain of $65 million reflected in Other long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which will be amortized as a reduction to future interest expense.
    In May 2008, as adjusted for the one-for-twenty reverse split of AIG's Common Stock effective June 30, 2009, AIG raised a total of approximately $20 billion through the sale of (i) 9,835,526 shares of AIG Common Stock, in a public offering at a price per share of $760; (ii) 78.4 million Equity Units in a public offering at a price per unit of $75; and (iii) $6.9 billion in unregistered offerings of junior subordinated debentures in three series. In November 2010, AIG exchanged 49,474,600 of its Equity Units for 4,881,667 shares of AIG Common Stock plus $162 million in cash. Each Equity Unit was exchanged for 0.09867 shares of AIG Common Stock plus $3.2702 in cash. The stock and cash received by the Equity Unit holders was the result of netting payments from two separate transactions, a repurchase of the subordinated debentures and a cancellation of the stock purchase contracts. AIG recognized a loss of $104 million as a result of the exchange. Following the completion of the exchange offer, a total of 28,925,400 Equity Units remained outstanding. In 2011, AIG remarketed the three series of debentures included in the Equity Units. AIG purchased and retired all of the Series B-1, B-2 and B-3 Debentures representing $2.2 billion in aggregate principal and as a result, no Series B-1, B-2 or B-3 Debentures remain outstanding. An additional loss of $47 million was recognized from the remarketing activities.
SAFG, Inc. Notes and Bonds Payable
    At December 31, 2011, SAFG, Inc. (formerly American General Corporation) notes and bonds payable aggregating $298 million were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2029 at interest rates from 6.625 percent to 7.50 percent. AIG guarantees the notes and bonds of SAFG, Inc.
Liabilities Connected To Trust Preferred Stock
    In connection with its acquisition of SAFG, Inc. in 2001, AIG entered into arrangements with SAFG, Inc. with respect to outstanding SAFG, Inc. capital securities. In 1996, SAFG, Inc. issued capital securities through a trust to institutional investors and funded the trust with SAFG, Inc. junior subordinated debentures issued to the trust. SAFG, Inc. guaranteed payments to the holders of capital securities only to the extent (i) the trust received payments on the debentures and (ii) these payments were available for the trust to pay to holders of capital

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
securities. In 2001, AIG guaranteed the same payments to the holders of capital securities. Like the SAFG, Inc. guarantee, the AIG guarantee only applies to any payments actually made to the trust in respect of the debentures. If no payments are made on the debentures, AIG is not required to make any payments to the trust. AIG also guaranteed the debentures pursuant to a guarantee that is expressly subordinated to certain SAFG, Inc. senior debt securities. Under AIG's guarantee, AIG is not required to make any payments in respect of the debentures if such payment would be prohibited by the subordination provisions of the debentures. As a result, AIG will never be required to make a payment under its guarantee of the debentures for so long as SAFG, Inc. is prohibited from making a payment on the debentures.
    At December 31, 2011, the preferred stock outstanding consisted of $300 million liquidation value of 8.5 percent preferred stock issued by American General Capital II in June 2000, $500 million liquidation value of 8.125 percent preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital B in March 1997 and $500 million liquidation value of 7.57 percent preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital A in December 1996.
AIG BORROWINGS SUPPORTED BY ASSETS
The following table presents maturities of AIG's borrowings supported by assets:
MIP Notes Payable
    On September 13, 2011, AIG raised $2.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, comprised of $1.2 billion in three-year notes and $800 million in five-year notes. The proceeds from the sale of these notes are being used to pay maturing notes that were issued by AIG to fund the MIP.
Series AIGFP Matched Notes and Bonds Payable
    At December 31, 2011, AIG has outstanding $3.25 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes that were issued in a Rule 144A/Regulation S offering which bear interest at a per annum rate of 8.25 percent and mature in 2018. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used by the Direct Investment book for its general corporate purposes. In addition, the Direct Investment book has used $310 million of senior notes outstanding under AIG's medium-term note program. These notes are included within "Series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable" in the preceding tables.
GIAs at Fair Value
    Borrowings under obligations of GIAs, which are guaranteed by AIG, are recorded at fair value using discounted cash flow calculations based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts and AIG's current market observable implicit credit spread rates with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued. Obligations may be called at various times prior to maturity at the option of the counterparty. Interest rates on these borrowings are primarily fixed, vary by maturity and range up to 9.8 percent.
AIG Form 8-K            165
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    Generally, GIAs have provisions that require collateral to be posted by AIG upon a downgrade of AIG's long-term debt ratings or, at the election of AIG and as an alternative to posting collateral and subject to certain conditions, repayment by AIG of the transactions or arrangement by AIG of a substitute guarantee of AIG's obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings. The actual amount of collateral required to be posted to the counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that AIG could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade. The fair value of securities pledged as collateral with respect to these obligations approximated $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. This collateral primarily consists of securities of U.S. government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties.
Notes and Bonds Payable at Fair Value
    Direct Investment book notes and bonds also include structured debt instruments whose payment terms are linked to one or more financial or other indices (such as an equity index or commodity index or another measure that is not considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt instrument). These notes contain embedded derivatives that otherwise would be required to be accounted for separately. The notes and bonds payable, including the structured debt instruments, are accounted for using the fair value option. The fair value of these obligations was determined by reference to quoted market prices, where available and appropriate, or discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG's current market-observable implicit-credit-spread rates for similar types of obligations with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.
The following table presents a range of maturities and interest rates by currency for AIG's borrowings supported by assets:
    The Direct Investment book economically hedges its notes, bonds and GIAs. As a result, certain of the interest rate or currency exposures set forth in the table above have been hedged with floating rate instruments so the stated rates may not be reflective of the all-in cost of funding after taking into account the related hedges. AIG Parent guarantees all Direct Investment book debt, except for MIP notes payable and series AIGFP matched notes and bonds payable, which are direct obligations of AIG, Inc.

Notes and Bonds Payable
    At December 31, 2011, notes aggregating $13.6 billion were outstanding, consisting of $8.1 billion of term notes and $5.5 billion of medium-term notes with maturities ranging from 2012 to 2022 and interest rates ranging from 0.75 percent to 8.88 percent. Notes aggregating $800 million are at floating interest rates and the remainder are at fixed rates. ILFC enters into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.
    On May 24, 2011, ILFC issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, with $1.0 billion maturing in 2016 and $1.25 billion maturing in 2019. On June 17, 2011, ILFC completed tender offers for the purchase of approximately $1.67 billion aggregate principal amount of notes with maturity dates in 2012 and 2013 for total cash consideration, including accrued interest, of approximately $1.75 billion. ILFC recorded a $61 million loss on the extinguishment of debt. On December 22, 2011, ILFC issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent senior unsecured notes maturing in 2022.
    On December 7, 2010, ILFC issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.25 percent senior notes due December 15, 2020.
    On August 20, 2010, ILFC issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.875 percent senior notes due September 1, 2017. Part of the proceeds from this debt issuance was used to repay loans from AIG, and then used by AIG to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility.
    On March 22, 2010 and April 6, 2010, ILFC issued a combined $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent senior notes due September 15, 2015, and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.750 percent senior notes due March 15, 2017 in private placements. The notes are due in full on their scheduled maturity dates.
    In addition, ILFC had a Euro medium-term note program, which it did not renew when it expired in 2011. All outstanding notes, aggregating $1.2 billion, were repaid at their maturity in August 2011. Notes issued under the Euro medium-term note program are included in ILFC "Notes and bonds payable" in the preceding table of borrowings.
Junior Subordinated Debt
    In December 2005, ILFC issued two tranches of junior subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion. Both tranches mature on December 21, 2065, but each tranche has a different call option. The $600 million tranche had a call option date of December 21, 2010, and the $400 million tranche has a call option date of December 21, 2015. ILFC did not exercise the call option at December 21, 2010 and the interest rate on the $600 million tranche

changed from a fixed interest rate of 5.90 percent to a floating rate with an initial credit spread of 1.55 percent plus the highest of (i) 3 month LIBOR; (ii) 10-year constant maturity treasury; and (iii) 30-year constant maturity treasury. The interest rate will reset quarterly. The $400 million tranche has a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent until the 2015 call option date, and, if ILFC does not exercise the call option, the interest rate will change to a floating rate, reset quarterly, based on the initial credit spread of 1.80 percent plus the highest of (i) 3 month LIBOR; (ii) 10-year constant maturity treasury; and (iii) 30-year constant maturity treasury. If ILFC chooses to redeem the $600 million tranche, 100 percent of the principal amount of the bonds being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date must be paid. If ILFC chooses to redeem only a portion of the outstanding bonds, at least $50 million principal amount of the bonds must remain outstanding.
Export Credit Agency Facility
    ILFC had a $4.3 billion 1999 Export Credit Agency Facility (1999 ECA Facility) that was used in connection with the purchase of 62 Airbus aircraft delivered through 2001. At December 31, 2010, ILFC had five loans with a remaining principal balance of $13 million outstanding under this facility. In January 2011, all of the amounts under the five remaining loans were repaid in full and no amounts remained outstanding under the 1999 ECA Facility.
    ILFC has a similarly structured 2004 Export Credit Agency Facility (2004 ECA Facility), which was amended in May 2009 to allow ILFC to borrow up to a maximum of $4.6 billion to fund the purchase of Airbus aircraft delivered through June 30, 2010. This facility is guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rates are either LIBOR based with spreads ranging from (0.04) percent to 2.25 percent or at fixed rates ranging from 3.40 percent to 4.71 percent. ILFC financed 76 aircraft using approximately $4.3 billion under this facility and approximately $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion were outstanding at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 0.44 percent to 4.71 percent. At December 31, 2010, the interest rate of the loans outstanding ranged from 0.43 percent to 4.71 percent. The debt is collateralized by a pledge of shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the facility. The net book value of the related aircraft was $4.3 billion at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.
    ILFC's current credit ratings require (i) the segregation of security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments received for aircraft funded under its 2004 ECA Facilities into separate accounts, controlled by the trustees of the 2004 ECA Facilities; and (ii) the filings of individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which the aircraft is registered. At December 31, 2011, ILFC had segregated security deposits, maintenance reserves and rental payments aggregating $415 million related to such aircraft. Segregated rental payments are used to pay scheduled principal and interest on the 2004 ECA Facility as they become due.
    During 2010, ILFC entered into agreements to cross-collateralize the two ECA Facilities. In conjunction with the agreement, ILFC agreed to an acceleration event, which would accelerate debt related to the ten aircraft financed during 2010 if, among other things, ILFC were to sell aircraft with an aggregate net book value exceeding an agreed upon amount, currently approximately $10.1 billion, within a period starting from the date of the agreement until December 31, 2012.
    Borrowings with respect to these facilities are included in ILFC's notes and bonds payable in the preceding table of borrowings. New financings are no longer available to ILFC under either the 1999 or 2004 ECA facility.
Bank Financings and Other Secured Financings
    In 2010, ILFC amended its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date of $2.16 billion from October 2011 to October 2012, with the loan secured by aircraft with an appraised value of not less than 133 percent of the principal amount of the outstanding loans, and increased the interest rate by 150

basis points resulting in an interest rate of 2.44 percent. As of December 31, 2011, ILFC had paid down $2.0 billion of this revolving credit facility. The amended facility prohibits ILFC from re-borrowing amounts repaid under this facility for any reason; therefore, the size of the outstanding facility and the total funded amount under the credit facility was $457 million at December 31, 2011. The interest rate of the credit facility was 2.44 percent at December 31, 2011.
    At December 31, 2011, AeroTurbine Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ILFC, had a balance of $269 million on its secured four-year credit facility. The maturity of the credit facility is December 2015 and the interest rate is 3.28 percent. ILFC is a guarantor under the four-year credit facility.
    In addition, at December 31, 2011, ILFC has other secured financings of approximately $6.7 billion that mature through 2018, with interest rates ranging from 3.33 percent to 7.13 percent.
    On August 20, 2010, ILFC issued $1.35 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.5 percent senior secured notes due September 1, 2014, $1.275 billion of aggregate principal amount of 6.75 percent senior secured notes due September 1, 2016, and $1.275 billion of aggregate principal amount of 7.125 percent senior secured notes due September 1, 2018. The proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repay loans from AIG, and then used by AIG to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the FRBNY Credit Facility.
    On March 17, 2010, ILFC entered into a $750 million term loan agreement secured by 43 aircraft and all related equipment and leases. The loan matures on March 17, 2015, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75 percent with a LIBOR floor of 2.0 percent. The principal of the loan is payable in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization; however, ILFC has the right to voluntarily prepay the loan at any time. On March 17, 2010, ILFC also entered into an additional term loan agreement of $550 million, of which $63 million is subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones. The loan is secured by 37 aircraft and all related equipment and leases. The loan matures on March 17, 2016, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 5.0 percent with a LIBOR floor of 2.0 percent. The principal of the loan is payable in full at maturity with no scheduled amortization; however, ILFC has the right to voluntarily prepay the loan at any time, subject to a 1.0 percent prepayment penalty prior to March 17, 2012.
    AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.
Uncollateralized and collateralized notes, bonds, loans and mortgages payable consisted of the following:

16. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES
    In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are entered into by AIG and certain of its subsidiaries. In addition, AIG guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries.
    Although AIG cannot currently quantify its ultimate liability for unresolved litigation and investigation matters, including those referred to below, it is possible that such liability could have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated financial condition or its consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows for an individual reporting period.

(A) LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS
    Overview.
    AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance and financial services industries in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. In AIG's insurance operations (including UGC), litigation arising from claims settlement activities is generally considered in the establishment of AIG's liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense. However, the potential for increasing jury awards and settlements makes it difficult to assess the ultimate outcome of such litigation. AIG is also subject to derivative, class action and other claims asserted by its shareholders and others alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties by its directors and officers and violations of insurance laws and regulations, as well as federal and state securities laws. In the case of any derivative action brought on behalf of AIG, any recovery would accrue to the benefit of AIG.
    Various regulatory and governmental agencies have been reviewing certain public disclosures, transactions and practices of AIG and its subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, AIG's liquidity, compensation paid to certain employees, payments made to counterparties, and certain business practices and valuations of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. AIG has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, in producing documents and other information in response to subpoenas and other requests.
    AIG's life insurance companies have received industry-wide regulatory inquiries, including a multi-state audit covering compliance with unclaimed property laws and a directive from the New York Insurance Department (the New York Directive) regarding claims settlement practices. In particular, the above referenced multi-state audit seeks to require insurers to use the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) to identify potential deceased insureds, notwithstanding that the beneficiary or other payee has not presented the company with a valid claim, to determine whether a claim is payable and to take appropriate action. The multi-state audit covers certain policies in force at any time since 1992. The New York Directive generally requires a similar review and action although the time frame under review is different.
    AIG recorded an increase of $202 million in the estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims in 2011 in conjunction with the use of the SSDMF to identify potential claims not yet presented. Although AIG has enhanced its claims practices to include use of the SSDMF, it is possible that the inquiries, audits and other regulatory activity could result in the payment of additional death claims, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties and interest. AIG believes it is adequately reserved for such claims, but there can be no assurance that the ultimate cost will not vary, perhaps materially, from its estimate. Additionally, state regulators are considering a variety of proposals that would require life insurance companies to take additional steps to identify unreported deceased policy holders.
    The National Association of Insurance Commissioners Market Analysis Working Group, led by the states of Ohio and Iowa, is conducting a multi-state examination of certain accident and health products, including travel products, issued by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (National Union). The examination formally commenced in September 2010 after National Union, based on the identification of certain regulatory issues related to the conduct of its accident and health insurance business, including rate and form issues, producer licensing and appointment, and vendor management, requested that state regulators collectively conduct an examination of the regulatory issues in its accident and health business. In addition to Ohio and Iowa, the lead states in the multi-state examination are Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and currently a total of 38 states have agreed to participate in the multi-state examination. As part of the multi-state examination, the following Interim Consent Orders were entered into with Ohio: (a) on January 7, 2011, in which National Union agreed, on a nationwide basis, to cease marketing directly to individual bank customers accident/sickness policy forms that had been approved to be sold only as policies providing blanket coverage, and to certain related remediation and audit procedures and (b) on February 14, 2012, in which National Union agreed, on a nationwide basis, to limit outbound telemarketing to certain forms and rates. A Consent Order was entered into with Minnesota on February 10, 2012, in which National Union and Travel Guard Group Inc., an AIG subsidiary,

agreed to (i) cease automatically enrolling Minnesota residents in certain insurance relating to air travel, (ii) pay a civil penalty to Minnesota of $250,000 and (iii) refund premium to Minnesota residents who were automatically enrolled in certain insurance relating to air travel. In early 2012, Chartis U.S., Inc., on behalf of itself, National Union, and certain of Chartis U.S., Inc.'s insurance companies (collectively, Chartis U.S.) and the lead regulators agreed in principle upon certain terms to resolve the multi-state examination. The terms include Chartis U.S.'s (i) payment of a civil penalty of up to $51 million, (ii) agreement to enter into a corrective action plan describing agreed-upon specific steps and standards for evaluating Chartis U.S.'s ongoing compliance with laws and regulations governing the regulatory issues identified in the examination, and (iii) agreement to pay a contingent fine in the event that Chartis U.S. fails to substantially comply with the steps and standards agreed to in the corrective action plan. As of December 31, 2011, AIG has an accrued liability equal to the amount of the civil penalty under the proposed agreement. As the terms outlined above are subject to agreement by the lead and participating states and appropriate agreements or orders, AIG (i) can give no assurance that these terms will not change prior to a final resolution of the multi-state examination that is binding on all parties and (ii) cannot predict what other regulatory action, if any, will result from resolving the multi-state examination. There can be no assurance that any regulatory action resulting from the issues identified will not have a material adverse effect on AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period, the ongoing operations of the business being examined, or on similar business written by other AIG carriers. National Union and other AIG companies are also currently subject to civil litigation relating to the conduct of their accident and health business, and may be subject to additional litigation relating to the conduct of such business from time to time in the ordinary course.
    Industry-wide examinations conducted by the Minnesota Department of Insurance and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on captive reinsurance practices by lenders and mortgage insurance companies, including UGC, have been ongoing for several years. Recently, the newly formed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act from HUD, and assumed HUD's aforementioned ongoing investigation. UGC recently received a proposed consent order from the Minnesota Commissioner of Commerce (the MN Commissioner) which alleges that UGC violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other state and federal laws in connection with its practices with captive reinsurance companies owned by lenders. UGC is currently engaged in discussions with the MN Commissioner with respect to the terms of the proposed consent order. UGC cannot predict if or when a consent order may be entered into or, if entered into, what the terms of the final consent order will be. UGC is also currently subject to civil litigation relating to its placement of reinsurance with captives owned by lenders, and may be subject to additional litigation relating to the conduct of such business from time to time in the ordinary course.
AIG's Subprime Exposure, AIGFP Credit Default Swap Portfolio and Related Matters
    AIG, AIGFP and certain directors and officers of AIG, AIGFP and other AIG subsidiaries have been named in various actions relating to AIG's exposure to the U.S. residential subprime mortgage market, unrealized market valuation losses on AIGFP's super senior credit default swap portfolio, losses and liquidity constraints relating to AIG's securities lending program and related disclosure and other matters (Subprime Exposure Issues).
    Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation.
    Between May 21, 2008 and January 15, 2009, eight purported securities class action complaints were filed against AIG and certain directors and officers of AIG and AIGFP, AIG's outside auditors, and the underwriters of various securities offerings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the Southern District of New York), alleging claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or claims under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act). On March 20, 2009, the Court consolidated all eight of the purported securities class actions as In re American International Group, Inc. 2008 Securities Litigation (the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation). Subsequently, on November 18, 2011 and January 20, 2012, two separate, though similar, securities actions were brought against

AIG and certain directors and officers of AIG and AIGFP by the Kuwait Investment Office and various Oppenheimer Funds, respectively.
    On May 19, 2009, lead plaintiff in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation filed a consolidated complaint on behalf of purchasers of AIG Common Stock during the alleged class period of March 16, 2006 through September 16, 2008, and on behalf of purchasers of various AIG securities offered pursuant to AIG's shelf registration statements. The consolidated complaint alleges that defendants made statements during the class period in press releases, AIG's quarterly and year-end filings, during conference calls, and in various registration statements and prospectuses in connection with the various offerings that were materially false and misleading and that artificially inflated the price of AIG Common Stock. The alleged false and misleading statements relate to, among other things, the Subprime Exposure Issues. The consolidated complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. On August 5, 2009, defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and on September 27, 2010, the Court denied the motions to dismiss.
    On November 24, 2010 and December 10, 2010, AIG and all other defendants filed answers to the consolidated complaint denying the material allegations therein and asserting their defenses.
    On April 1, 2011, the lead plaintiff in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation filed a motion to certify a class of plaintiffs. On November 2, 2011, the Court terminated the motion without prejudice to an application for restoration.
    As of February 23, 2012, plaintiffs in the Consolidated 2008 Securities Litigation have not specified an amount of alleged damages, discovery is ongoing and the Court has not determined if a class action is appropriate or the size or scope of any class. As a result, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.
    As of February 23, 2012, the actions initiated by the Kuwait Investment Office and various Oppenheimer Funds are in their early stages, no discussions concerning potential damages have occurred and the plaintiffs have not specified an amount of alleged damages in their respective actions. As a result, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these litigations.
    ERISA Actions  Southern District of New York.
    Between June 25, 2008, and November 25, 2008, AIG, certain directors and officers of AIG, and members of AIG's Retirement Board and Investment Committee were named as defendants in eight purported class action complaints asserting claims on behalf of participants in certain pension plans sponsored by AIG or its subsidiaries. On March 19, 2009, the Court consolidated these eight actions as In re American International Group, Inc. ERISA Litigation II. On June 26, 2009, lead plaintiffs' counsel filed a consolidated amended complaint. The action purports to be brought as a class action under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), on behalf of all participants in or beneficiaries of certain benefit plans of AIG and its subsidiaries that offered shares of AIG Common Stock. In the consolidated amended complaint, plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary responsibilities to plan participants and their beneficiaries under ERISA, by continuing to offer the AIG Stock Fund as an investment option in the plans after it allegedly became imprudent to do so. The alleged ERISA violations relate to, among other things, the defendants' purported failure to monitor and/or disclose certain matters, including the Subprime Exposure Issues. On September 18, 2009, defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint.
    On March 31, 2011, the Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss with respect to one plan at issue, and denied defendants' motions to dismiss with respect to the other two plans at issue.

    On August 5, 2011, AIG and all other defendants filed answers to the consolidated complaint denying the material allegations therein and asserting their defenses.
    As of February 23, 2012, plaintiffs have not specified an amount of alleged damages, discovery is ongoing, and the Court has not determined if a class action is appropriate or the size or scope of any class. As a result, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.
    Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation.
    On November 20, 2007 and August 6, 2008, purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Southern District of New York naming as defendants directors and officers of AIG and its subsidiaries and asserting claims on behalf of nominal defendant AIG. The actions have been consolidated as In re American International Group, Inc. 2007 Derivative Litigation (the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation). On June 3, 2009, lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint naming additional directors and officers of AIG and its subsidiaries as defendants. As amended, the factual allegations include the Subprime Exposure Issues and AIG and AIGFP employee retention payments and related compensation issues. The claims asserted on behalf of nominal defendant AIG include breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, contribution and violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On August 5 and 26, 2009, AIG and defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On December 18, 2009, a separate action, previously commenced in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (Central District of California) and transferred to the Southern District of New York on June 5, 2009, was consolidated into the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation and dismissed without prejudice to the pursuit of the claims in the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation.
    On March 30, 2010, the Court dismissed the action due to plaintiff's failure to make a pre-suit demand on AIG's Board of Directors. On March 17, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit) affirmed the Southern District of New York's dismissal of the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation due to plaintiff's failure to make a pre-suit demand.
    On August 10, 2011 and August 15, 2011, the plaintiff that brought the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation sent letters to AIG's Board of Directors (the Board) demanding that the Board cause AIG to pursue the claims asserted in the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation. On September 13, 2011, the Board rejected the demand.
    Other Derivative Actions.
    Separate purported derivative actions, alleging similar claims as the Consolidated 2007 Derivative Litigation, have been brought asserting claims on behalf of the nominal defendant AIG in various jurisdictions. These actions are described below:
 - 
Supreme Court of New York, Nassau County.
    On February 29, 2008, a purported shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of Nassau County, naming as defendants certain directors and officers of AIG and its subsidiaries. On March 9, 2009, this action was stayed.
 - 
Supreme Court of New York, New York County.
    On March 20, 2009, a purported shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of New York County naming as defendants certain directors and officers of AIG and recipients of AIGFP retention payments. The complaint has not been served on any defendant.
 - 
Delaware Court of Chancery.
    On September 17, 2008, a purported shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, naming as defendants certain directors and officers of AIG and its subsidiaries. On July 17, 2009 the case was stayed. On May 4, 2011, the parties filed a stipulation with the court agreeing to lift the stay, and granting plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. On June 17, 2011, AIG filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint due to plaintiff's failure to make a pre-suit demand on the Board. On February 1, 2012, the Court approved a stipulation between the parties, dismissing the second amended complaint with prejudice.

    Southern District of New York.
    On January 4, 2011, Wanda Mimms, a participant in the AIG Incentive Savings Plan (the Plan), filed a purported derivative action on behalf of the Plan in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (PwC) and asserting a claim for professional malpractice in conducting audits of AIG's 2007 financial statements. The complaint, as amended on April 20, 2011, also asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA against members of the Plan's Retirement Board for failing to pursue a claim for professional malpractice on behalf of the Plan against PwC. On July 6, 2011, the Plan and defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. On February 16, 2012, the Court granted the motions to dismiss and dismissed the amended complaint without leave to replead.
    Canadian Securities Class Action  Ontario Superior Court of Justice.
    On November 12, 2008, an application was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for leave to bring a purported class action against AIG, AIGFP, certain directors and officers of AIG and Joseph Cassano, the former Chief Executive Officer of AIGFP, pursuant to the Ontario Securities Act. If the Court grants the application, a class plaintiff will be permitted to file a statement of claim against defendants. The proposed statement of claim would assert a class period of November 10, 2006 through September 16, 2008 (later amended to March 16, 2006 through September 16, 2008) and would allege that during this period defendants made false and misleading statements and omissions in quarterly and annual reports and during oral presentations in violation of the Ontario Securities Act.
    On April 17, 2009, defendants filed a motion record in support of their motion to stay or dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. On July 12, 2010, the Court adjourned a hearing on the motion pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in another action with respect to similar issues raised in the action pending against AIG.
    In plaintiff's proposed statement of claim, plaintiff alleged general and special damages of $500 million, and punitive damages of $50 million plus prejudgment interest or such other sums as the Court finds appropriate. As of February 23, 2012, the Court has not determined whether it has jurisdiction or granted plaintiff's application to file a statement of claim and no merits discovery has occurred. As a result, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.
    Starr International Litigation 
 On November 21, 2011, Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO) filed a complaint against the Department of the Treasury in the United States Court of Federal Claims, bringing claims, both individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated and derivatively on behalf of AIG (the Starr Treasury Action). The complaint challenges the government's assistance of AIG, pursuant to which AIG entered into the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury received an approximately 80 percent ownership in AIG. The complaint alleges that the interest rate imposed on AIG and the appropriation of approximately 80 percent of AIG's equity was discriminatory, unprecedented, and inconsistent with liquidity assistance offered by the Government to other comparable firms at the time and violated the Equal Protection, Due Process, and Takings Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.
    On the same day that SICO commenced the Starr Treasury Action, SICO also filed a second complaint in the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York, this one against the FRBNY bringing claims, both individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated and derivatively on behalf of AIG. This complaint also challenges the Government's assistance of AIG, pursuant to which AIG entered into the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Department of the Treasury received an approximately 80 percent ownership in AIG. The complaint alleges that the FRBNY owed fiduciary duties to AIG as a controlling shareholder of AIG, and that the FRBNY breached these fiduciary duties by "divert[ing] the rights and assets of AIG and its shareholders to itself
174            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and favored third parties" through transactions involving ML III, an entity controlled by FRBNY, and by "participating in, and causing AIG's officers and directors to participate in, the evasion of AIG's existing Common Stock shareholders' right to approve the massive issuance of the new Common Shares required to complete the Government's taking of a nearly 80 percent interest in the Common Stock of AIG." SICO also alleges that the "FRBNY has asserted that in exercising its control over, and acting on behalf of, AIG it did not act in an official, governmental capacity or at the direction of the Department of the Treasury," but that "[t]o the extent the proof at or prior to trial shows that the FRBNY did in fact act in a governmental capacity, or at the direction of the Department of the Treasury, the improper conduct . . . constitutes the discriminatory takings of the property and property rights of AIG without due process or just compensation."
    In both of the actions commenced by SICO, the only claims naming AIG as a party are derivative claims on behalf of AIG, and AIG thus faces no potential damages. The FRBNY has requested indemnification under the FRBNY Credit Facility from AIG in connection with the action against it and AIG is discussing the request and its scope with the FRBNY. On January 31, 2012 and February 1, 2012, amended complaints were filed in the Court of Claims and the Southern District of New York, respectively. These amended complaints contain additional factual allegations, but do not contain any new claims against the Department of Treasury, the FRBNY or AIG.
Other Litigation Related to AIGFP
    On September 30, 2009, Brookfield Asset Management, Inc. and Brysons International, Ltd. (together, Brookfield) filed a complaint against AIG and AIGFP in the Southern District of New York. Brookfield seeks a declaration that a 1990 interest rate swap agreement between Brookfield and AIGFP (guaranteed by AIG) terminated upon the occurrence of certain alleged events that Brookfield contends constituted defaults under the swap agreement's standard "bankruptcy" default provision. Brookfield claims that it is excused from all future payment obligations under the swap agreement on the basis of the purported termination. At December 31, 2011, the estimated present value of expected future cash flows discounted at LIBOR was $1.5 billion, which represents AIG's maximum contractual loss from the alleged termination of the contract. It is AIG's position that no termination event has occurred and that the swap agreement remains in effect. A determination that a termination event has occurred could result in AIG losing its entitlement to all future payments under the swap agreement and result in a loss to AIG of the full value at which AIG is carrying the swap agreement.
    Additionally, a determination that AIG triggered a "bankruptcy" event of default under the swap agreement could also, depending on the Court's precise holding, affect other AIG or AIGFP agreements that contain the same or similar default provisions. Such a determination could also affect derivative agreements or other contracts between third parties, such as credit default swaps under which AIG is a reference credit, which could affect the trading price of AIG securities. During the third quarter of 2011, beneficiaries of certain previously repaid AIGFP guaranteed investment agreements brought an action against AIG Parent and AIGFP making "bankruptcy" event of default allegations similar to those made by Brookfield. AIG has moved to dismiss that complaint.
    On December 17, 2009, AIG and AIGFP filed a motion to dismiss Brookfield's complaint. On September 28, 2010, the Court issued a decision granting defendants' motion in part and denying it in part, holding that the complaint: (i) failed to allege that an event of default had occurred based upon defendants' failure to pay or inability to pay debts as they became due; but, (ii) sufficiently alleged that an event of default had occurred based upon other sections of the swap agreement's "bankruptcy" default provision. On January 26, 2011, Brookfield filed an amended complaint that sought to reassert, on the basis of additional factual allegations, the claims that were dismissed from the initial complaint. While AIG initially moved to dismiss the claim that Brookfield sought to reassert in its amended complaint, after Brookfield filed a second amended complaint on September 15, 2011, AIG informed the Court that, in light of the advanced stage of fact discovery in the case, it intends to defer seeking to dismiss Brookfield's claims until motions for summary judgment have been filed, when the discovery

record can be considered. AIG and AIGFP filed an answer to the second amended complaint on November 8, 2011. Fact discovery is currently scheduled to conclude on May 15, 2012.
Securities Lending Dispute with Transatlantic Holdings Inc.
    On May 24, 2010, Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic) and two of its subsidiaries, Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and Trans Re Zurich Reinsurance Company Ltd. (collectively, Claimants), commenced an arbitration proceeding before the American Arbitration Association in New York against AIG and two of its subsidiaries (the AIG Respondents). Claimants allege breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and common law fraud in connection with certain securities lending agency agreements between AIG's subsidiaries and Claimants. Claimants allege that AIG and its subsidiaries should be liable for the losses that Claimants purport to have suffered in connection with securities lending and investment activities, and seek damages of $350 million and other unspecified damages.
    On June 29, 2010, AIG brought a petition in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, seeking to enjoin the arbitration on the ground that AIG is not a party to the securities lending agency agreements with Claimants. On July 29, 2010, the parties agreed to resolve that petition by consolidating the arbitration commenced by Claimants with a separate arbitration, commenced by AIG on June 29, 2010, in which AIG is seeking damages of Euro 17.6 million ($22.8 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate) from Transatlantic for breach of a Master Separation Agreement among Transatlantic, AIG and one of its subsidiary companies.
    On September 13, 2010, the AIG Respondents submitted an answer to Claimants' claims asserting, among other things, that there was no breach of the securities lending agency agreements, and that Claimants' other allegations including purported breach of fiduciary duty and fraud are not meritorious. Transatlantic submitted an answer denying liability with respect to AIG's claim on September 13, 2010. Claimants recently increased its claimed damages to an amount of approximately $500 million.
    On January 26, 2012, AIG Respondents and Claimants reached a binding agreement to terminate the arbitration proceedings and to dismiss all claims between the parties without any admission of liability by any of the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties will first seek to reach an overall mediated settlement of the claims in the arbitration proceeding along with various other business matters that were not at issue in the arbitration. If a mediated resolution including all claims and outstanding business issues cannot be reached by April 30, 2012, then the parties will try to reach a mediated resolution of the securities lending claims only, including a settlement payment to Transatlantic between $45 million and $125 million. If the parties cannot reach such resolution, the parties have agreed that the mediator will, by June 1, 2012, determine the amount of a settlement payment to Transatlantic with respect to the securities lending claims in a range between $45 million and $125 million. Accordingly, AIG has accrued an amount it believes is reasonable for this settlement.
Employment Litigation against AIG and AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corporation
    Fitzpatrick matter.
    On December 9, 2009, AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corporation's (AIGGRE) former President, Kevin P. Fitzpatrick, several entities he controls, and various other single purpose entities (the SPEs) filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County against AIG and AIGGRE (the Defendants). The case was removed to the Southern District of New York, and an amended complaint was filed on March 8, 2010. The amended complaint asserts that the Defendants violated fiduciary duties to Fitzpatrick and his controlled entities and breached Fitzpatrick's employment agreement and agreements of SPEs that purportedly entitled him to carried interest fees arising out of the sale or disposition of certain real estate. Fitzpatrick has also brought derivative claims on behalf of the SPEs, purporting to allege that the Defendants breached contractual and fiduciary duties in failing to fund the SPEs with various amounts allegedly due under the SPE agreements. Fitzpatrick has also requested injunctive relief, an accounting, and that a receiver be appointed to manage the affairs of the SPEs. He has further alleged that the SPEs are subject to a constructive
176            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
trust. Fitzpatrick also has alleged a violation of ERISA relating to retirement benefits purportedly due. Fitzpatrick has claimed that he is currently owed damages totaling approximately $196 million, and that potential future amounts owed to him are approximately $78 million, for a total of approximately $274 million. Fitzpatrick further claims unspecified amounts of carried interest on certain additional real estate assets of AIG and its affiliates. He also seeks punitive damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Defendants assert that Fitzpatrick has been paid all amounts currently due and owing pursuant to the various agreements through which he seeks recovery. As set forth above, the possible range of loss to AIG is $0 to $274 million, although Fitzpatrick claims that he is also entitled to additional unspecified amounts of carried interest and punitive damages.
    Defendants filed counterclaims against Fitzpatrick and a motion to dismiss. On September 28, 2010, the Court dismissed the Defendants' counterclaims, and denied Defendants' motion to dismiss. On March 14, 2011, both plaintiffs and defendants filed motions for partial summary judgment. Those motions are still pending, and no trial date has been set.
    Behm matter.
    Frank Behm, former President of AIG Global Real Estate Asia Pacific, Inc. ("AIGGREAP"), has filed two actions in connection with the termination of his employment. Behm filed an action on or about October 1, 2010 in Delaware Superior Court in which he asserts claims of breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing for termination in violation of public policy, deprivation of compensation, and breach of contract. Additionally, on or about March 29, 2011, Behm filed an arbitration proceeding before the American Arbitration Association alleging wrongful termination, in which he seeks the payment of carried interest or "promote" distributed through the SPEs, based on the sales of certain real estate assets. Behm also contends that he is entitled to promote as a third-party beneficiary of Kevin Fitzpatrick's employment agreement, which, Behm claims, defines broadly a class of individuals, allegedly including himself, who, with the approval of AIG's Chief Investment Officer, became eligible to receive promote payments. Behm is claiming approximately $33 million in carried interest. Multiple AIG entities (the AIG Entities) are named as parties in each of the Behm matters. The AIG Entities have filed a counterclaim in the Delaware case, contending that Behm owes them approximately $3.6 million (before pre-judgment interest) in tax equalization payments made by the AIG Entities on Behm's behalf.
    Both matters filed by Behm are premised on the same key allegations. Behm claims that the AIG Entities wrongfully terminated him from AIGGREAP in an effort to silence him for voicing opposition to allegedly improper practices concerning the amount of AIG reserves for carried interest that Behm contends is due to him and others. The AIG Entities contend that their reserves are appropriate, as Behm's claim for additional carried interest are without merit. Behm claims that, when he refused to accede to the AIG Entities' position as to the amount of carried interest due, he was targeted for investigation and subsequently terminated, purportedly for providing confidential AIG information to a competitor, and its executive search firm. Behm argues that he did not disclose any confidential information; instead, he met with several of the competitor's representatives in order to foster interest in purchasing AIGGREAP.
    The parties have finalized the selection of the arbitration panel and the arbitration hearing dates have been set for May 2012. No trial date has been set in the Delaware action. As set forth above, the possible range of loss to AIG is $0 to $33 million, although Behm claims that he is also entitled to additional unspecified amounts of carried interest and punitive damages.
False Claims Act Complaint
    On February 25, 2010, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California by two individuals (Relators) seeking to assert claims on behalf of the United States against AIG and certain other defendants, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, under the False Claims Act. Relators filed a First Amended Complaint on September 30, 2010, adding certain additional defendants, including Bank of America and Socit Gnrale. The amended complaint alleges that defendants engaged in fraudulent business

practices in respect of their activities in the over-the-counter market for collateralized debt obligations, and submitted false claims to the United States in connection with the FRBNY Credit Facility and the Maiden Lane Interests through, among other things, misrepresenting AIG's ability and intent to repay amounts drawn on the FRBNY Credit Facility, and misrepresenting the value of the securities that the Maiden Lane Interests acquired from AIG and certain of its counterparties. The complaint seeks unspecified damages pursuant to the False Claims Act in the amount of three times the damages allegedly sustained by the United States as well as interest, attorneys' fees, costs and expenses. The complaint and amended complaints were initially filed and maintained under seal while the United States considered whether to intervene in the action. On or about April 28, 2011, after the United States declined to intervene, the District Court lifted the seal, and Relators served the amended complaint on AIG on July 11, 2011.
    On October 14, 2011, the defendants that had been served filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint, which are currently pending. The Court will hear oral argument on those motions on April 23, 2012. The Relators have not specified in their amended complaint an amount of alleged damages. As a result, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.
2006 Regulatory Settlements and Related Regulatory Matters
    2006 Regulatory Settlements.
    In February 2006, AIG reached a resolution of claims and matters under investigation with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) and the New York State Department of Insurance (DOI). The settlements resolved investigations conducted by the SEC, NYAG and DOI in connection with the accounting, financial reporting and insurance brokerage practices of AIG and its subsidiaries, as well as claims relating to the underpayment of certain workers' compensation premium taxes and other assessments. These settlements did not, however, resolve investigations by regulators from other states into insurance brokerage practices related to contingent commissions and other broker-related conduct, such as alleged bid rigging. Nor did the settlements resolve any obligations that AIG may have to state guarantee funds in connection with any of these matters.
    As a result of these settlements, AIG made payments or placed amounts in escrow in 2006 totaling approximately $1.64 billion, $225 million of which represented fines and penalties.
    In addition to the escrowed funds, $800 million was deposited into, and subsequently disbursed by, a fund under the supervision of the SEC, to resolve claims asserted against AIG by investors, including the securities class action and shareholder lawsuits described below. Additional amounts held in escrow totaling approximately $597 million, including interest thereon, are included in Other assets at December 31, 2011, and, as discussed below, are specifically designated to satisfy regulatory and class-action liabilities related to workers' compensation premium reporting issues. Approximately $338 million of the $597 million of the current total workers' compensation related escrow amount was originally held in an account established as part of the 2006 New York regulatory settlement and referred to as the Workers' Compensation Fund.
    On February 1, 2012, AIG was informed by the SEC that AIG had complied with the terms of the settlement order under which AIG had agreed to retain an independent consultant, and as of that date, was no longer subject to such order.
    Other Regulatory Settlements.
    AIG's 2006 regulatory settlements with the SEC, DOJ, NYAG and DOI did not resolve investigations by regulators from other states into insurance brokerage practices. AIG entered into agreements effective in early 2008 with the Attorneys General of the States of Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, Texas and West Virginia; the Commonwealths of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania; and the District of Columbia; as well as the Florida Department of Financial Services and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, relating to their respective industry-wide investigations into producer compensation and insurance

American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
placement practices. The settlements called for total payments of $26 million by AIG, of which $4.4 million was paid under previous settlement agreements. During the term of the settlement agreements, which run through early 2018, AIG will continue to maintain certain producer compensation disclosure and ongoing compliance initiatives. AIG will also continue to cooperate with the industry-wide investigations. On April 7, 2010, it was announced that AIG and the Ohio Attorney General entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the Ohio Attorney General's claim concerning producer compensation and insurance placement practices. AIG paid the Ohio Attorney General $9 million as part of that settlement.
    NAIC Examination of Workers' Compensation Premium Reporting.
    During 2006, the Settlement Review Working Group of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), under the direction of the States of Indiana, Minnesota and Rhode Island, began an investigation into AIG's reporting of workers' compensation premiums. In late 2007, the Settlement Review Working Group recommended that a multi-state targeted market conduct examination focusing on workers' compensation insurance be commenced under the direction of the NAIC's Market Analysis Working Group. AIG was informed of the multi-state targeted market conduct examination in January 2008. The lead states in the multi-state examination are Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. All other states (and the District of Columbia) have agreed to participate in the multi-state examination. The examination focused on legacy issues related to AIG's writing and reporting of workers' compensation insurance prior to 1996 and current compliance with legal requirements applicable to such business.
    On December 17, 2010, AIG and the lead states reached an agreement to settle all regulatory liabilities arising out of the subjects of the multistate examination. The regulatory settlement agreement, which has been agreed to by all 50 states and the District of Columbia, includes, among other terms, (i) AIG's payment of $100 million in regulatory fines and penalties; (ii) AIG's payment of $46.5 million in outstanding premium taxes; (iii) AIG's agreement to enter into a compliance plan describing agreed-upon specific steps and standards for evaluating AIG's ongoing compliance with state regulations governing the setting of workers' compensation insurance premium rates and the reporting of workers' compensation premiums; and (iv) AIG's agreement to pay up to $150 million in contingent fines in the event that AIG fails to comply substantially with the compliance plan requirements. The $146.5 million in fines, penalties and premium taxes have been funded out of the $338 million originally held in the Workers' Compensation Fund and placed into an escrow account pursuant to the terms of the regulatory settlement agreement. The regulatory settlement is contingent upon and will not become effective until, among other events: (i) a final, court-approved settlement is reached in all the lawsuits that comprise the Workers' Compensation Premium Reporting Litigation, discussed below, including the putative class action, except that such settlement need not resolve claims between AIG and the Liberty Mutual Group in order for the regulatory settlement to become effective and (ii) a settlement is reached and consummated between AIG and certain state insurance guaranty funds that may assert claims against AIG for underpayment of guaranty-fund assessments.
    As of December 31, 2011, AIG has an accrued liability for the amounts payable under the proposed settlement.
Litigation Related to the Matters Underlying the 2006 Regulatory Settlements
    AIG and certain present and former directors and officers of AIG have been named in various actions related to the matters underlying the 2006 Regulatory Settlements. These actions are described below.
    The Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation.
    Beginning in October 2004, a number of putative securities fraud class action suits were filed in the Southern District of New York against AIG and consolidated as In re American International Group, Inc. Securities Litigation (the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation). Subsequently, a separate, though similar, securities fraud action was also brought against AIG by certain Florida pension funds. The lead plaintiff in the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation is a group of public retirement systems and pension funds benefiting Ohio state employees, suing on behalf of themselves and all purchasers of AIG's publicly

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
traded securities between October 28, 1999 and April 1, 2005. The named defendants are AIG and a number of present and former AIG officers and directors, as well as C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. (Starr), Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO), General Reinsurance Corporation (General Re), and PwC, among others. The lead plaintiff alleges, among other things, that AIG: (i) concealed that it engaged in anti-competitive conduct through alleged payment of contingent commissions to brokers and participation in illegal bid-rigging; (ii) concealed that it used "income smoothing" products and other techniques to inflate its earnings; (iii) concealed that it marketed and sold "income smoothing" insurance products to other companies; and (iv) misled investors about the scope of government investigations. In addition, the lead plaintiff alleges that Maurice R. Greenberg, AIG's former Chief Executive Officer, manipulated AIG's stock price. The lead plaintiff asserts claims for violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Sections 20(a) and Section 20A of the Exchange Act.
    On July 14, 2010, AIG approved the terms of a settlement (the Settlement) with lead plaintiffs. The Settlement is conditioned on, among other things, court approval and a minimum level of shareholder participation. Under the terms of the Settlement, if consummated, AIG would pay an aggregate of $725 million.
    On July 20, 2010, at the joint request of AIG and lead plaintiffs, the District Court entered an order staying all deadlines in the case. On November 30, 2010, AIG and lead plaintiffs executed their agreement of settlement and compromise. On November 30, 2010, lead plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with AIG.
    On October 5, 2011, the District Court granted lead plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement between AIG and lead plaintiffs. Notices to class members of the settlement were mailed on October 14, 2011. On December 2, 2011, Lead Plaintiff filed a motion for final approval of the settlement and for attorneys' fees. Objections to the settlement and requests to be excluded from the settlement were due to the District Court by December 30, 2011. Only two shareholders objected to the settlement, and 25 shareholders claiming to hold less than 1.5 percent of AIG's outstanding shares at the end of the class period submitted timely and valid requests to opt out of the class. Of those 25 shareholders, seven are investment funds controlled by the same investment group, and that investment group is the only opt-out who held more than 1,000 shares at the end of the class period. By order dated February 2, 2012, the District Court granted lead plaintiffs' motion for final approval of the Settlement between AIG and lead plaintiffs. AIG has fully funded the amount of the Settlement into an escrow account. On February 17, 2012, one of the objectors filed a notice to appeal the District Court's February 2, 2012 order to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
    On January 23, 2012, AIG and the Florida pension funds, who had brought a separate securities fraud action, executed a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, AIG paid $4 million.
    The Multi-District Litigation.
    Commencing in 2004, policyholders brought multiple federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) class actions in jurisdictions across the nation against insurers and brokers, including AIG and a number of its subsidiaries, alleging that the insurers and brokers engaged in one or more broad conspiracies to allocate customers, steer business, and rig bids. These actions, including 24 complaints filed in different federal courts naming AIG or an AIG subsidiary as a defendant, were consolidated by the judicial panel on multi-district litigation and transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (District of New Jersey) for coordinated pretrial proceedings. The consolidated actions have proceeded in that Court in two parallel actions, In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation (the Commercial Complaint) and In re Employee Benefits Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation (the Employee Benefits Complaint, and, together with the Commercial Complaint, the Multi-District Litigation).
    The plaintiffs in the Commercial Complaint are a group of corporations, individuals and public entities that contracted with the broker defendants for the provision of insurance brokerage services for a variety of insurance needs. The broker defendants are alleged to have placed insurance coverage on the plaintiffs' behalf with a number of insurance companies named as defendants, including AIG subsidiaries. The Commercial Complaint
180            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
also named various brokers and other insurers as defendants (three of which have since settled). The Commercial Complaint alleges that defendants engaged in a number of overlapping "broker-centered" conspiracies to allocate customers through the payment of contingent commissions to brokers and through purported "bid-rigging" practices. It also alleges that the insurer and broker defendants participated in a "global" conspiracy not to disclose to policyholders the payment of contingent commissions. Plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, RICO, and the antitrust laws of 48 states and the District of Columbia, and are liable under common law breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment theories. Plaintiffs seek treble damages plus interest and attorneys' fees as a result of the alleged RICO and Sherman Antitrust Act violations.
    The plaintiffs in the Employee Benefits Complaint are a group of individual employees and corporate and municipal employers alleging claims on behalf of two separate nationwide purported classes: an employee class and an employer class that acquired insurance products from the defendants from January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2004. The Employee Benefits Complaint names AIG, as well as various other brokers and insurers, as defendants. The activities alleged in the Employee Benefits Complaint, with certain exceptions, track the allegations of customer allocation through steering and bid-rigging made in the Commercial Complaint.
    The District Court, in connection with the Commercial and Employee Benefits Complaints, granted (without leave to amend) defendants' motions to dismiss the federal antitrust and RICO claims on August 31, 2007 and September 28, 2007, respectively. The Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims in the Commercial Complaint and therefore dismissed it in its entirety. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the Commercial Complaint to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the Third Circuit) on October 10, 2007. On January 14, 2008, the District Court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs' ERISA claims in the Employee Benefits Complaint. On February 12, 2008, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Third Circuit with respect to the dismissal of the antitrust and RICO claims in the Employee Benefits Complaint.
    On August 16, 2010, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the Employee Benefits Complaint in its entirety, affirmed in part and vacated in part the District Court's dismissal of the Commercial Complaint, and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. Specifically, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of plaintiffs' broader antitrust and RICO claims, but the Court reversed the District Court's dismissal of alleged "Marsh-centered" antitrust and RICO claims based on allegations of bid-rigging involving excess casualty insurance. The Court remanded these Marsh-centered claims to the District Court for consideration as to whether plaintiffs had adequately pleaded them. Because the Third Circuit vacated in part the judgment dismissing the federal claims in the Commercial Complaint, the Third Circuit also vacated the District Court's dismissal of the state-law claims in the Commercial Complaint.
    On October 1, 2010, defendants named in the Commercial Complaint filed motions to dismiss the remaining remanded claims in the District of New Jersey. On March 18, 2011, AIG and certain other defendants announced that they had entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with class plaintiffs to settle the claims asserted against them in the Commercial Complaint. As of May 20, 2011, the parties to the MOU and certain other defendants entered into a Stipulation of Settlement. Under the terms of the settlement, it is anticipated that AIG will pay $6.75 million of a total aggregate settlement amount of approximately $37 million. The settlement is conditioned on final court approval. Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and litigation expenses, and the aggregate costs of notice and claims administration in connection with the settlement, would be paid from the settlement fund.
    On June 20, 2011, the Court "administratively terminated" without prejudice the various Defendants' pending motions to dismiss the proposed class plaintiffs' operative pleading indicating that those motions may be re-filed after adjudication of all issues related to the proposed class settlement and subject to the approval of the Magistrate Judge. On June 27, 2011, the Court preliminarily approved the class settlement. On June 30, 2011, AIG placed its portion of the total settlement payment into escrow. If the settlement does not receive final court approval, those funds will revert to AIG. A final fairness hearing was held on September 14, 2011. The Court has not yet ruled on the motion for final approval of the class settlement.
AIG Form 8-K            181
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    A number of complaints making allegations similar to those in the Multi-District Litigation have been filed against AIG and other defendants in state and federal courts around the country. The defendants have thus far been successful in having the federal actions transferred to the District of New Jersey and consolidated into the Multi-District Litigation. These additional consolidated actions are still pending in the District of New Jersey, but are currently stayed. In one of those consolidated actions,
Palm Tree Computer Systems, Inc. v. Ace USA (Palm Tree)
, which is brought by two named plaintiffs on behalf of a proposed class of insurance purchasers, the plaintiffs allege specifically with respect to their claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the insurer defendants that neither named plaintiff nor any member of the proposed class suffered damages "exceeding $74,999 each." Plaintiffs do not specify damages as to other claims against the insurer defendants in the complaint. The plaintiffs in
Palm Tree
have not yet sought certification of the class, as that case has been stayed by the District Court of New Jersey. Because discovery has not been completed and the District Court has not determined if a class action is appropriate or the size or scope of any class, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the
Palm Tree
litigation. In another consolidated action,
The Heritage Corp. of South Florida v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. (Heritage)
, an individual plaintiff alleges damages "in excess of $75,000." Because discovery has not been completed and a precise amount of damages has not been specified, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the
Heritage
litigation. For the remaining consolidated actions, as of February, 2012, plaintiffs have not specified an amount of alleged damages arising from these actions. AIG is therefore unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from these matters.
    In June 2011, the Court ordered counsel for each of the tag-along actions in the Multi-District Litigation (including the following cases where AIG is a defendant:
Avery Dennison Corp. v. Marsh & McLennan Companies,  Inc.; Henley Management Co. v. Marsh Inc.; Heritage; and Palm Tree
) to submit a letter to the Court within 30 days of the date of that order that outlines the effect the current proposed class settlement will have on their respective cases if finalized in due course. In July 2011, several plaintiffs submitted letters to the Court. Defendants submitted an omnibus response to the Court on August 19, 2011.
    On October 17, 2011, the Court conducted a conference and subsequently ordered that discovery and motion practice may proceed in all tag-along actions. The parties were ordered to submit a proposed scheduling order for discovery and any additional motion practice to the Court by October 31, 2011. The Court has not yet issued a scheduling order.
    The AIG defendants have also sought to have state court actions making similar allegations stayed pending resolution of the Multi-District Litigation proceeding. These efforts have generally been successful, although four cases have proceeded; one each in Florida and New Jersey state courts that have settled, and one each in Texas and Kansas state courts have proceeded (although discovery is stayed in both actions). In the Texas action, plaintiff filed its Fourth Amended Petition on July 13, 2009 and on August 14, 2009, defendants filed renewed special exceptions. Plaintiff in the Texas action alleges a "maximum" of $125 million in total damages (after trebling). Because the Court has not rendered a decision on defendants' renewed special exceptions and discovery has not been completed, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the Texas action. In the Kansas action, defendants are appealing to the Kansas Supreme Court the trial court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. In the Kansas action, the plaintiff alleges damages in an amount "greater than $75,000" for each of the three claims directed against AIG in the complaint. Because the Kansas Supreme Court has not decided the appeal of the trial court's denial of defendants' motion to dismiss, a precise amount of damages has not been specified and discovery has not been completed, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, from the Kansas action.
    Workers' Compensation Premium Reporting.
    On May 24, 2007, the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), on behalf of the participating members of the National Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Pool (the NWCRP), filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois

(Northern District of Illinois) against AIG with respect to the underpayment by AIG of its residual market assessments for workers' compensation insurance. The complaint alleged claims for violations of RICO, breach of contract, fraud and related state law claims arising out of AIG's alleged underpayment of these assessments between 1970 and the present and sought damages purportedly in excess of $1 billion. On August 6, 2007, the Court denied AIG's motion seeking to dismiss or stay the complaint or, in the alternative, to transfer to the Southern District of New York. On December 26, 2007, the Court denied AIG's motion to dismiss the complaint.
    On March 17, 2008, AIG filed an amended answer, counterclaims and third-party claims against NCCI (in its capacity as attorney-in-fact for the NWCRP), the NWCRP, its board members, and certain of the other insurance companies that are members of the NWCRP alleging violations of RICO, as well as claims for conspiracy, fraud, and other state law claims. The counterclaim- defendants and third-party defendants filed motions to dismiss on June 9, 2008. On January 26, 2009, AIG filed a motion to dismiss all claims in the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On February 23, 2009, the Court issued a decision and order sustaining AIG's counterclaims and sustaining, in part, AIG's third-party claims. The Court also dismissed certain of AIG's third-party claims without prejudice.
    On April 13, 2009, third-party defendant Liberty Mutual Group (Liberty Mutual) filed third-party counterclaims against AIG, certain of its subsidiaries, and former AIG executives. On August 23, 2009, the Court granted AIG's motion to dismiss the NCCI complaint for lack of standing. On September 25, 2009, AIG filed its First Amended Complaint, reasserting its RICO claims against certain insurance companies that both underreported their workers' compensation premium and served on the NWCRP Board, and repleading its fraud and other state law claims. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint on October 30, 2009. On October 8, 2009, Liberty Mutual filed an amended counterclaim against AIG. The amended counterclaim is substantially similar to the complaint initially filed by NCCI, but also seeks damages related to non-NWCRP states, guaranty funds, and special assessments, in addition to asserting claims for other violations of state law. The amended counterclaim also removes as defendants the former AIG executives. On October 30, 2009, AIG filed a motion to dismiss the Liberty amended counterclaim.
    On April 1, 2009, Safeco Insurance Company of America (Safeco) and Ohio Casualty Insurance Company (Ohio Casualty) filed a complaint in the Northern District of Illinois, on behalf of a purported class of all NWCRP participant members, against AIG and certain of its subsidiaries with respect to the underpayment by AIG of its residual market assessments for workers' compensation insurance. The complaint was styled as an "alternative complaint," should the Court grant AIG's motion to dismiss the NCCI lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The allegations in the class action complaint are substantially similar to those filed by the NWCRP, but the complaint names former AIG executives as defendants and asserts a RICO claim against those executives. On August 28, 2009, the class action plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing the AIG executives as defendants. On October 30, 2009, AIG filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On July 16, 2010, Safeco and Ohio Casualty filed their motion for class certification, which AIG opposed on October 8, 2010.
    On July 1, 2010, the Court ruled on the pending motions to dismiss that were directed at all parties' claims. With respect to the underreporting NWCRP companies' and board members' motion to dismiss AIG's first amended complaint, the Court denied the motion to dismiss all counts except AIG's claim for unjust enrichment, which it found to be precluded by the surviving claims for breach of contract. With respect to NCCI and the NWCRP's motion to dismiss AIG's first amended complaint, the Court denied the NCCI and the NWCRP's motions to dismiss AIG's claims for an equitable accounting and an action on an open, mutual, and current account. With respect to AIG's motions to dismiss Liberty's counterclaims and the class action complaint, the Court denied both motions, except that it dismissed the class claim for promissory estoppel. On July 30, 2010, the NWCRP filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court's ruling denying its motion to dismiss AIG's claims for an equitable accounting and an action on an open, mutual, and current account. The Court denied the NWCRP's motion for reconsideration on September 16, 2010. The plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on July 16, 2010. AIG opposed the motion.

    On January 5, 2011, AIG executed a term sheet with a group of intervening plaintiffs, made up of seven participating members of the NWCRP that filed a motion to intervene in the class action for the purpose of settling the claims at issue on behalf of a settlement class. The proposed class-action settlement would require AIG to pay $450 million to satisfy all liabilities to the class members arising out of the workers' compensation premium reporting issues, a portion of which would be funded out of the remaining amount held in the Workers' Compensation Fund less any amounts previously withdrawn to satisfy AIG's regulatory settlement obligations, as addressed above. On January 13, 2011, their motion to intervene was granted. On January 19, 2011, the intervening class plaintiffs filed their Complaint in Intervention. On January 28, 2011, AIG and the intervening class plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement embodying the terms set forth in the January 5, 2011 term sheet and filed a joint motion for certification of the settlement class and preliminary approval of the settlement. If approved by the Court (and such approval becomes final), the settlement agreement will resolve and dismiss with prejudice all claims that have been made or that could have been made in the consolidated litigations pending in the Northern District of Illinois arising out of workers' compensation premium reporting, including the class action, other than claims that are brought by any class member that opts out of the settlement. On April 29, 2011, Liberty Mutual filed papers in opposition to preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and in opposition to certification of a settlement class, in which it alleged AIG's actual exposure, should the class action continue through judgment, to be in excess of $3 billion. AIG disputes and will defend against this allegation. The Court held a hearing on the motions for class certification and preliminary approval of the proposed class-action settlement on June 21 and July 25, 2011.
    On August 1, 2011, the Court issued an opinion and order granting the motion for class certification and preliminarily approving the proposed class-action settlement, subject to certain minor modifications that the Court noted the parties already had agreed to make. The opinion and order became effective upon the entry of a separate Findings and Order Preliminarily Certifying a Settlement Class and Preliminarily Approving Proposed Settlement on August 5, 2011. Liberty Mutual sought leave from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to appeal the August 5, 2011 class certification decision, which was denied on August 19, 2011. Notice of the settlement was issued to the class members on August 19, 2011 advising that any class member wishing to opt out of or object to the class  action settlement was required to do so by October 3, 2011. RLI Insurance Company and its affiliates, which were to receive less than one thousand dollars under the proposed settlement, sent the only purported opt-out notice. Liberty Mutual, including its subsidiaries Safeco and Ohio Casualty, and the Kemper group of insurance companies, through their affiliate Lumbermens Mutual Casualty, were the only two objectors. AIG and the settling class plaintiffs filed responses to the objectors' submissions on October 28, 2011. The Court conducted a final fairness hearing on November 29, 2011. On December 21, 2011, the Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement, but staying that ruling pending a forthcoming opinion. On January 19, 2012, Liberty Mutual and Safeco and Ohio Casualty filed notices of their intent to appeal the Court's order granting class-action settlement approval.
    The $450 million settlement amount, which is currently held in escrow pending final resolution of the class-action settlement, was funded in part from the approximately $191.5 million remaining in the Workers' Compensation Fund, after the transfer of the $146.5 million in fines, penalties, and premium taxes discussed in the NAIC Examination of Workers' Compensation Premium Reporting matter above into a separate escrow account pursuant to the regulatory settlement agreement. In the event that the proposed class action settlement is not approved, the litigation will resume. As of December 31, 2011, AIG has an accrued liability equal to the amounts payable under the settlement.

Litigation Matters Relating to AIG's Insurance Operations
    Caremark.
    AIG and certain of its subsidiaries have been named defendants in two putative class actions in state court in Alabama that arise out of the 1999 settlement of class and derivative litigation involving Caremark Rx, Inc. (Caremark). The plaintiffs in the second-filed action intervened in the first-filed action, and the second-filed action was dismissed. An excess policy issued by a subsidiary of AIG with respect to the 1999 litigation was expressly stated to be without limit of liability. In the current actions, plaintiffs allege that the judge approving the 1999 settlement was misled as to the extent of available insurance coverage and would not have approved the settlement had he known of the existence and/or unlimited nature of the excess policy. They further allege that AIG, its subsidiaries, and Caremark are liable for fraud and suppression for misrepresenting and/or concealing the nature and extent of coverage. In addition, the intervenors originally alleged that various lawyers and law firms who represented parties in the underlying class and derivative litigation (the Lawyer Defendants) were also liable for fraud and suppression, misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty.
    The complaints filed by the plaintiffs and the intervenors request compensatory damages for the 1999 class in the amount of $3.2 billion, plus punitive damages. AIG and its subsidiaries deny the allegations of fraud and suppression, assert that information concerning the excess policy was publicly disclosed months prior to the approval of the settlement, that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations, and that the statute cannot be tolled in light of the public disclosure of the excess coverage. The plaintiffs and intervenors, in turn, have asserted that the disclosure was insufficient to inform them of the nature of the coverage and did not start the running of the statute of limitations.
    In November 2007, the trial court dismissed the intervenors' complaint against the Lawyer Defendants, and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed that dismissal in September 2008. After the case was sent back down to the trial court, the intervenors retained additional counsel and filed an Amended Complaint in Intervention that named only Caremark and AIG and various subsidiaries as defendants, purported to bring claims against all defendants for deceit and conspiracy to deceive, and purported to bring a claim against AIG and its subsidiaries for aiding and abetting Caremark's alleged deception. The defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint in Intervention, and the plaintiffs moved to disqualify all of the lawyers for the intervenors because, among other things, the newly retained firm had previously represented Caremark. The intervenors, in turn, moved to disqualify the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the first-filed action. The cross-motions to disqualify were withdrawn after the two sets of plaintiffs agreed that counsel for the original plaintiffs would act as lead counsel, and intervenors also withdrew their Amended Complaint in Intervention. The trial court approved all of the foregoing steps and, in April 2009, established a schedule for class action discovery that was to lead to a hearing on class certification in March 2010. The Court has since appointed a special master to oversee class action discovery and has directed the parties to submit a new discovery schedule after certain discovery disputes are resolved. Class discovery is ongoing. A class certification hearing has been set for March 2012, but it is expected to be adjourned until later in the Spring.
    As of February 23, 2012, the parties have not completed class action discovery, general discovery has not commenced, and the court has not determined if a class action is appropriate or the size or scope of any class. As a result, AIG is unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation.

    AIG and its subsidiaries occupy leased space in many locations under various long-term leases and have entered into various leases covering the long-term use of data processing equipment.
The following table presents the future minimum lease payments under operating leases:
    Rent expense was $482 million, $587 million and $733 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts include $24 million, $118 million and $206 million attributable to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Other Commitments
    In the normal course of business, AIG enters into commitments to invest in private equity funds, hedge funds and mutual funds and to purchase and develop real estate in the U.S. and abroad. These commitments totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2011.
    AIG is obligated, subject to certain conditions, to make any payment that is not promptly paid with respect to the benefits accrued by certain employees of AIG and its subsidiaries under the SICO Plans (as discussed in (c) below under "Benefits Provided by Starr International Company, Inc.").

(C) CONTINGENCIES
Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense
    Although AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of the established Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense, there can be no assurance that AIG's loss reserves will not develop adversely and have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines of business, which include general liability, commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, D&O and products liability. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. There is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims, such as the effects that the recent disruption in the credit markets could have on reported claims under professional liability coverages.
Benefits Provided by Starr International Company, Inc.
    SICO has provided a series of two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans (SICO Plans) to certain AIG employees. The SICO Plans were created in 1975 when the voting shareholders and Board of Directors of SICO, a private holding company whose principal asset was AIG Common Stock, decided that a portion of the capital value of SICO should be used to provide an incentive plan for the current and succeeding managements of all American International companies, including AIG.
    None of the costs of the various benefits provided under the SICO Plans has been paid by AIG, although AIG has recorded a charge to reported earnings for the deferred compensation amounts paid to AIG employees by SICO, with an offsetting amount credited to Additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts considered to be contributed by SICO. The SICO Plans provide that shares currently owned by SICO are set aside by SICO for the benefit of the participant and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors currently may permit an early payout of units under certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is not entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, including but not limited to the participant's voluntary termination of employment with AIG prior to normal retirement age. Under the SICO Plans, SICO's Board of Directors may elect to pay a participant cash in lieu of shares of AIG Common Stock. Following notification from SICO to participants in the SICO Plans that it will settle specific future awards under the SICO Plans with shares rather than cash, AIG modified its accounting for the SICO Plans from variable to fixed measurement accounting. AIG gave effect to this change in settlement method beginning on December 9, 2005, the date of SICO's notice to participants in the SICO Plans.
    Under the Starr International Company, Inc. Assurance Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2005 (SICO Assurance Agreement), AIG has agreed that, in the event that SICO does not promptly deliver the shares as required under the express terms of the SICO Plans to participants who were employees of AIG and its subsidiaries as of May 18, 2005, AIG will pay the benefits due under the SICO Plans. At December 31, 2011, the maximum number of shares of AIG Common Stock that AIG could be required to deliver under the SICO Assurance Agreement was 195,908.

(D) GUARANTEES
Subsidiaries
    AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIGFP arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP.
    In connection with AIGFP's leasing business, AIGFP has issued, in a limited number of transactions, standby letters of credit or similar facilities to equity investors in an amount equal to the termination value owing to the equity investor by the lessee in the event of a lessee default (the equity termination value). The total amount outstanding at December 31, 2011 was $437 million. In those transactions, AIGFP has agreed to pay such amount if the lessee fails to pay. The amount payable by AIGFP is, in certain cases, partially offset by amounts payable under other instruments typically equal to the present value of a scheduled payment to be made by AIGFP. In the event that AIGFP is required to make a payment to the equity investor, the lessee is unconditionally obligated to reimburse AIGFP. To the extent that the equity investor is paid the equity termination value from the standby letter of credit and/or other sources, including payments by the lessee, AIGFP takes an assignment of the equity investor's rights under the lease of the underlying property. Because the obligations of the lessee under the lease transactions are generally economically defeased, lessee bankruptcy is the most likely circumstance in which AIGFP would be required to pay.
Asset Dispositions
General
    AIG is subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with the completed sales of businesses pursuant to its asset disposition plan. The various arrangements may be triggered by, among other things, declines in asset values, the occurrence of specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, developments in litigation or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by AIG. These arrangements are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or are not applicable.
    AIG is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under certain of these arrangements. Overall, AIG believes that it is unlikely it will have to make any material payments related to completed sales under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Notes 1 and 4 herein for additional information on sales of businesses and asset dispositions.
ALICO Sale
    Pursuant to the terms of the ALICO stock purchase agreement, AIG has agreed to provide MetLife with certain indemnities, the most significant of which include:
 - 
Indemnification related to breaches of general representations and warranties with an aggregate deductible of $125 million and a maximum payout of $2.25 billion. The indemnification extends for 21 months after November 1, 2010.
 - 
Indemnifications related to specific product, investment, litigation and other matters that are excluded from the general representations and warranties indemnity. These indemnifications provide for various deductible amounts, which in certain cases are zero, and maximum exposures, which in certain cases are unlimited, and extend for various periods after the completion of the sale.
188            AIG Form 8-K
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 - 
Tax indemnifications related to insurance reserves that extend for taxable periods ending on or before December 31, 2013 and that are limited to an aggregate of $200 million, and certain other tax-related representations and warranties that extend to the expiration of the statute of limitations and are subject to an aggregate deductible of $50 million.
 - 
Indemnification for taxes incurred by ALICO as a result of the proposed elections under Section 338 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Such elections have the effect of shifting the federal income tax liability on the sale from the seller to ALICO. On March 8, 2011, AIG paid MetLife approximately $300 million related to this indemnity.
    In connection with the indemnity obligations described above, as of December 31, 2011, approximately $1.6 billion of proceeds from the ALICO Sale were on deposit in an escrow arrangement. The amount required to be held in escrow declines to zero in April 2013, with claims submitted related to the indemnifications reducing the amount that can be released to AIG. Escrow releases to AIG are generally required to be applied towards the reduction of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests. The escrow arrangement, as of December 31, 2011, consists of $3.0 billion of initial cash proceeds from the sale of MetLife securities received upon the completion of the ALICO Sale, less the following payments to MetLife from the escrow account in connection with the indemnification for various claims under the terms of the ALICO Sale: (i) approximately $300 million for taxes as described above and (ii) approximately $150 million during 2011 in connection with the previously disclosed litigation relating to Italian internal fund suspensions, U.K. internal fund suspensions, and various tax and other indemnity claims. On November 1, 2011, in accordance with the MetLife escrow agreement from the ALICO Sale, approximately $918 million was released to AIG. These proceeds were applied to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the Department of the Treasury's AIA SPV Preferred Interests pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2010, among AIG, the SPVs, the FRBNY, the Department of the Treasury and the Trust.
AGF Sale
    On November 30, 2010, AIG completed the sale of AGF. In accordance with the terms of the sale, AIG has made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants in the stock purchase agreement in which AIG agreed to provide the purchaser with certain indemnities.
AIG Star and AIG Edison Sale
    Pursuant to the terms of the AIG Star and AIG Edison stock purchase agreement, AIG has agreed to provide Prudential Financial, Inc. with certain indemnities, the most significant of which is indemnification related to breaches of general representations and warranties that result in losses that exceed 4.1 billion Yen ($53 million at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate), with a maximum payout of 102 billion Yen ($1.3 billion at the December 31, 2011 exchange rate). Except for certain specified representations and warranties that may have a longer survival period, the indemnification extends until November 1, 2012.

COMMON STOCK
AIG Treasury Stock Retirement
    On November 30, 2009, AIG retired 6,111,158 common shares included in Treasury stock, which had a carrying value of $7.4 billion. These shares were returned to AIG's authorized but unissued common stock. AIG accounted for the retirement by reducing common stock by $15 million and Additional paid-in capital by $7.4 billion.
Dividends
    Following the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011, and pursuant to the terms of the Series G Preferred Stock, AIG was not able to declare or pay any cash dividends on the AIG Common Stock while the Series G Preferred Stock was outstanding. In addition, AIG was unable to pay dividends under the terms of other series of AIG preferred stock that were outstanding from November 2008 through January 14, 2011.
    The Series G Preferred Stock was cancelled in connection with AIG's public offering of AIG Common Stock in May 2011. After the cancellation of the Series G Preferred Stock, there have been no contractual restrictions on AIG's ability to pay dividends.
    Any payment of dividends will require the approval of AIG's Board of Directors (the Board), in its discretion, from funds legally available therefor. The Board may consider AIG's financial position, the performance of its businesses, its consolidated financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, available capital, the existence of investment opportunities and other factors in determining the payment of dividends, if any.
Share Issuances and Repurchases
May 2011 Common Stock Offering and Sale
    On May 27, 2011, AIG and the Department of the Treasury, as the selling shareholder, completed a registered public offering of AIG Common Stock. AIG issued and sold 100 million shares of AIG Common Stock for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $2.9 billion and the Department of the Treasury sold 200 million shares of AIG Common Stock. AIG did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of AIG Common Stock by the Department of the Treasury. Of the net proceeds AIG received from this offering, $550 million was used to fund the Consolidated 2004 Securities Litigation settlement (see Note 16 herein). As required by the Registration Rights Agreement, AIG paid the underwriting discount as well as certain expenses with respect to the

shares sold by the Department of the Treasury. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. As a result of the sale of AIG Common Stock in this offering, the Series G Drawdown Right was terminated, the Series G Preferred Stock was cancelled and the ownership by the Department of the Treasury was reduced from approximately 92 percent to approximately 77 percent of the AIG Common Stock outstanding after the completion of the offering.
Repurchases
    In November 2011, AIG's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of AIG Common Stock, with an aggregate purchase amount of up to $1 billion from time to time in the open market, through derivative or automatic purchase contracts or otherwise. This authorization replaces all prior Common Stock repurchase authorizations.
    AIG repurchased a total of 3,074,031 shares of AIG Common Stock for approximately $70 million in 2011. The timing of additional repurchases will depend on market conditions, AIG's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, rating agency considerations and other factors.
Equity Units
    In May 2008, AIG sold 78.4 million equity units (the Equity Units) at a price per unit of $75 for gross proceeds of $5.88 billion. The Equity Units included a stock purchase contract obligating the holder of an Equity Unit to purchase, and obligating AIG to sell, a variable number of shares of AIG Common Stock for $25 in cash.
    AIG was obligated to pay quarterly contract adjustment payments to the holders of the stock purchase contracts under the Equity Units, at an initial annual rate of 2.71 percent applied to the stated amount. The present value of the contract adjustment payments, $431 million, was recognized at inception as a liability (a component of Other liabilities), and was recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital.
    In addition to the stock purchase contracts, as part of the Equity Units, AIG issued $1.96 billion of each of the Series B-1, B-2 and B-3 junior subordinated debentures, which initially paid interest at rates of 5.67 percent, 5.82 percent and 5.89 percent, respectively.
    The junior subordinated debentures were recorded as Other long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The principal amount owed by AIG on the subordinated debentures was equal to the amount owed to AIG under the related stock purchase contract.
    On November 23, 2010, AIG commenced an offer to exchange up to 74,480,000 of its Equity Units for consideration per Equity Unit equal to 0.09867 share of AIG Common Stock plus $3.2702 in cash (the Exchange Offer). The stock and cash received was the result of netting payments from two separate transactions, a repurchase of the subordinated debentures and a cancellation of the stock purchase contracts.
    On November 29, 2010, holders of 49,474,600 Equity Units accepted the Exchange Offer and their units were tendered in exchange for 4,881,667 shares of AIG Common Stock and $162 million in cash. Following the completion of the exchange offer, a total of 28,925,400 Equity Units remained outstanding. The execution of the Exchange Offer resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of the subordinated debentures of approximately $104 million and an increase to equity of approximately $3.7 billion.
    In 2011, AIG remarketed the three series of debentures included in the Equity Units. AIG purchased and retired all of the Series B-1, B-2 and B-3 Debentures representing $2.2 billion in aggregate principal and as a result, no Series B-1, B-2 or B-3 Debentures remain outstanding. As of December 31, 2011, AIG had issued approximately 1.8 billion shares of AIG Common Stock in connection with the settlement of the stock purchase contracts underlying its Equity Units.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
    In connection with the execution of its orderly asset disposition plan, as well as the repayment of the FRBNY Credit Facility, AIG transferred two of its wholly-owned businesses, AIA and ALICO, to two newly created SPVs in exchange for all the common and preferred interests of those SPVs. On December 1, 2009, AIG transferred the preferred interests in the SPVs to the FRBNY in consideration for a $25 billion reduction of the outstanding loan balance and of the maximum amount of credit available under the FRBNY Credit Facility and amended the terms of the FRBNY Credit Facility. As part of the closing of the Recapitalization, the remaining preferred interests, with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $20.3 billion at January 14, 2011, were purchased from the FRBNY by AIG and transferred to the Department of the Treasury as part of the consideration for the exchange of the Series F Preferred Stock. Under the terms of the SPVs' limited liability company agreements, the SPVs generally may not distribute funds to AIG until the liquidation preferences and preferred returns on the preferred interests have been repaid in full and concurrent distributions have been made on certain participating returns attributable to the preferred interests.
    The common interests, which were retained by AIG, entitle AIG to 100 percent of the voting power of the SPVs. The voting power allows AIG to elect the boards of managers of the SPVs, who oversee the management and operation of the SPVs. Primarily due to the substantive participation rights of the preferred interests, the SPVs were determined to be variable interest entities. As the primary beneficiary of the SPVs, AIG consolidates the SPVs.
    The rights originally held by the FRBNY through its ownership of the SPV Preferred Interests are now held by the Department of the Treasury. In connection with the Recapitalization, AIG agreed to cause the proceeds of certain asset dispositions to be used to pay down the remaining SPV Preferred Interests.
    For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Noncontrolling interests balance declined by $2.2 billion and $4.4 billion. In 2009, this decline reflected the deconsolidation of Transatlantic in the second quarter of 2009 following the public offering of 29.9 million shares of Transatlantic common stock, after which AIG retained 13.9 percent of Transatlantic common stock outstanding. AIG also restructured certain relationships within the Institutional Asset Management business in 2009, resulting in the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and a related decline in goodwill of $476 million and noncontrolling interests of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, due to the deconsolidation of certain entities.
    As a result of the closing of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011, the SPV Preferred Interests held by the Department of the Treasury are not considered permanent equity on AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and were classified as redeemable non-controlling interests. As part of the Recapitalization, AIG used approximately $6.1 billion of the cash proceeds from the sale of ALICO to pay down a portion of the liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests. The liquidation preference of the SPV Preferred Interests was further reduced by approximately $12.4 billion using proceeds from the sale of AIG Star, AIG Edison, Nan Shan, and MetLife securities received in the sale of ALICO. During the first quarter of 2011, the remaining liquidation preference of the Preferred Interests in the ALICO SPV was paid in full. See Note 16(d) herein for a discussion of indemnity payments made to MetLife pursuant to the terms of the ALICO stock purchase agreement.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS)
    Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings per share is based on those shares used in basic EPS plus shares that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding, adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. Basic earnings (loss) per share was not affected by outstanding stock purchase contracts. Diluted earnings per share is determined considering the potential dilution from outstanding stock purchase contracts using the treasury stock method and was not affected by the previously outstanding stock purchase contracts because they were not dilutive.
    In connection with the issuance of the Series C Preferred Stock, AIG applied the two-class method for calculating EPS. The two-class method is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS when a company's capital structure includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities. This method determines EPS based on dividends declared on common stock and participating securities (i.e., distributed earnings) as well as participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings. The Series C Preferred Stock was retired as part of the Recapitalization on January 14, 2011.
    AIG applied the two-class method due to the participation rights of the Series C Preferred Stock through January 14, 2011. However, application of the two-class method had no effect on earnings per share for 2011 because AIG recognized a net loss attributable to AIG common shareholders from continuing operations, which is not applicable to participating stock for EPS, for 2011. Subsequent to January 14, 2011, AIG did not have any outstanding participating securities that subjected AIG to the two-class method.

Dilutive shares are calculated using the treasury stock method and include dilutive shares from share-based employee compensation plans, and the warrants issued to the Department of the Treasury in 2009, and warrants issued to the shareholders in January 2011. The number of shares excluded from diluted shares outstanding were 76 million, 11 million and 12 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
    Deemed dividends represent the excess of (i) the fair value of the consideration transferred to the Department of the Treasury, which consists of 1,092,169,866 shares of AIG Common Stock, $20.2 billion of redeemable SPV Preferred Interests, and a liability for a commitment by AIG to pay the Department of the Treasury's costs to dispose of all of its shares, over (ii) the carrying value of the Series E and F Preferred Stock.

AIG Common Stock issued for the Series C Preferred Stock over the carrying value of the Series C Preferred Stock is not a deemed dividend because the Series C Preferred Stock was contingently convertible into the 562,868,096 shares of AIG Common Stock for which it was exchanged. See Note 1 herein for further discussion of shares exchanged in connection with the Recapitalization.
18. STATUTORY FINANCIAL DATA AND RESTRICTIONS
The following table presents statutory surplus and net income (loss) for AIG's general insurance and life insurance and retirement services operations in accordance with statutory accounting practices:
(a)
Excludes discontinued operations and other divested businesses. Statutory surplus and net income (loss) with respect to foreign operations are estimated at November 30.
(b)
The 2010 amount was increased by $310 million from that previously reported as a result of the finalization of statutory filings.
(c)
Includes catastrophe losses (General Insurance) and Net realized capital gains and losses.
(d)
Amount subject to change based on final statutory filings.
    AIG's insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities. The principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for domestic companies are that statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, investment impairments are determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are generally valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.
    At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, statutory capital of AIG's insurance subsidiaries exceeded minimum company action level requirements.
EFFECT OF NEW STANDARDS
    Effective January 1, 2009, these domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services insurance entities, as well as certain other AIG insurance entities were initially required to prospectively adopt Statements of Statutory Accounting Principles (SSAP) No. 98, "Treatment of Cash Flows When Quantifying Changes in Valuation and Impairments, an Amendment of SSAP No. 43  Loan-backed and Structured Securities" (SSAP 98). However, in the first quarter of 2009, the NAIC subsequently delayed the effective date of SSAP No. 98 until September 30, 2009, in consideration of the FASB's issuance of a new other-than-temporary accounting standard. The NAIC subsequently promulgated SSAP 43R (Revised) 
Loan-backed and Structured Securities
, which was effective for the third quarter of 2009 and superseded SSAP No. 43 and also SSAP No. 98, prior to its delayed effective date. Similar to the new other-than-temporary accounting standard, SSAP No. 43R requires that credit-related other-than-temporary impairments of structured securities be measured based upon projected discounted cash flows. SunAmerica insurance entities recognized a cumulative effect adjustment upon the adoption of SSAP No. 43R that on a pre-tax basis increased regulatory capital by approximately $0.9 billion.

SUBSIDIARY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS
    Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to AIG's domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. For example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders that, in any 12-month period, exceed the lesser of ten percent of such company's statutory policyholders' surplus or 100 percent of its "adjusted net investment income," as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both general and life insurance companies exist in most of the other states in which AIG's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may restrict the ability of AIG's foreign insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.
    There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of these restrictions, approximately 89 percent of the aggregate equity of AIG's consolidated insurance operations was restricted from transfer to AIG Parent at December 31, 2011. AIG cannot predict how regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.
    To AIG's knowledge, no AIG insurance company is currently on any regulatory or similar "watch list" with regard to solvency.
19. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER PLANS
    AIG's Consolidated Statement of Operations included share-based compensation expense as follows:
*
As of December 31, 2011, compensation expense for the majority of AIG's outstanding share-based awards is attributed to liability-classified awards, the value of which are based on AIG's share price at the reporting date. AIG's share price was $23.20 and $57.62 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and is the primary driver of the $349 million decrease in share-based compensation expense recognized in 2011 compared to 2010. Includes pre-tax share-based compensation expense related to discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $12 million ($9 million after tax), and $21 million ($13 million after tax), respectively.
EMPLOYEE PLANS
    AIG employees are granted awards under the AIG 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (2010 Plan), under which AIG has issued restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock appreciation rights (SARs). The 2010 Plan supersedes all Plans for which share-based awards remain outstanding and is currently the only plan under which share-based awards can be issued.
    However, awards granted under the following employee compensation plans remain outstanding at December 31, 2011:
 - 
AIG 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended (1999 Plan) (superseded by the 2007 Plan);
 - 
AIG 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (2002 Plan), under which AIG has issued performance restricted stock units (performance RSUs) (superseded by the 2007 Plan);

 - 
SICO's Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans (SICO Plans).
    Share option exercises and other share awards to participants were settled by issuing previously acquired shares held in AIG's treasury account through November 30, 2009. Effective December 1, 2009, AIG is settling its share-settled awards with newly-issued shares of AIG Common Stock. Share awards made by SICO are settled by SICO.
NON-EMPLOYEE PLANS
    AIG's non-employee directors received share-based compensation in the form of deferred stock units (DSUs) under the 2010 Plan with delivery deferred until retirement from the Board. In 2011 and 2010, AIG granted to directors 21,203 and 14,484 DSUs, respectively.
STOCK OPTIONS
AIG Stock Option Plan
    Options granted under the 2007 Plan and the 1999 Plan remain outstanding at December 31, 2011. These awards generally vested over four years (25 percent vesting per year) and expire 10 years from the date of grant. There were no stock options granted since 2008; however, in 2011, AIG issued 506 shares in connection with previous exercises of options with delivery deferred.
The following table provides a roll forward of stock option activity:
    The aggregate intrinsic value for all outstanding option is zero. At December 31, 2011, no unrecognized compensation costs remain for outstanding stock options under these plans.
OTHER SHARE-SETTLED AWARDS UNDER SHARE-BASED PLANS
AIG 2010 Stock Incentive Plan
    The 2010 Plan was adopted at the 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The total number of shares of common stock that may be granted under the Plan is 60,000,000 (the reserve). During 2011, AIG granted DSUs, RSUs, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights under the 2010 Plan. Each RSU, DSU and share of restricted stock awarded reduces the number of shares available for future grants by one share. The reserve is also reduced for the issuance of cash-settled share-based awards regardless of the form in which the award is originally granted. At December 31, 2011, a total of 31,287,400 shares remained in reserve for future grants under the 2010 Plan.
    In December 2011 and 2010, AIG granted 1,135,166 and 587,681, respectively, fully-vested shares of non-transferable AIG Common Stock (restricted stock) under the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan to certain of AIG's

most highly compensated employees and executive officers. The restricted stock generally becomes transferable in March of the second year following grant or on the second or third anniversary of grant in accordance with the terms of the employee's award.
AIG 2007 Stock Incentive Plan
    The 2007 Plan was adopted at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The 2010 Plan superseded the 2007 Plan, therefore, there were no grants made under the 2007 Plan subsequent to May 11, 2010. During 2010, 114,521 time-vested RSUs were granted under the 2007 Plan and will vest on the second or the third anniversary of the date of grant.
    In 2010, a total of 118,605 fully-vested shares of non-transferable AIG Common Stock (restricted stock) were granted to certain of AIG's most highly compensated employees and executive officers under the 2007 Plan. Of such restricted shares, 39,535 became transferable in March 2011 and the remaining restricted stock will become transferable on the second or third anniversary of grant in accordance with the terms of the employee's award.
AIG 2002 Stock Incentive Plan
    The 2002 Plan was adopted in 2002 and superseded by the 2007 Plan. Only the AIG 2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan (DCPPP) and the AIG Partners Plan, which provide share-based compensation to key AIG employees including senior executive officers, remained outstanding under the 2002 Plan at December 31, 2011. Participants in these plans were awarded RSUs if certain market or performance measures were met over a specified period of time as determined by AIG's Compensation and Management Resources Committee. The RSUs awarded under the DCPPP and the AIG Partners Plan vested in three and two installments, respectively, with the final installments vesting in January 2012; at December 31, 2011, a total of 34,126 and 19,950 RSUs in the respective plans remained outstanding, all of which vested and were settled by the net issuance of AIG Common Stock in January 2012.
SICO Plans
    The SICO Plans provide that shares of AIG Common Stock currently held by SICO are set aside for the benefit of the participant and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors currently may permit an early payout of shares under certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is not entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, including but not limited to the participant's termination of employment with AIG prior to normal retirement age. A significant portion of the awards under the SICO Plans vest the year after the participant reaches age 65, provided that the participant remains employed by AIG through age 65. The portion of the awards for which early payout is available vest on the applicable payout date.
    Although none of the costs of the various benefits provided under the SICO Plans have been paid by AIG, AIG has recorded compensation expense for the deferred compensation amounts payable to AIG employees by SICO, with an offsetting amount credited to Additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO.
    The SICO Plans are also described in Note 16 herein.

Excludes DSUs and options, which are discussed under the Non-Employee Plans and Stock Options sections above.
    The total unrecognized compensation cost (net of expected forfeitures) related to unvested SICO awards is $71 million and the weighted-average and expected period of years over which those costs are expected to be recognized are 5.41 years and 28 years, respectively. The unrecognized expense for all other awards total $1 million, with a weighted average period of less than one year.
LIABILITY AWARDS
    AIG has issued various share-based grants, including restricted stock units, linked to AIG Common Stock, but providing for cash settlement to certain of its most highly compensated employees and executive officers. Share-based cash settled awards are recorded as liabilities until the final payout is made or the award is replaced with a stock-settled award. Unlike stock-settled awards, which have a fixed grant-date fair value (unless the award is subsequently modified), the fair value of unsettled or unvested liability awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one share of AIG Common Stock. The liability and corresponding expense are adjusted accordingly until the award is settled.
Stock Salary Awards
    In 2009, AIG established a program of regular grants of vested stock or units that is generally referred to as "Stock Salary". Stock Salary is determined as a dollar amount through the date that salary is earned and accrued at the same time or times as the salary would otherwise be paid in cash. Stock Salary was granted to any individual qualifying as a senior executive officer or one of AIG's next twenty most highly compensated employees (the Top 25). Stock Salary for a Top 25 employee (other than AIG's CEO) is settled in three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of grant. Stock Salary was also granted to individuals qualifying as an executive officer or one of AIG's next 75 most highly compensated employees (Top 26-100), and will be settled on either the first or third anniversary of grant in accordance with the terms of an employee's award. The Stock Salary grants issued in 2009 were awarded in the form of immediately vested RSUs, and the number of units awarded was based on the value of AIG Common Stock on the grant date. The RSUs are settled in cash based on the value of AIG Common Stock on the applicable settlement date. During 2011 and 2010, AIG paid $6 million and $18 million to settle awards and recognized a reduction of $39 million and a charge of $36 million in compensation expense in the respective years for unsettled awards to reflect fluctuations in the price of AIG Common Stock.
AIG Form 8-K            203
American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    In 2010, AIG adopted the Long-Term Performance Units Plan (LTPU) and awarded Stock Salary in the form of LTPUs. The units were fully vested on the date of grant and settlement terms are substantially the same as the 2009 Stock Salary awards. Each unit was measured based on the underlying value of a mix of AIG hybrid securities and AIG Common Stock weighted 80 percent and 20 percent, respectively, and both components were market observable. Pursuant to their terms, as a result of the Recapitalization with the Department of the Treasury, the AIG hybrid securities portion of all outstanding LTPUs was converted into AIG Common Stock based on the values of such securities and AIG Common Stock on April 14, 2011, the time of the conversion; thereafter, the value of any unsettled 2010 Stock Salary award was based solely on AIG Common Stock. During 2011, AIG paid $29 million to settle the 2010 Stock Salary awards. AIG also recognized a reduction of $37 million and a charge of $156 million in compensation expense in 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to this plan.
    The terms of the 2011 Stock Salary awards for the Top 25 and the Top 26-100 are substantially the same as the 2009 Stock Salary awards, except that the awards to the Top 26-100 will be settled on the first anniversary of the respective grants. AIG recognized compensation expense of $75 million for fully vested unsettled awards as of December 31, 2011, which reflects fluctuations in the price of AIG Common Stock during 2011.
Restricted Stock Units
TARP RSUs
    TARP RSUs awarded require the achievement of objective performance metrics as a condition to entitlement. TARP RSUs granted to the Top 25 (other than AIG's CEO) vest on the third anniversary of grant, while TARP RSUs granted to the Top 26-100 vest on the second anniversary of grant and are subject to transferability restrictions for an additional year after vesting. When vested and transferable, an award will be settled in 25 percent installments in proportion to AIG's repayment of its TARP obligations.
Other RSUs
    Fully-vested RSUs totaling 271,131 were issued in March 2011 to certain employees in the Top 26-100 based on 2010 performance. Similarly, 301,645 fully vested RSUs were issued in March 2010 for performance in 2009. The RSUs for both awards will be cash-settled in March 2014 and 2013 for the 2010 and 2009 grants, respectively, based on the value of AIG Common Stock on each settlement date. AIG recorded expense of $8 million and $9 million in December 2010 and December 2009, respectively, when the awards were initially granted.
Long Term Incentive Plans
    In 2009, AIG established the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) under which middle management employees were offered the opportunity to receive additional compensation in the form of cash and SARs if certain performance metrics are met. The SARs component was added to the 2009 LTIP with the adoption of AIG's 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2010 LTIP) in March 2010. The ultimate value of LTIP awards is contingent on the achievement of performance measures aligned to the participant's business unit over a two-year period and such value could range from zero to twice the target amount. Subsequent to the performance period, the earned awards are subject to an additional time-vesting period. This results in a graded vesting schedule for the cash portion of up to two years, while the SARs portion cliff-vests two years after the performance period ends. The strike price for the majority of SARs, which is based on AIG's average share price over the 30-day period prior to the March grant date, was $37.40 for SARs issued under the 2011 LTIP. On January 19, 2011, the previous strike price of $31.91 for SARs issued under both the 2010 LTIP and the 2009 LTIP was adjusted to $26.97 pursuant to anti-dilution provisions of the LTIP due to the issuance of warrants in connection with the Recapitalization (see Note 1 for additional discussion). The cash portion of the awards expensed in 2011 and 2010 totaled approximately $199 million and $258 million, respectively. AIG recognizes compensation expense over the respective vesting periods for these plans.

    AIG uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach, which incorporates a range of input parameters that is consistently applied, to determine the fair value of SARs awards at each reporting period. The table below presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of SARs on December 31, 2011.
(a)
The dividend yield is estimated at zero percent given AIG's recent dividend history. See Note 17 herein for additional information.
(b)
The expected volatilities are the implied volatilities with the nearest maturity and strike as of valuation date from actively traded stock options on AIG Common Stock.
(c)
The risk-free interest rate is the continuously compounded interest rate for the term between the valuation date and maturity date that is assumed to be constant and equal to the interpolated value between the closest data points on the USD LIBOR-Swap curve as of valuation date.
(d)
The term to maturity is specified in the contract of each SARs grant.

20. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
PENSION PLANS
    AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies offer various defined benefit plans to eligible employees based on years of service.
    AIG's U.S. qualified retirement plan is a noncontributory defined benefit plan which is subject to the provisions of ERISA. U.S. salaried employees who are employed by a participating company, have attained age 21 and completed 12 months of continuous service are eligible to participate in the plan. Employees generally vest after five years of service. Unreduced benefits are paid to retirees at normal retirement (age 65) and are based upon a percentage of final average compensation multiplied by years of credited service, up to 44 years. Non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally either based on the employee's years of credited service and compensation in the years preceding retirement or on points accumulated based on the employee's job grade and other factors during each year of service.
    AIG also sponsors several non-qualified unfunded defined benefit plans for certain employees, including key executives, designed to supplement pension benefits provided by AIG's other retirement plans. These include the AIG Excess Retirement Income Plan (Excess), which provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable to certain employees under the AIG U.S. qualified retirement plan as a result of federal tax limitations on compensation and benefits payable and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental), which provides additional retirement benefits to designated executives. Under the Supplemental plan, an annual benefit accrues at a percentage of final average pay multiplied by each year of credited service, not greater than 60 percent of final average pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and any predecessor retirement plans (including the Excess Plan and any comparable plans), Social Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior employers. AIG has complied with the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation's mandate to suspend future benefits in the non-qualified retirement plans for the Top 100 most highly compensated employees of AIG. The impact to AIG's financial statements was not significant.
    Effective April 1, 2012, the AIG Retirement and AIG Excess Plans will be converted from final average pay to cash balance formulas comprised of pay credits based on 6 percent of a plan participant's annual compensation (subject to IRS limitations for the qualified plan) and annual interest credits. However, employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered under the final average pay formula in the respective plans.
POSTRETIREMENT PLANS
    AIG and its subsidiaries also provide postretirement medical care and life insurance benefits in the U.S. and in certain non-U.S. countries. Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon completion of a specified period of eligible service and attaining a specified age. Overseas, benefits vary by geographic location.
    U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service. Medical benefits are contributory, while the life insurance benefits are generally non-contributory. Retiree medical contributions vary from requiring no cost for pre-1989 retirees to requiring actual premium payments reduced by certain credits for post-1993 retirees. These contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and, Medicare coordination. Effective April 1, 2012, the retiree medical employer subsidy for the AIG Postretirement plan will be eliminated for certain employees.

The following table presents the funded status of the plans, reconciled to the amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The measurement date for most of the non-U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is November 30, consistent with the fiscal year end of the sponsoring companies. For all other plans, measurement occurs as of December 31.
(a)
AIG does not currently fund postretirement benefits.
(b)
Includes unfunded plans for which the aggregate pension benefit obligation was $267 million and $627 million at December 2011 and 2010, respectively. For 2011 and 2010, approximately 32 percent and 72 percent pertain to Japanese plans, which are not required by local regulation to be funded. The projected benefit obligation for these plans total $86 million and $454 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily attributed to the AIG Star and AIG Edison divestiture.
(c)
Includes non-qualified unfunded plans, for which the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $210 million and $219 million at December 2011 and 2010, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    At December 31, 2011, the funded status for the Non-U.S. pension plans was reduced by $614 million from December 31, 2010 primarily due to the divestitures of AIG Star, AIG Edison and Nan Shan, which are included in Dispositions in the table above.
The following table presents the accumulated benefit obligations for non-U.S. and U.S. pension benefit plans:
Defined benefit pension plan obligations in which the projected benefit obligation was in excess of the related plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation was in excess of the related plan assets were as follows:

American International Group, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    The estimated net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $130 million and $38 million, respectively, for AIG's combined defined benefit pension plans. For the defined benefit postretirement plans, the estimated amortization from Accumulated other comprehensive income for net loss and prior service credit that will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year will be less than $11 million in the aggregate.
    The annual pension expense in 2012 for the AIG U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is expected to be approximately $273 million. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or expected long-term rate of return would decrease the 2012 expense by approximately $82 million and $40 million, respectively, with all other items remaining the same. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate or expected long-term rate of return would increase the 2012 expense by approximately $87 million and $40 million, respectively, with all other items remaining the same.
ASSUMPTIONS
The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations:
(a)
The non-U.S. plans reflect those assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic environments of each of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.
(b)
Due to plan amendments effective in 2012, the AIG Retirement, Excess and Postretirement Plans were remeasured at September 30, 2011 using the following discount rates 4.5, 4.25 and 4.5 percents, respectively,
The following table summarizes assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. plans:
*
Increase in ultimate trend rate is based on the current expectation of future increases in medical and prescription drug costs.
A one percent point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the following effect on AIG's postretirement benefit obligations:
    AIG's postretirement plans provide benefits primarily in the form of defined employer contributions rather than defined employer benefits. Changes in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate are subject to caps for U.S. plans. AIG's non-U.S. postretirement plans are not subject to caps.

The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit costs:
(a)
The non-U.S. plans reflect those assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic environments of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.
(b)
As a result of plan amendments effective April 1, 2012, the AIG Retirement and AIG Excess Plans were remeasured utilizing a discount rate of 4.5 and 4.25 percent, respectively at September 30, 2011.
(c)
As a result of a plan amendment effective April 1, 2012, the AIG Postretirement Plan was remeasured utilizing a discount rate of 4.5 percent at September 30, 2011.
Discount Rate Methodology
    The projected benefit cash flows under the U.S. AIG Retirement plan were discounted using the spot rates derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve at December 31, 2011 and the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rounded to the nearest 25 basis points at December 31, 2010, which resulted in a single discount rate that would produce the same liability at the respective measurement dates. The discount rates were 4.62 percent at December 31, 2011 and 5.5 percent at December 31, 2010. Each methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. plans.
    In general, the discount rates for non-U.S. pension plans were developed based on the duration of liabilities on a plan by plan basis and were selected by reference to high quality corporate bonds in developed markets or local government bonds where developed markets are not as robust or nonexistent.
    The projected benefit obligation for Japan represents approximately 62 and 76 percent of the total projected benefit obligations for AIG's non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of 1.70 and 1.50 percent for Japan was selected by reference to the AA rated corporate bonds reported by Rating and Investment Information, Inc. in 2011 and Moody's/S&P in 2010 based on the duration of the plans' liabilities.
Plan Assets
    The investment strategy with respect to assets relating to AIG's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will (a) provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term; (b) limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls; and (c) maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, diversification and concentration, and the risk and rewards profile indigenous to each asset class.
    There were no shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2011 or 2010.

U.S. Pension Plans
    The long-term strategic asset allocation is reviewed and revised approximately every three years. The plans' assets are monitored by the investment committee of AIG's Retirement Board and the investment managers, which can entail allocating the plans assets among approved asset classes within pre-approved ranges permitted by the strategic allocation.
The following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for U.S. pension plans and the target allocation:
    The expected long-term rate of return for the plan was 7.5 and 7.75 percent for 2011 and 2010, respectively. The expected rate of return is an aggregation of expected returns within each asset class category. The expected asset return and any contributions made by AIG together are expected to maintain the plans' ability to meet all required benefit obligations. The expected asset return with respect to each asset class was developed based on a building block approach that considers historical returns, current market conditions, asset volatility and the expectations for future market returns. While the assessment of the expected rate of return is long-term and thus not expected to change annually, significant changes in investment strategy or economic conditions may warrant such a change. The expected asset return and any contributions made by AIG together are expected to maintain the plan's ability to meet all required benefit obligations.
Non-U.S. Pension Plans
    The assets of the non-U.S. pension plans are held in various trusts in multiple countries and are invested primarily in equities and fixed maturity securities to maximize the long-term return on assets for a given level of risk.
The following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for Non-U.S. pension plans and the target allocation:
    The expected weighted average long-term rates of return for the non-U.S. pension plans was 3.14 and 3.75 percent for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The expected rate of return for each country is an aggregation of expected returns within each asset class for such country. For each country, the return with respect to each asset class was developed based on a building block approach that considers historical returns, current market conditions, asset volatility and the expectations for future market returns. While the assessment of the expected rate of return is long-term and not expected to change annually, significant changes in

ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE
    AIG is required to disclose the level of the fair value measurement of its plan assets. The inputs and methodology used in determining the fair value of the plan assets are consistent with those used by AIG to measure its assets as noted in Note 6 herein.
The following table presents information about AIG's plan assets based on the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement falls:
(a)
Includes index funds that primarily track several indices including S&P 500 and S&P 600 in addition to other actively managed accounts, comprised of investments in large cap companies.

(b)
Includes investments in companies in emerging and developed markets.
(c)
Represents investments in U.S. and non-U.S. government issued bonds, U.S. government agency or sponsored agency bonds, and investment grade corporate bonds.
(d)
Consists primarily of investments in securities or debt obligations that have a rating below investment grade.
(e)
Comprised primarily of investments that are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency.
(f)
Includes funds comprised of macro, event driven, long/short equity, and controlled risk hedge fund strategies and a separately managed controlled risk strategy.
(g)
Includes funds that are diverse by geography, investment strategy, and sector.
    The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. Based on AIG's investment strategy, AIG has no significant concentrations of risks.
    The U.S. pension plan holds a group annuity contract with US Life, an AIG subsidiary, which totaled $31 million and $32 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
    The non-U.S. pension plans held an insurance contract with AIG Star, a former AIG subsidiary, which totaled $64 million at December 31, 2010.
Changes in Level 3 fair value measurements

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
Transfers of Level 1 and Level 2 Assets and Liabilities
    AIG's policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 at their fair values as of the end of each reporting period, consistent with the date of the determination of fair value. Assets are transferred out of Level 1 when they are no longer transacted with sufficient frequency and volume in an active market. Conversely, assets are transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 when transaction volume and frequency are indicative of an active market. AIG had no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.
Transfers of Level 3 Assets
    During the year ended December 31, 2011, transfers into Level 3 included certain corporate high yield and mortgage backed securities. The transfers into Level 3 related to investments in certain corporate high yield and mortgage backed securities were due to a decrease in market transparency, downward credit migration and an overall increase in price disparity for certain individual security types.
EXPECTED CASH FLOWS
    Funding for the U.S. pension plan ranges from the minimum amount required by ERISA to the maximum amount that would be deductible for U.S. tax purposes. Contributed amounts in excess of the minimum amounts are deemed voluntary. Amounts in excess of the maximum amount would be subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. There are no minimum required cash contributions for the AIG Retirement Plan in 2012. Supplemental, Excess and postretirement plan payments are deductible when paid.
    AIG's annual pension contribution in 2012 is expected to be approximately $91 million for its non-U.S. and U.S. non-qualified plans. No contributions to the AIG Retirement Plan are currently anticipated. These estimates are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors including AIG's liquidity, market performance and management's discretion.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
    In addition to several small defined contribution plans, AIG sponsors a voluntary savings plan for U.S. employees which provides for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching U.S. contributions by AIG of up to seven percent of annual salary depending on the employees' years of service subject to certain compensation limits. Pre-tax expense associated with this plan was $99 million, $103 million and $100 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Effective January 1, 2012, the plan was amended to change the company matching contribution to 100% of the first six percent of participant contributions and to allow all employees to contribute up to the annual IRS contribution maximum of $17,000.
21. OWNERSHIP
    The Department of the Treasury holds 1,455,037,962 shares of AIG Common Stock, representing ownership of approximately 77 percent of the outstanding AIG Common Stock at December 31, 2011. For discussion of the Recapitalization and the ownership by the Department of the Treasury, see Note 1 herein.
    A Schedule 13G filed February 17, 2012 reports aggregate ownership of 116,573,542 shares, or approximately 6.1 percent (based on the AIG Common Stock outstanding, as adjusted to reflect the warrants owned), of AIG Common Stock and warrants (92,044,583 shares plus 24,528,959 warrants) as of December 31, 2011, including securities beneficially owned by The Fairholme Fund and other funds and investment vehicles managed by Fairholme Capital Management and securities owned by Mr. Bruce Berkowitz personally.
    The calculation of ownership interest for purposes of the AIG Tax Asset Protection Plan and Article 13 of AIG's Restated Certificate of Incorporation is different than beneficial ownership for Schedule 13G. To the best of AIG's knowledge, the Department of the Treasury is the only person deemed for such purposes to have an ownership interest of 4.99 percent or more of AIG Common Stock at December 31, 2011.

    For the year ended December 31, 2011, the effective tax rate on pre-tax loss from continuing operations was not meaningful, due to the significant effect of releasing approximately $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Other less significant factors that contributed to the difference from the statutory rate included tax benefits of $454 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $386 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and $224 million associated with AIG's investment in subsidiaries and partnerships

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, the effective tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations was 34.3 percent. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, attributable to continuing operations differs from the statutory rate primarily due to tax benefits of $1.3 billion associated with AIG's investment in subsidiaries and partnerships, principally the AIA SPV which is treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, and $587 million associated with tax exempt interest, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance attributable to continuing operations of $1.4 billion.
    For the year ended December 31, 2009, the effective tax rate on pre-tax loss from continuing operations was 14.2 percent. The effective tax rate on the pre-tax loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, differs from the statutory rate primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance of $3.0 billion and reserve for uncertain tax positions of $874 million, partially offset by tax exempt interest of $677 million and the change in investment in subsidiaries and partnerships of $473 million which was principally related to changes in the estimated U.S. tax liability with respect to the potential sales of subsidiaries.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ASSESSMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE
    The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires AIG to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.
    AIG's framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets weighs the sustainability of recent operating profitability, the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets, and AIG's emergence from cumulative losses in recent years. The framework requires AIG to consider all available evidence, including:
 - 
the nature, frequency, and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses in recent years;
 - 
the sustainability of recent operating profitability of AIG's subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions;
 - 
the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset;
 - 
the carryforward periods for the net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, including the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences; and,
 - 
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented, if necessary, to protect against the loss of the deferred tax assets.
    During 2011, AIG experienced significant favorable developments, including the completion of the Recapitalization in January 2011, the wind-down of AIGFP's portfolios, the sale of certain businesses, emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and a return to sustainable operating profits within its primary operations. During 2011, AIG's level of profitability, excluding the $3.3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt in January confirmed its return to sustainable operating profit for the full year. This, together with the emergence from cumulative losses in recent years and projections of sufficient future taxable income, represent significant positive evidence. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative positive evidence outweighed the historical negative evidence regarding the likelihood that the deferred tax asset for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group (other than the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards) will be realized. This assessment was evidenced by AIG meeting all of the criteria in its framework, resulting in its conclusion that $18.4 billion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance for AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group should be released in 2011. The life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards may be realized in the future if and when either capital gains are realized or when prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are identified that result in an assessment that the life-insurance-business capital loss carryforwards will be realized on a more-likely-than-not basis prior to their expiration.

DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF U.S. CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX GROUP
    At December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group had net deferred tax assets (liabilities) after valuation allowance of $19.2 billion and $(178) million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group had valuation allowances of $7.2 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively.
    For the year ended December 31, 2011, the decrease in the U.S. consolidated income tax group deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $18.4 billion. The entire decrease in valuation allowance was allocated to continuing operations. The amount allocated to continuing operations also included the decrease in the valuation allowance attributable to the anticipated inclusion of the ALICO SPV within the 2011 U.S. consolidated federal income tax return.
DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY  FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL
    At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, AIG had net deferred tax liabilities of $872 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns.
    At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, AIG had deferred tax asset valuation allowances of $3.8 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, related to foreign subsidiaries, state and local tax jurisdictions, and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns. AIG maintained these valuation allowances following its conclusion that it could not demonstrate that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized. This was primarily due to factors such as cumulative losses in recent years and the inability to demonstrate profits within the specific jurisdictions over the relevant carryforward periods.
TAX EXAMINATIONS AND LITIGATION
    AIG and its eligible U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Several U.S. subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements previously filed separate U.S. federal income tax returns and were not part of the AIG U.S. consolidated income tax group. Subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and foreign law.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    The statute of limitations for all tax years prior to 2000 has expired for AIG's consolidated federal income tax return. AIG is currently under examination for the tax years 2000 through 2006.
    On March 20, 2008, AIG received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS for years 1997 to 1999. The Notice asserted that AIG owes additional taxes and penalties for these years primarily due to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross-border financing transactions. The transactions that are the subject of the Notice extend beyond the period covered by the Notice, and the IRS is challenging the later periods. It is also possible that the IRS will consider other transactions to be similar to these transactions. AIG has paid the assessed tax plus interest and penalties for 1997 to 1999. On February 26, 2009, AIG filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a refund of approximately $306 million in taxes, interest and penalties paid with respect to its 1997 taxable year. AIG alleges that the IRS improperly disallowed foreign tax credits and that AIG's taxable income should be reduced as a result of AIG's 2005 restatement of its consolidated financial statements.
    On March 29, 2011, the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, ruled on a motion for partial summary judgment that AIG filed on July 30, 2010 related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions. The court denied AIG's motion with leave to renew following the completion of discovery regarding certain transactions referred to in AIG's motion, which AIG believes may be significant to the outcome of the action.
    AIG also filed an administrative refund claim on September 9, 2010 for its 1998 and 1999 tax years. AIG will vigorously defend its position, and continues to believe that it has adequate reserves for any liability that could result from the IRS actions.
ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES
The following table presents a rollforward of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:
    At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, AIG's unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions that if recognized would not affect the effective tax rate as they relate to such factors as the timing, rather than the permissibility, of the deduction were $0.7 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Accordingly, at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate were $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.
    The decrease in the gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2011 was primarily related to tax positions that did not affect the effective tax rate because they relate to timing.
    Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, AIG had accrued liabilities of $744 million and $952 million, respectively, for the

payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, AIG accrued expense (benefits) of $(170) million, $152 million and $393 million, respectively, for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties.
    AIG regularly evaluates adjustments proposed by taxing authorities. At December 31, 2011, such proposed adjustments would not have resulted in a material change to AIG's consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to AIG's consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Although it is reasonably possible that a change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, based on the information currently available, AIG does not expect any change to be material to AIG's consolidated financial condition.
Listed below are the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions:

    American International Group, Inc.'s (the Registrant) investments in consolidated subsidiaries are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed income of consolidated subsidiaries. The accompanying condensed financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of American International Group, Inc. and subsidiaries included in this Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    On January 1, 2012, the Registrant retrospectively adopted a standard that changed its subsidiaries' method of accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. The standard clarifies how to determine whether the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred policy acquisition costs. Accordingly, the Registrant revised its financial information and accompanying notes included herein.
The following tables present the Condensed Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the Condensed Statement of Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, showing the amounts previously reported, the effect of the change due to the adoption of the standard and the adjusted amounts that are reflected in the Registrant's condensed financial information:

    In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard that requires the presentation of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components, followed consecutively by a second statement that presents total other comprehensive income and its components. This presentation is effective January 1, 2012 and is required to be applied retrospectively. The Registrant adopted this standard on January 1, 2012 and included the Condensed Consolidating Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
    The Registrant includes in its statement of income (loss) dividends from its subsidiaries and equity in undistributed income (loss) of consolidated subsidiaries, which represents the net income (loss) of each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
    On December 1, 2009, the Registrant and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) completed two transactions that reduced the outstanding balance and the maximum amount of credit available under the FRBNY Credit Facility by $25 billion. In connection with one of those transactions, the Registrant assigned $16 billion of its obligation under the FRBNY Credit Agreement to a subsidiary. The Registrant subsequently settled its obligation to the subsidiary with a $15.5 billion non-cash dividend from the subsidiary. The difference was recognized over the remaining term of the FRBNY Credit Agreement as a reduction to interest expense. The
AIG Form 8-K            239
American International Group, Inc.
remaining difference was derecognized by AIG through earnings due to the repayment in January 2011 of all amounts owed under, and the termination of, the FRBNY Credit Facility.
    Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
    The five-year debt maturity schedule is incorporated by reference from Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements.
    The Registrant files a consolidated federal income tax return with certain subsidiaries and acts as an agent for the consolidated tax group when making payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The Registrant and its subsidiaries have adopted, pursuant to a written agreement, a method of allocating consolidated Federal income taxes. Amounts allocated to the subsidiaries under the written agreement are included in Due to Affiliates in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets.
    Income taxes in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets are comprised of the Registrant's current and deferred tax assets, the consolidated group's current income tax receivable, deferred taxes related to tax attribute carryforwards of AIG's U.S. consolidated income tax group and a valuation allowance to reduce the consolidated deferred tax asset to an amount more likely than not to be realized. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
    The consolidated U.S. deferred tax asset for net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards and valuation allowance are recorded by the Parent Company, which files the consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return, and are not allocated to its subsidiaries. Generally, as, and if, the consolidated net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards are utilized, the intercompany tax balance will be settled with the subsidiaries.

Computation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges
(a)
From continuing operations, excluding undistributed earnings (loss) from equity method investments and capitalized interest. These amounts have been revised to reflect the adoption of the acquisition cost accounting standard on January 1, 2012 . This standard was adopted on a retrospective basis.
(b)
The Ratio of earnings to fixed charges excluding interest credited to policy and contract holders removes interest credited to guaranteed investment contract (GIC) policyholders and guaranteed investment agreement (GIA) contract holders. Such interest expenses are also removed from earnings used in this calculation. GICs and GIAs are entered into by AIG's subsidiaries. The proceeds from GICs and GIAs are invested in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily investment grade bonds. The assets acquired yield rates greater than the rates on the related policyholders obligation or contract, with the intent of earning a profit from the spread.
