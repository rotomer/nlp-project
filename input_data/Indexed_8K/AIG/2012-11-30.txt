AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. ANNOUNCES CONSENT SOLICITATION FOR THE HOLDERS OF ITS 8.125% DEBENTURES DUE 2023, 7.05% NOTES DUE 2025, 7.00% NOTES DUE 2026 AND 5.60% DEBENTURES DUE 2097
NEW YORK, November 30, 2012  American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) ("AIG") today announced that it has commenced a solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from holders of record at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 29, 2012 (the "Record Date") of its 8.125% Debentures Due 2023, 7.05% Notes Due 2025, 7.00% Notes Due 2026 and 5.60% Debentures Due 2097 (the "Securities") to amend (the "Proposed Amendment") the Senior Indenture, dated as of April 15, 1993, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of June 28, 1993, the Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 28, 1996, and the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 1, 1999 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), in each case between AIG (as successor to SunAmerica Inc.) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to the First National Bank of Chicago), as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Proposed Amendment seeks to permit intercompany transfers of Voting Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries (as those terms are defined in the Indenture): (i) to AIG; (ii) to any other Restricted Subsidiary that is, and following such transaction or series of transactions would remain, wholly owned by AIG, directly or indirectly (including through an entity that is not a Restricted Subsidiary), or to one or more entities that are wholly owned by such a Restricted Subsidiary; (iii) to an entity that, as a result of such transaction or series of transactions, would become a Restricted Subsidiary that meets the requirements of clause (ii); or (iv) in a merger of a Restricted Subsidiary with and into another Restricted Subsidiary or AIG. The Proposed Amendment requires the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities outstanding as of the Record Date of all series affected by the Proposed Amendment (voting as one class) (the "Requisite Consents"). The complete terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation will be as set forth in AIG's Consent Solicitation Statement (the "Statement") and the related Letter of Consent, to be distributed to holders of the Securities for their consideration. Holders of the Securities are urged to read the Statement and Letter of Consent carefully.
The Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 12, 2012, unless extended or earlier terminated by AIG in its sole discretion (the "Expiration Time"). The Proposed Amendment will become effective with respect to the Indenture and each series of the Securities upon receipt by AIG of the Requisite Consents that have not been properly revoked and the execution by

If AIG receives the required consent of holders of the Securities, holders who validly deliver their consent in the manner described in the Statement prior to the Expiration Time, and do not validly revoke their consent in the manner described in the Statement, will be eligible to receive a consent fee of $2.50 for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities for which such holder delivered its consent. Upon the effectiveness of the Proposed Amendment, the Indenture will be amended with respect to all holders of the Securities, including non-consenting holders and all subsequent holders of the Securities; however, only holders validly delivering their consent will receive the consent fee.

Each holder of the Securities must make its own decision as to whether to give its consent.
