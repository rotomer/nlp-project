FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
Aimco has prepared this presentation in an effort to provide investors with additional information about Aimco and its 2003 Outlook. Included in this presentation are expected results for 2002 and projected financial information for 2003 as well as the forward-looking business strategies that support Aimco's financial projections. This information is forward-looking under the Federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those presented. In order to develop its 2003 Outlook, Aimco has made assumptions relating to many factors including, but not limited to, occupancy, rent revenue, estimates of ongoing costs and capital expenditures as set forth in the "2003 Outlook" released on December 19, 2002. Although Aimco management believes the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is necessarily subject to uncertainties and involves certain risks, many of which are difficult to predict and are beyond management's control. As such, these statements and information are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this presentation. Actual results could be affected by a variety of factors including: changes in economic conditions, including changes in employment rates and interest rates; government regulations; litigation; competition from other providers of multi-family housing; possible environmental liabilities; insurance losses; failure to meet estimates for property sales; timely completion of development projects; completing the expected transactional activity; and other risks as described in Aimco's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements reflect management's judgment as of this date, and Aimco assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect future events or circumstances.

Strategy and Objectives
 
 - 
                  
Primary objective is to provide a predictable and increasing FCF and NAV through ownership and expertise in affordable properties
                
Negotiate subsidized rent increases to market and/or redevelop approximately 20 to 25 properties per year
                
Redevelopments will be financed primarily with tax exempt debt and tax credit equity
                
Balance of the owned portfolio will be held for its predictable cash flow, or sold to other affordable housing operators at or above NAV
 - 
                  
With more than 100,000 affordable units, plus future acquisitions, this is a long-term growth business for Aimco with high expected returns on Aimco equity
 
Typical Affordable Transactions
 
 - 
                  
There are two primary transactions employed to maximize the value of well located Affordable properties
            
Negotiated Increase in Subsidized Rents to Market Rates
 Subsidy program is maintained, but rents are marked up to market rates.  Often done in connection with a refinancing and cash distribution
            
Tax Credit Redevelopment
 Attractive source of equity capital, often paired with tax exempt debt.  In addition to increased property FCF, presents opportunity to earn developer, placement and asset management fees

Also earn fee income for refinancings and dispositions
