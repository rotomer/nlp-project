DENVER, COLORADOFebruary 11, 2003
SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS
        Apartment Investment and Management Company (NYSE:AIV) ("Aimco") announces fourth quarter and full year 2002 results including
:
 - 
Earnings (Loss) Per Share ("EPS") were $(0.17) and $0.87 on a diluted basis for the three month and full year periods compared with $0.16 and $0.23 for same periods one year ago, respectively.
 - 
Operating Earnings per Share ("OEPS") were $0.21 and $1.49 on a diluted basis for the three month and full year periods compared with $0.18 and $0.52 for the same periods one year ago, respectively.
 - 
Funds From Operations ("FFO") were $118.4 million, or $1.05 per diluted common share for the quarter, and $510.0 million, or $4.64 per diluted common share, for the 2002 year. The comparable results from the same periods in 2001 were $133.6 million, or $1.30 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2001 and $532.3 million, or $5.21 per share, for the year.
MANAGEMENT COMMENTS
        "The weak economy continued to affect negatively the multi-family real estate sector, and Aimco was no exception. Aimco experienced further declines in occupancy and continued to face downward pressure on rent levels in certain markets, particularly in Atlanta, Denver, Charlotte and Phoenix. However, again Aimco can point to its broad geographic and price point diversification in mitigating the effects of the economy. "Same Store" net operating income for the year 2002 was down 1.6% compared with 2001," commented Peter Kompaniez, president of Aimco. "Also, Aimco reported a full quarter of operations from its New England acquisition. In combination with the Casden acquisition made earlier in 2002, total real estate results have benefited from Aimco's sizable expansion into the stronger Southern California and New England markets."
        "Aimco continues to upgrade its portfolio by the sale of lower rated assets. Proceeds from these sales totaled $218 million in the fourth quarter and $522 million for all of 2002," said Terry Considine, Aimco's chairman and chief executive officer. "Aimco expects such sales to total as much as $1.3 billion during 2003 and to generate as much as $300 million in net proceeds that will be applied to repayment of short-term debt and reinvestment in long-term hold properties through Capital Enhancement and redevelopment spending."
COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS
        As previously announced, the Aimco Board of Directors declared the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.82 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, payable on February 18, 2003 to stockholders of record on February 11, 2003. The dividend represents a distribution of 96% of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 78% of FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 and a 9.1% yield based on the $35.90 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on January 30, 2003.
OPERATIONAL RESULTS
Fourth Quarter Property Operations
        Fourth quarter revenue from property operations of $383 million was up $74 million or 24% from fourth quarter 2001 primarily due to the Casden and New England acquisitions, which together contributed $54 million, as well as to newly consolidated properties. The average conventional property monthly rent per unit was $723 compared with $702 in the prior year.
        Fourth quarter expenses from property operations of $157 million were up $29 million or 23% from the fourth quarter 2001 primarily due to the newly acquired properties. Income from Property Operations of $226 million was up $45 million or 25% from fourth quarter 2001, benefiting from new acquisitions and partnership consolidations.
        Fourth quarter results included a full quarter of contribution by the New England properties acquired during the third quarter. During the fourth quarter:
 - 
The Casden properties, located primarily in Southern California and acquired during the first quarter, enjoyed average occupancies above 96%;
 - 
The New England properties were fully integrated into Aimco operations; and
 - 
The Villas at Park La Brea acquired during the quarter improved its lease-up to a current level of 75%.
        When compared to third quarter, the conventional portfolio had lower average occupancy in the "Same Store" portfolio, which was in part seasonal, and higher average rent, which was due to the contribution of the New England properties and fewer lower rent properties due to property sales.
        As announced in the second quarter 2002, Aimco deducts both Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements in calculating Free Cash Flow ("FCF") and AFFO. During the fourth quarter, Capital Replacements were $21.9 million, or $121 per unit and Capital Enhancements were $1.8 million or $10 per unit. The $23.7 million total of these expenditures equals $0.22 per share (based on the AFFO per share calculation).
        Real Estate Free Cash Flow, including Aimco's share of cash flow from unconsolidated properties, was $192 million, up 16% from $166 million in the fourth quarter 2001. In the fourth quarter, FCF from units with rents greater than $1,000 per month increased to $43 million or 22% of real estate FCF versus $27 million or 16% in fourth quarter 2001. This is primarily a result of the Casden and New England acquisitions. Fourth quarter results also reflect higher Capital Replacement spending and the deduction of Capital Enhancement costs.
"Same Store" Results
        "Same Store" results reflect the performance of conventional communities owned and stabilized within Aimco's portfolio during both the current and prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by interim transactions. "Same Store" properties accounted for 81% of fourth quarter real estate FCF. There are 620 "Same Store" communities with a total 173,397 apartment units in which Aimco has a weighted average 79.4% ownership.
           
        "Same Store" revenues in the fourth quarter were $277 million, down $10 million or 3.5% from the prior year due:
 - 
$6 million to lower average rents, down $11 per unit or 1.6%;
 - 
$5 million to lower occupancy, down 230 basis points;
 - 
$2 million to increased bad debt; somewhat offset by
 - 
$3 million of ancillary income.
           
        "Same Store" expenses in the fourth quarter 2002 were $103 million, down $2 million or 1.7% from the prior year due primarily to:
 - 
Lower resident turnover;
 - 
Lower insurance cost; somewhat offset by
 - 
Higher property taxes.
        "Same Store" NOI in the fourth quarter 2002 was $174 million, down $8 million or 4.6% from the prior year.
        For full year 2002, "Same Store" revenues were $1.130 billion, down $8 million or 0.7% from the prior year due:
 - 
$7 million to lower average rents, down $4 per unit or 0.5%;
 - 
$11 million to lower occupancy, down 80 bp;
 - 
$13 million to increased bad debt; somewhat offset by
 - 
$23 million of higher utility reimbursement income and other ancillary income.
          
        For full year 2002, "Same Store" expenses were $421 million, up $4 million or 0.9% from the prior year due primarily to:
 - 
$7 million of higher taxes and insurance; somewhat offset by
 - 
$3 million lower controlled costs.
        For full year 2002, "Same Store" NOI was $710 million, down $12 million or 1.6% from the prior year.
        It is noteworthy that, had the Casden and New England acquisitions been owned long enough to have been included in the "Same Store" portfolio, the change in NOI would have been down 3.6% for the fourth quarter as compared to fourth quarter 2001, and would have been down 1.2% for 2002 as compared to the prior year.
        During the fourth quarter and despite the generally weak economy, Aimco confronted a wide range of market conditions. To emphasize the breadth of this range, Aimco has again classified the 40 largest markets where Aimco earns 82% of its "Same Store" NOI as "Good", "Bad" or "Ugly".
(1)
See Supplemental Schedule IX, X and XI for detailed market by market data
        By comparison to third quarter 2002, fourth quarter revenue was down by 1.5%, which was in part seasonal, while expenses were lower by 6.1%. This resulted in an increase in NOI of 1.5%. In certain markets, competitive pressure from higher concessions and lower rents was greater than expected, and the decline in Aimco occupancy was also more than expected. Some of this decline may also be due to Aimco maintaining, and even increasing, credit standards required of new residents. In these markets, Aimco is working to increase occupancies through better marketing practices and, in some cases, by
reducing rents. The reduction in expenses from the third to the fourth quarter is due to seasonal reduction in spending for repairs and landscaping and also to lower costs for resident turnover, which were somewhat offset by higher property taxes.
Investment Management Activity
        Investment Management contributed $7.5 million or 3.7% of FCF. Investment Management earned $6.5 million by providing property management, asset management, construction management, refinancing, disposition, development and other services to affiliated partnerships, all as provided by the respective partnership agreements. During fourth quarter 2002, Aimco provided such services to 728 consolidated partnerships and 464 unconsolidated partnerships. Aimco owns an average of 89% of the consolidated partnerships and 21% of the unconsolidated partnerships. Fees relating to Aimco's ownership have been eliminated. The gross value of the limited partner share of the unconsolidated partnerships is estimated at $4 billion of which approximately 65% is funded with non-recourse debt. Investment Management included fees of $3.6 million primarily due to increased activities of Aimco Capital.
        Investment Management also earned $1 million by providing similar services to unrelated third parties owning 104 properties, including approximately 11,535 units. For 7,955 of these units, services are provided pursuant to long-term contracts.
Interest Income and General Partner Loans
        Interest and other income was $20 million, a decrease of $2 million or 9% from $22 million in fourth quarter 2001. Of this total, General Partner loan interest income of $2 million decreased by $1 million from $3 million in fourth quarter 2001, due to collection of Notes Receivable.
        Aimco held $169 million in carrying value ($331 million in face value) of loans receivable from affiliated partnerships at December 31, 2002 compared with $244 million at December 31, 2001, a reduction of $75 million or 31%. During fourth quarter, Aimco completed its year-long review of the collectibility of each of these loans. For the fourth quarter, this review identified transactional income (accretion) of $17 million and impairments of $4 million, a net of $13 million. Impairments were treated as a period expense and accounted for as "Provision for losses on notes receivable". For all of 2002, this process identified accretion of $44 million and impairments of $9 million, a net of $35 million. These results compare to accretion of $16 million in fourth quarter 2001 and $36 million for all of 2001.
G&A and other expenses
        General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the quarter were $8 million, up $2.3 million compared with the year ago period due to increased professional fees related primarily to the evaluation of the General Partner loan portfolio.
        Other expenses of $5.2 million for the quarter included abandoned pursuit costs of $1.2 million and personnel costs of $4.0 million primarily related to year-end compensation.
Gain (loss) on Dispositions and Income (loss) from Discontinued Operations
        Aimco recognized a loss on dispositions, not otherwise included in discontinued operations, of $28 million in fourth quarter 2002 and $28 million for the entire year. This loss is due primarily to a $38 million change in estimate due to better insight into data related to the finalization of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities of past acquisitions, including limited partnership activities, partially offset by property sale gains of $10 million in 2002.
        Aimco recognized a loss from discontinued operations equal to $0.2 million for fourth quarter from consolidated assets sold or held for sale and $6 million for the entire year, primarily relating to the sale of senior living properties in second quarter of 2002.
        Detailed information is provided in footnotes [g] and [h] to Supplemental Schedule I.
Summary of Fourth Quarter and Full Year Performance
        FFO per share in fourth quarter of $1.05 met "guidance" of between $1.04 and $1.10 while AFFO per share of $0.83 was three cents below the expected range of $0.86 to $0.92, due to higher Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending. As expected, operations contributed $1.01, or 96%, of FFO per share. The two-cent incremental contribution over the third quarter is due to sequentially better "Same Store" NOI and a full quarter of results from the New England acquisition.
        Transactions contributed $0.04 per share to fourth quarter 2002 FFO per share and included Activity based fees of $0.03 plus accretion net of impairments of $0.12 offset by $0.05 of other expenses, and net non-recurring expenses of $0.06, primarily professional fees associated with the loan review process (G&A) and write-off of deferred financing costs (Interest Expense).
        For the year, real estate operations contributed $4.23 or 91% of total FFO per share of $4.64.
TRANSACTION AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY
Acquisitions
        On December 3, 2002, the Company announced the closing of its purchase of The Villas at Park La Brea, a mid-rise apartment community located in Los Angeles in the mid-Wilshire area. This newly constructed community has 250 apartments and was purchased for $55.5 million.
        Also during the quarter, Aimco purchased interests in 27 partnerships owning 27 properties for an aggregate of $7 million.
Dispositions
        Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet long-term investment criteria, and seeks to sell these properties.
        During 2002, Aimco sold 87 properties for $552 million in gross proceeds, generating net proceeds to Aimco of $137 million after payment of mortgage debt and limited partner interests. During the fourth quarter, Aimco sold 35 apartment communities, of which 24 were conventional and 11 were affordable.
        The yields shown below are calculated as the Free Cash Flow earned by the properties during the 12 months prior to their sale, divided by their sales price. Free Cash Flow is defined as Net Operating Income less $478 per unit Capital Replacements (Aimco actual 2002 CR per unit) and is before debt service. The prices received for these properties slightly exceeded Aimco's reported estimate of their net asset value.
(1)
Net of partner interests and mortgage debt.
        Aimco currently has 137 conventional properties (approximately 34,000 units with average rents of $500 per unit) and 115 affordable properties (approximately 12,000 units with average rents of approximately $500 per unit) being marketed for sale and anticipates gross sales proceeds of approximately $1.0 to $1.3 billion during 2003. Aimco expects that its share of cash from these dispositions, net of partner interests and after mortgage debt, will be up to $300 million.
Redevelopment Activity
        As of year-end, Aimco had 10 properties with 3,678 units under redevelopment having an estimated total investment (fair market value prior to redevelopment plus new redevelopment spending) of $601 million, of which approximately $34 million remains to be spent. Aimco's share of the estimated total investment is $501 million, of which approximately $21 million remains to be spent.
BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY
Financing Activity
        For 2002, approximately $270 million of convertible preferred securities were converted into Aimco Class A Common Stock.
        During the fourth quarter, Aimco closed 30 mortgage loans generating $346 million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.29%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners totaling $202 million, Aimco's share of the net proceeds was $119 million.
        At year-end, Aimco had total mortgage debt of $6.3 billion, of which $5.9 billion, or 94%, was consolidated debt (Aimco share of consolidated debt was $5.3 billion) and $0.4 billion, or 6%, was Aimco's pro rata share of unconsolidated debt. Total mortgage debt had a weighted average maturity of 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of 6.5%. Further, 84% ($5.3 billion) of the mortgage debt is fixed rate and 16% ($1.0 billion) is variable rate, of which 80% ($797 million) is tax-exempt financing. In addition, Aimco had $406 million in short-term debt, including $115 million on the Casden term loan and $291 million borrowed on its line of credit.
Note: Debt includes Aimco's proportionate share of total debt. Common equity calculations use quarter-end trading prices of Aimco common stock.
        In the fourth quarter, consolidated debt increased slightly as increased consolidations and refinancings more than offset scheduled amortization payments, reductions in debt attributable to property sales and the reduction of short-term borrowings. Because of the decline in the share price, debt increased to 55% of total capitalization and debt plus preferred stock increased to 65%.
        Free Cash Flow coverage of interest expense and preferred dividends was:
Liquidity
        Aimco had $291 million outstanding on its $400 million revolving line of credit at quarter end with availability of $109 million. During the fourth quarter, borrowings on the line of credit included a $37 million draw related to tenders and acquisitions with the remainder used to fund redevelopment and general corporate activity.
        Aimco generated cash from internal sources equal to $136 million for the quarter and $244 million for the year. During the year, Aimco applied $49 million of sales proceeds to paydown the Casden term loan.

(a)
In second quarter of 2002, Aimco determined to deduct Capital Enhancements, as well as Capital Replacements, to calculate Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Funds From Operations on a prospective basis.
Supplemental Schedule IV
Supplemental Schedule IV (continued)
Supplemental Schedule V
        Free Cash Flow, Earnings Before Structural Depreciation, Funds From Operations, and Adjusted Funds From Operations are measurement standards used by the Company's management. These should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indication of the Company's performance or as a measure of liquidity.
 - 
"Free Cash Flow" ("FCF") is defined by the Company as net operating income minus the Capital Replacement spending invested to maintain and the Capital Enhancement spending invested to improve the related assets. It measures profitability prior to the cost of capital.
 - 
"Earnings Before Structural Depreciation" ("EBSD") is defined by the Company as net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, plus "Structural Depreciation," (i.e. depreciation of buildings and land improvements whose useful lives exceed 20 years.)
 - 
"Funds From Operations" ("FFO") is defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and disposals from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. Aimco calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership, plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities whose conversion is dilutive to FFO. There can be no assurance that Aimco's basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
 - 
"Adjusted Funds From Operations" ("AFFO") is defined by Aimco as FFO less actual spending for Capital Replacements and Capital Enhancements equal to $131 per apartment unit for the three months ended December 31, 2002, based on weighted average equivalent units of approximately 180,000 for the quarter.
