EXHIBIT 99.1 AIMCO 1st Quarter 2003 Denver, Colorado - May 6, 2003 Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces First Quarter 2003 Results Economy, Weather and Pricing Strategy Impact Results Focus on Occupancy Results in Steady Monthly Increases SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Apartment Investment and Management Company (NYSE:AIV) ("Aimco") announced first quarter 2003 results including: - Net Income was $21.8 million compared with $70.1 million in the first quarter 2002. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.00 on a diluted basis compared with $0.58 in the same period last year, based on Net Income attributable to common stockholders. - Funds from Operations (FFO; a non-GAAP measure defined in the Glossary in Supplemental Information (the "Glossary")) were $101.5 million, or $0.90 per diluted common share compared with $135.2 million, or $1.30 per share in the first quarter 2002. - Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO; a non-GAAP measure defined in the Glossary) were $68.5 million or $0.64 per diluted common share compared with $117.1 million, or $1.12 per share in the first quarter 2002.

Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 2 Management Comments "On a positive note, the Aimco team was delighted that the company was included in the S&P 500. The selection of Aimco is testament to its successful past, expresses confidence in its future and recognizes that Aimco shares provide an effective way for investors to participate in America's multi-family sector," said Terry Considine, Aimco's chairman and chief executive officer. "We welcome the many new investors." "On a different note," added Mr. Considine, "first quarter results did not meet earlier expectations. As we announced in March, first quarter results were burdened by continued weakness in the economy as well as by costs related to severe cold and snow. While there is no doubt that business conditions for apartments were quite poor during the quarter, it also seems to me that Aimco did not address these conditions with satisfactory focus and effectiveness. Looking back, I can see that we were slow to respond to the increased use of upfront rent concessions and that we were distracted by the work of implementing a new site operating software. While these are explanations, they are not excuses and I accept responsibility for the disappointing results." "Together with my colleagues, I am committed to restore Aimco's historic profitability. The Aimco specific shortfall to market occupancies peaked in January and has been largely eliminated. The industry experience of lower effective rents and increased expenses continues." Dividends on Common Stock The Aimco Board of Directors declared the quarterly cash dividend of $0.82 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, payable on May 22, 2003 to stock-holders of record on May 15, 2003. The dividend represents 126% of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 91% of FFO for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and an 8.4% yield based on the $39.21 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on May 5, 2003. The Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend each quarter. If the payout ratio were, or were expected, to exceed 100% for a sustained period, the Board of Directors will consider a change in the dividend to match operating profitability. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 3 Operational Results PROPERTY OPERATIONS First quarter revenue from property operations of $378.8 million was up $64.3 million or 20% compared with the first quarter 2002 primarily due to increased revenue from acquisitions and newly consolidated properties totaling $81.8 million, somewhat offset by a $17.1 million reduction in consolidated "Same Store" revenue (See Supplemental Schedule VIII). The average conventional property monthly rent per unit was $720 compared with $731 in the same period last year. First quarter expenses from property operations of $168.0 million were up $51.9 million or 45% compared with the first quarter 2002 primarily due to expenses associated with acquisitions and newly consolidated properties totaling $36.5 million. In addition, consolidated "Same Store" expenses were up $13.2 million including higher expenses related to unusually severe weather, turnover, marketing and other as described under "Same Store" Property Results. Total income from property operations was $210.8 million, up $12.4 million or 6.3% compared with the first quarter 2002. This included net operating income of $33.9 million from acquisitions made during 2002, including: - Properties acquired in the Casden merger, which have performed in-line with pro forma expectations and enjoyed a 90 basis point increase in occupancy during the quarter; - New England area properties, whose operating results were adversely affected by increased vacancy due to job losses in the local economy and increased expenses due to snow and cold weather. Occupancy averaged 91.1% for the quarter and had recovered to 94.8% at the end of April; - The Villas at Park La Brea, the first phase of a three-phase project currently in lease-up, enjoyed an increase in leased units from approximately 70% at the beginning of the quarter to approximately 80% at quarter-end. Aimco expects this property to reach stabilization in the third quarter, ahead of projections. For the first quarter, occupancy averaged 89.6% on the conventional portfolio compared with 91.3% in the first quarter 2002, turnover of 12% compared with 14% in the first quarter 2002, and average concessions of $17 per unit compared with $10 in the first quarter 2002. Concessions are considered in the calculation of average monthly rent. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 4 Capital Replacements were $26.1 million and Capital Enhancements were $0.7 million in the quarter, which totals are deducted in calculating AFFO. This compares with $18.2 million in Capital Replacements in the first quarter 2002. Aimco did not deduct Capital Enhancements in calculating AFFO prior to the second quarter 2002. Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending is expected to total between $500 and $525 per unit for the full year 2003, although first quarter spending was ratably higher. "SAME STORE" PROPERTY RESULTS "Same Store" results reflect the performance of conventional communities whose ownership exceeds 10% and are stabilized within Aimco's portfolio during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions. "Same Store" consolidated properties accounted for 75% of Income from Property Operations in the first quarter 2003. "Same Store" consolidated properties include 537 properties and 153,415 units. Historically, Aimco's "Same Store" results have measured Aimco's effective ownership in "Same Store" communities and have included Aimco's ownership interest in unconsolidated "Same Store" properties as well as subtracted the minority interest share of consolidated [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 5 properties (see reconciliation on Supplemental Schedule VIII). In keeping with this definition, the "Same Store" portfolio accounted for 76% of Real Estate Free Cash Flow (Free Cash Flow, "FCF", is a non-GAAP measure defined in the Glossary and presented and reconciled to GAAP income on Supplemental Schedule II). "Same Store" Free Cash Flow is generated from 618 "Same Store" communities with a total of 170,693 apartment units in which Aimco has a weighted average 81.6% ownership (see Supplemental Schedule IX). Revenue from the "Same Store" portfolio was $273.9 million compared with $291.2 million in the first quarter 2002. The decrease in revenue of $17.3 million or 6.0% is due primarily to (i) a decline in occupancy by 230 basis points to 90.3%, and (ii) a 2.7% decrease in the average "Same Store" rent from $701 to $682 per apartment. "Same Store" expenses of $113.8 million increased by $12.5 million or 12.3% compared with the first quarter 2002. Increased expenses were primarily due to: (i) weather related increases estimated at $4.3 million, due to increased utility expenses and snow removal; (ii) expenses related to making apartments ready for spring leasing of approximately $2.9 million, including turnover and marketing; (iii) reduced payroll capitalized in connection with capitalized costs of $2.1 million; (iv) increased property taxes of $1.0 million; and, (v) increased other expenses of $2.2 million, including contract services, repairs and maintenance and administration. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income was $160.0 million for the quarter, down 15.7% from the first quarter 2002. Comparing "Same Store" results on a sequential basis, Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio experienced a decline in occupancy from 91.1% in the fourth quarter 2002 to 90.3% in the first quarter 2003. "Same Store" average rent declined from $691 in the fourth quarter 2002 to $682 in the first quarter 2003. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income declined $14.5 million, or 8.3% on a sequential basis. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 6 During the first quarter, Aimco operations worked to reverse this decline in Same Store revenue, notwithstanding the highly competitive conditions in certain markets. Occupancy increased each month during the quarter, ending March at approximately 91.0%. As of the end of April, average Same Store occupancy was 92.3% and average rent was $682. Investment Management Activity Income from Investment Management was $4.7 million, up from $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2002. Income earned from property management and fees associated with asset management, construction management, refinancing, dispositions, development and other services to affiliated partnerships was $7.7 million in the quarter compared with $5.9 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher fees earned from Aimco Capital activities. Income earned from property management and fees in the first quarter 2003 was somewhat offset by insurance expenses of $2.5 million and a $0.9 million charge for the relocation of corporate headquarters. In addition, Management expenses were reduced by $8.0 million by the reversal of a valuation reserve on deferred tax assets resulting in a tax benefit. Income from Investment Management also includes $0.3 million from providing property management to unrelated third parties owning 98 properties with 11,180 units and expenses of $0.8 million from amortization of management contracts. INTEREST INCOME AND GENERAL PARTNER LOANS Interest and Other Income was $6.5 million, a decrease of $12.2 million from the first quarter of 2002, primarily due to lower accretion recorded in 2003. Total Interest and Other Income included interest income from General Partner loans of $4.8 million, a decrease of $3.3 million compared with the first quarter 2002 due to collection of notes receivable. Notes receivable from affiliated partnerships were $158.3 million ($241.8 million face value) at quarter-end versus $249.1 million at March 31, 2002, a reduction of $90.8 million or 36%. Aimco recognized transactional income (accretion) of $1.1 million, and impairments of $0.7 million, in the quarter compared with $10.1 million in accretion and no impairments in the first quarter 2002. G&A General and Administrative expenses for the quarter were $5.4 million, up from $3.1 million in the first quarter 2002. The $2.3 million increase is primarily due to: (i) $0.5 million for increased compensation related to additional employees in corporate legal, dispositions and accounting; (ii) $0.3 million in increased compensation due to promotions; (iii) $0.2 [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 7 million for increased accounting and legal fees related to compliance; and (iv) $0.8 million in higher amortization of stock compensation, including $0.2 million for expensing stock options. GAIN (LOSS) ON DISPOSITIONS AND INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Aimco recognized a gain on dispositions of $0.3 million compared with a loss of $4.0 million in the first quarter 2002. In addition, Loss From Discontinued Operations includes an impairment charge of $5.3 million relating to the carrying value of certain properties held for sale. SUMMARY OF FIRST QUARTER PERFORMANCE EPS of $0.00 was less than the projected range of $0.06 to $0.12 due primarily to the shortfall in income from property operations. FFO per share of $0.90 was in line with estimates as revised on March 14, 2003. Comparing FFO on a sequential basis, per share FFO declined $0.15 from the $1.05 earned in the fourth quarter 2002 due to: Transaction and Redevelopment Activity ACQUISITIONS During the first quarter, Aimco purchased interests in 25 partnerships owning 31 properties for an aggregate of $6.4 million. Aimco also purchased for $5 million a 34 unit conventional property located on East 73rd Street in Manhattan. DISPOSITIONS Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet long-term investment criteria and seeks to sell these properties. During the first quarter, Aimco sold 18 properties including 3,909 apartment units for $128 million in gross proceeds, generating net cash proceeds to Aimco of $38 million after [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 8 payment of mortgage debt and limited partner interests. Of the properties sold, eleven were conventional, six were affordable and one was commercial. See the chart below for additional information on disposition activity. The FCF Yield is calculated as the FCF earned by the properties during the 12 months prior to their sale divided by the sales price. FCF includes a $525 per unit deduction for Capital Replacements and is before debt service. Aimco currently has 125 conventional properties (approximately 32,000 units with average rents of $510 per unit) and 140 affordable properties (approximately 13,000 units with average rents of approximately $485 per unit) being marketed for sale and anticipates gross sales proceeds of approximately $800 to $900 million through the remainder of 2003. Aimco expects that its share of cash from these dispositions, net of partner interests and after mortgage debt, will be approximately $210 to $250 million. REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY At quarter-end, Aimco had seven conventional redevelopment properties with 3,327 units and two affordable properties with 467 units undergoing redevelopment. Redevelopment expenditures in the quarter were $24.2 million of which Aimco's share was $19.0 million. Redevelopment expenditures for the seven conventional projects is expected to total $374 million, including unconsolidated interests, of which approximately $43 million remains to be spent. Aimco's share of total redevelopment spending is $289 million, of which approximately $28 million remains to be spent. Aimco's largest redevelopment, Flamingo Resort Residences with 1,688 apartments located in Miami Beach, Florida, has 815 completed units and 873 units under redevelopment. Final completion, including all units, commercial areas and the north pool and fitness center, is expected by year-end. Of the 815 completed units 786, or 96%, were occupied in March with rent levels well ahead of projections. Calhoun Beach Club, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota in which Aimco invested $32 million in redevelopment spending, was completed [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 9 last fall and is expected to reach stabilization in the third quarter with occupancy at 89% at the end of April. Balance Sheet and Liquidity FINANCING ACTIVITY During the first quarter, Aimco closed seven conventional property mortgage loans generating $49.9 million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.93%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners totaling $20.4 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $13.3 million. At quarter-end, Aimco's consolidated mortgage debt was $5,809 million. In addition, Aimco had $471 million in short-term debt, including $104 million on the Casden term loan and $367 million borrowed on its line of credit. Aimco's pro rata share of mortgage debt (including total consolidated debt and its share of unconsolidated debt) was $6,271 million at quarter-end (see Supplemental Schedule V for detail). This total had a weighted average maturity of 14 years and weighted average interest rate of 6.58%. Further, 84% was fixed rate debt and 16% was variable rate debt. Seventy-eight percent of variable rate debt is tax exempt. (1) Aimco share of debt excluding the minority interest in consolidated debt, see Supplemental Schedule V (2) 105.813 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2003 times the closing price of $36.48 per share [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 10 Subsequent to quarter-end and announced on May 1, Aimco sold $100 million of newly issued Class S Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an institutional investor. The initial dividend rate will be based on three month LIBOR plus 275 basis points.

Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 5 GLOSSARY GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASUREMENTS Financial and operational measurements found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain non-GAAP financial measurements standardly used by Aimco management. Measurements include FFO, which is an industry-accepted measurement as based on the definition of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). These terms are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled to the most comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measurements on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): is a commonly used term defined by NAREIT as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, dispositions of depreciable real estate property, disposals of discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. Aimco calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for the minority interest in the Aimco's operating partnership (Aimco Properties, L.P.), plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities the conversion of which is dilutive to FFO. This supplemental measure captures real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Please see Schedules I and II for FFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): is FFO less both Capital Replacement expenditures and Capital Enhancement expenditures. Similar to FFO, AFFO captures real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property, and AFFO also reflects that Capital Replacements are necessary to maintain the associated real estate assets. Please see Schedules I and II for AFFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company First Quarter 2003 - Page 6 FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): Because Aimco has substantial unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows as related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings. FCF, as defined by Aimco includes net operating income from real estate minus Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the Investment Management Business, General and Administrative expenses and other expenses incurred by the company. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. Please see Schedule II for FCF data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. UNCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS: such as Aimco's share of unconsolidated cash, unconsolidated restricted cash, unconsolidated accounts receivable and unconsolidated debt are components of Balance Sheet line items on the GAAP Financial Statements that are useful in understanding Aimco's proportionate share of assets and liabilities, prior to consolidation in GAAP financial statements. SAME STORE SALES: represents an operating measure that is used commonly to describe properties that have been in the portfolio for a period of time and therefore serve as a good basis upon which to review comparative performance data. Aimco's definition of Same Store communities are conventional communities that are owned and have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. Please see Schedules VIII through XI for Same Store data reconciled to Net Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. CAPITAL REPLACEMENT AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS (CR & CE): are operating measures and components of total capital expenditures. CR spending can be equated with maintenance capital in other industries and is spending invested to maintain Aimco's assets. CE spending is spending to improve Aimco's assets. CR and CE spending are components of capital expenditures denoted as line items in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows. [AIMCO LOGO]
