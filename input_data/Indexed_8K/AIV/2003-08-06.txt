EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 AIMCO 2ND QUARTER 2003 Denver, Colorado - August 6, 2003 APARTMENT INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT COMPANY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2003 RESULTS Occupancy Gains Drive $3.3 Million Increase in Quarterly "Same Store" Net Rental Income. Transactions Reduce Cost of Preferred Capital. SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Apartment Investment and Management Company (NYSE:AIV) ("Aimco") announced second quarter 2003 results including: - Net Income was $59.2 million, compared with $46.0 million in the second quarter 2002. Earnings per share (EPS) was $0.39 on a diluted basis, compared with $0.26 in the same period last year, based on Net Income attributable to common stockholders. - Funds from Operations (FFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary in Supplemental Information (the "Glossary")) was $100.6 million, or $0.91 per diluted common share, compared with $133.1 million, or $1.20 per share in the second quarter 2002. - Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary) was $76.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted common share, compared with $99.2 million, or $0.97 per share, in the second quarter 2002.

Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 2 MANAGEMENT COMMENTS "The economy is 18 months into recovery. Leading indicators are up for the third straight month. Tax, fiscal and monetary stimulus is substantial. BUT: it remains very tough in the apartment business to raise rents and increase occupancy," said Terry Considine, Aimco's chairman and chief executive officer. "At the same time, operating expenses have increased at rates above inflation." "In this environment, Aimco is focused on improving cost controls and lowering its cost of capital by refinancing property debt and refunding preferred stocks." DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK As previously announced, the Aimco Board of Directors declared the quarterly cash dividend of $0.82 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, payable on August 21, 2003 to stockholders of record on August 14, 2003. The dividend represents 114% of AFFO (before deducting Capital Enhancements) and 90% of FFO for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 and an 8.3% yield based on the $39.55 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on August 5, 2003. The Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend each quarter. If the payout ratio were, or were expected, to exceed 100% for a sustained period, the Board of Directors will consider a change in the dividend to match operating profitability. OPERATIONAL RESULTS PROPERTY OPERATIONS Second quarter revenue from property operations (which includes all real estate as reported on the GAAP Income Statements: consolidated conventional and affordable, as segmented on Schedules VIII, X and XII of Supplemental Information) of $378.4 million was up $44.0 million, or 13%, compared with the second quarter 2002 primarily due to revenue from acquisition properties, newly consolidated properties and redevelopment properties totaling $56.0 million, somewhat offset by the effects of a weaker economy including a $10.1 million reduction in consolidated "Same Store" revenue. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 3 Second quarter expenses from property operations of $165.4 million were up $30.9 million, or 23%, compared with the second quarter 2002 primarily due to expenses from acquisition properties, newly consolidated properties and redevelopment properties totaling $24.2 million. In addition, consolidated "Same Store" expenses were up $8.3 million, including higher expenses related to utilities, turnover and landscaping as described under "Same Store" Property Results. PROPERTY OPERATIONS Total income from property operations was $213.0 million, up $13.1 million, or 7%, compared with the second quarter 2002. This included Net Operating Income of $10.7 million from acquisitions made in the second half of 2002: - The New England area properties enjoyed a 4.1% increase in Net Rental Income during the quarter and a 438 basis point increase in occupancy to 95.5%; and - The Villas at Park La Brea, located in Los Angeles, ended the quarter at 95% occupancy, up from 80% at the beginning of the quarter, reaching stabilization earlier than projected. "SAME STORE" PROPERTY RESULTS The "Same Store" portfolio includes 608 communities with a total of 169,355 apartment units in which Aimco has a weighted average ownership of 82.5% (see Supplemental Schedule IX). Revenue from the "Same Store" portfolio was $288.2 million compared with $299.4 million in the second quarter 2002. The decrease in revenue of $11.2 million, or 3.7%, is due primarily to (i) a decline in occupancy by 90 basis points to 92.6%, and (ii) a 2% decrease in the average "Same Store" rent from $716 to $699 per apartment as a result of competitive leasing environments in certain markets, particularly Atlanta, Phoenix, Denver, Houston and Austin. "Same Store" expenses of $116.3 million increased by $7.9 million, or 7.3%, compared with the second quarter 2002. Increased expenses were primarily due to: (i) $2.1 million in higher utility expenses; (ii) $2.4 million in higher expenses related to increasing occupancy, including turnover, marketing and administration; (iii) $2.5 million in higher repairs and maintenance and [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 4 landscaping services, in support of efforts to improve the physical appearance and condition of properties; and (iv) $0.8 million in increased insurance expenses. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income was $171.9 million for the quarter, down 10% from the second quarter 2002. SAME STORE OPERATING RESULTS Comparing "Same Store" results on a sequential basis, Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio realized a $3.3 million increase in Net Rental Income (as defined in the Glossary) in the second quarter compared with the first quarter driven by a 200 basis point increase in average occupancy from 90.6% to 92.6%, somewhat offset by a 1% decline in average rent from $706 to $699. "Same Store" portfolio Net Operating Income increased $2.7 million, or 1.6%, on a sequential basis. For the second quarter, other "Same Store" operating measures included turnover of 15%, compared with 16% in the second quarter 2002, and average concessions of $22 per unit, compared with $12 in the second quarter 2002. Concessions are considered in calculating average monthly rent. "Same Store" results reflect the performance of conventional communities in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions. The 16 conventional properties acquired in March 2002 are included in the "Same Store" portfolio for the second quarter 2003. Aimco's "Same Store" results measure Aimco's effective ownership in "Same Store" communities and include Aimco's ownership interest in unconsolidated "Same Store" properties and subtract the minority interest share of consolidated properties (see reconciliation on Supplemental Schedule VIII). In keeping with this definition, the "Same Store" portfolio accounted for 85% of Real Estate Free Cash Flow (Free Cash Flow, "FCF", [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 5 is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary and presented and reconciled to GAAP income on Supplemental Schedule II). CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS Capital Replacements (as defined in the Glossary) were $20.9 million and Capital Enhancements (as defined in the Glossary) were $1.5 million in the quarter, which totals are deducted in calculating AFFO. This compares with $18.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively in the second quarter 2002. Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending together are expected to total between $525 and $550 per unit for the full year 2003. Beginning in the second quarter 2003, capital expenditures made on properties sold, held for sale or identified to be sold within one year are classified as Disposition Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Glossary). Disposition Capital Expenditures totaled $5.4 million in the quarter. CAPITAL REPLACEMENT & CAPITAL ENHANCEMENT EXPENDITURES [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 6 INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY Income from Investment Management was $3.0 million, down from $7.3 million in the second quarter of 2002. Income earned from property management and fees associated with asset management, construction management, refinancing, dispositions, development and other services to affiliated partnerships was $5.4 million in the quarter compared with $10.9 million in the prior year period. As Aimco increases its ownership of partnership properties, the portion of property management fees eliminated by GAAP as "self charged" also increases and realized management fees decline. Fees earned primarily from Aimco Capital activities declined from $4.0 million in the second quarter 2002 to $1.9 million in the second quarter 2003, primarily due to deferred asset management fees that were higher in 2002 than 2003. In the second quarter 2002, income earned from property management and fees was somewhat offset by insurance claims losses of $3.5 million. There were no such losses in the second quarter 2003. Income from Investment Management also includes $0.2 million from providing property management to third parties owning 104 properties with 11,951 units. ADDITIONAL INCOME INFORMATION INTEREST INCOME AND GENERAL PARTNER LOANS Interest and Other Income was $5.9 million, a decrease of $16.7 million from the second quarter of 2002, primarily due to lower transactional income in 2003. Total Interest and Other Income included interest income from General Partner loans of $3.2 million, a decrease of $5.6 million compared with the second quarter 2002 due to collection of notes receivable. Notes receivable primarily from affiliated partnerships were $174.9 million ($254.3 million face value) at quarter-end versus $290.6 million ($434.0 million face value) at June 30, 2002, a reduction of $115.7 million, or 40%, primarily due to collections of the notes receivable and GAAP required eliminations on newly consolidated partnerships. Aimco recognized in the quarter total transactional income of $1.5 million and impairments of $0.8 million, compared with $13.2 million in transactional income and $3.2 million of impairments in the second quarter 2002. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 7 INTEREST EXPENSE Consolidated interest expense was $92.8 million for the quarter, an increase of $11.8 million compared with $81.0 million in the second quarter 2002. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of an increase in debt associated with newly consolidated and acquisition properties. G&A General and Administrative expenses for the quarter were $6.5 million, up from $4.9 million in the second quarter 2002. The $1.6 million increase is primarily due to: (i) $0.5 million for increased compensation related to additional employees; and (ii) $1.0 million for increased costs associated with regulatory compliance (primarily the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002). GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS AND INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate of $1.0 million and Income from Discontinued Operations of $37.0 million in second quarter 2003 compared with $12.5 million and a loss of $16.6 million, respectively, in the second quarter 2002. Income from Discontinued Operations in the second quarter 2003 included a net gain on sales of $38.3 million, somewhat offset by income taxes on dispositions. SUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER PERFORMANCE EPS of $0.39 was significantly higher than the projected range of ($0.01) to $0.02 due primarily to the Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate of $38.3 million, which is recorded in Discontinued Operations. FFO per share of $0.91 was in line with the estimates provided May 6, 2003. Comparing FFO on a sequential basis, per share FFO increased $0.01 from the $0.90 earned in the first quarter due to:
First quarter 2003 FFO per share $ 0.900 First quarter 2003 non-recurring tax benefit (0.080) Income from property operations 0.080 Investment Management, net 0.050 Deferred financing costs (0.015) Interest expense, due to lower capitalized interest (0.015) G&A (0.010) ---------- Second quarter 2003 FFO per share $ 0.910 ==========

Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 8 TRANSACTION AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY ACQUISITIONS During the second quarter, the Aimco-CalSTRS joint venture acquired two student properties for a total of $15.9 million, or $5.3 million for Aimco's one-third interest. The properties are located in Hayward, California and Lawrence, Kansas and have 152 and 254 units, respectively. In addition, the joint venture acquired from Aimco a student property located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with 336 units for $16.3 million. Aimco also purchased interests in 56 partnerships owning 179 properties for an aggregate of $3.7 million. DISPOSITIONS Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet long-term investment criteria and seeks to sell these properties. During the second quarter, Aimco sold 23 properties including 6,211 apartment units for $249 million in gross proceeds, generating net cash proceeds to Aimco of $89 million after payment of mortgage debt and limited partner interests. Of the properties sold, 18 were conventional and five were affordable. Year-to-date, Aimco has sold 41 properties including 10,120 apartment units for $376 million in gross proceeds. See the chart below for additional information on disposition activity. The FCF Yield is calculated as the FCF earned by the properties during the 12 months prior to their sale divided by the sales price. FCF includes a $525 per unit deduction for Capital Replacements and is before debt service. SECOND QUARTER PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY Aimco is currently marketing for sale 107 conventional properties (approximately 26,500 units) and 134 affordable properties (approximately 12,000 units). Aimco anticipates gross sales proceeds of approximately $525 to $625 million through the remainder of 2003. Aimco expects that its share of cash from these dispositions, net of limited partner interests and after repayment of mortgage debt, will be approximately $120 to $160 million. [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 9 REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY At quarter-end, Aimco had seven conventional redevelopment properties with 3,326 units, and two affordable properties with 467 units, undergoing redevelopment. Redevelopment expenditures in the quarter were $24 million, of which Aimco's share was $16 million. Redevelopment expenditures for these seven conventional projects are expected to total $374 million, including unconsolidated interests, of which approximately $21 million remains to be spent. Aimco's share of total redevelopment spending is $289 million, of which approximately $14 million remains to be spent. Aimco's largest redevelopment project is Flamingo Resort Residences with 1,687 apartments located in Miami Beach, Florida. During the quarter, 246 additional units were completed for a total of 1,061 completed units and 626 units under redevelopment. Final completion, including all units, commercial areas, north pool and fitness center, is expected by year-end 2003. At quarter-end, occupied and pre-leased units totaled 839. Calhoun Beach Club, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, reached stabilization in May and had occupancy of 92% at quarter-end. Meadow Creek, located in Boulder, Colorado, had occupancy of 86% in June and has since reached stabilization. BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY FINANCING ACTIVITY During the second quarter, Aimco closed 34 conventional property mortgage loans generating $272.3 million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.17%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners totaling $204.7 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $67.6 million. SECOND QUARTER MORTGAGE REFINANCINGS ($mm) At quarter-end, Aimco's consolidated mortgage debt was $5,716 million. During the quarter Aimco closed on a $250 million five-year term loan. Proceeds were applied to pay down the [AIMCO LOGO]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2003 - Page 10 outstanding balance on Aimco's $445 million revolving credit facility. Aimco's revolving credit facility had a zero balance at quarter-end. Aimco's pro rata share of mortgage debt (including total consolidated debt, less the minority interest portion and its share of unconsolidated debt) was $5,608 million at quarter-end (see Supplemental Schedule V for detail). This total had a weighted average maturity of 15 years and weighted average interest rate of 6.2%, down from 6.5% at year-end 2002. Further, 83% was fixed rate debt and 17% was floating rate debt. Seventy-eight percent of floating rate debt was tax-exempt mortgage debt. Total debt was reduced by $176 million during the quarter. CAPITAL STRUCTURE AT JUNE 30, 2003 (1) Aimco share of debt excluding the minority interest in consolidated debt, see Supplemental Schedule V (2) 106.022 million shares and units outstanding at June 30, 2003 times the closing price of $34.60 per share On June 30, 2003 Aimco redeemed all outstanding shares of its Class C Cumulative Preferred Stock, payable in cash, for $60.0 million.

GLOSSARY GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures standardly used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): is FFO less both Capital Replacement expenditures and Capital Enhancement expenditures. Similar to FFO, AFFO captures real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. AFFO also reflects that Capital Replacements are necessary to maintain, and Capital Enhancements are made to improve, the associated real estate assets. Please see Supplemental Schedules I and II for AFFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS (CR & CE): are components of total capital expenditures. CR expenditures are required to maintain Aimco's assets and CE expenditures are made to improve Aimco's assets by adding a new feature or revenue source. CR and CE spending are components of capital expenditures denoted as line items in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows. DISPOSITION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: are capital expenditures made on properties sold, held for sale or identified as to be sold within one year. Disposition capital expenditures are incurred to support the sale of these properties and are not part of Aimco's ongoing Capital Replacements. Prior to establishing this category of capital expenditures, these expenditures were accounted for as Capital Replacements and deducted in calculating AFFO. Aimco will review this allocation each quarter and will re-allocate to Capital Replacements any items for those properties not sold or no longer identified as to be sold. FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF, as defined by Aimco, is net operating income from real estate minus Capital Replacement spending required to maintain, and Capital Enhancement spending made to improve, the related assets. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the Investment Management Business, Interest and Other Income, General and Administrative expenses and other expenses incurred by Aimco. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. Because Aimco has substantial
unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows as related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings. Please see Supplemental Schedule II for FCF data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, dispositions of depreciable real estate property, dispositions of real estate from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. Aimco calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for the minority interest in Aimco's operating partnership (AIMCO Properties, L.P.), plus amortization of intangibles, plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends/distributions on preferred stock/partnership units. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends/distributions relating to convertible securities the conversion of which is dilutive to FFO. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Please see Supplemental Schedules I and II for FFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP. NET RENTAL INCOME: is an operating measure calculated as the product of rental units in Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio multiplied by occupancy and average rent per unit. SAME STORE: is used commonly to describe conventional properties in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. Please see Supplemental Schedules VIII through XIII for Same Store data reconciled to Net Operating Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
UNCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS: such as Aimco's share of unconsolidated cash, unconsolidated restricted cash, unconsolidated accounts receivable and unconsolidated debt are components of Balance Sheet line items on the GAAP Financial Statements that are useful in understanding Aimco's proportionate share of assets and liabilities, prior to consolidation in GAAP financial statements.
