Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Lender severally agrees to Convert and Continue Loans until the Maturity Date as Borrowers may from time to time request in an amount not to exceed the amount of the Commitment of such Lender, and the aggregate of all commitments shall not exceed the Combined Commitments at any time. Subject to the foregoing and the other terms and conditions hereof, Borrowers may Convert, Continue, and prepay Loans until the Maturity Date as set forth herein without premium or penalty. (b) Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more loan accounts or records maintained by such Lender in the Ordinary Course of Business.

Such loan accounts, records or Notes shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of such Loans and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrowers to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans. 2.02 BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF COMMITTED LOANS. (a) From time to time, Borrowers may irrevocably request a Borrowing, Conversion or Continuation of Committed Loans in a Minimum Amount therefor by delivering a Request for Extension of Credit therefor by Requisite Notice to Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor. Immediately after any telephonic notice of a Borrowing, Borrowers shall provide Administrative Agent with a written notice thereof, signed by a Responsible Officer. All Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations shall constitute Base Rate Loans unless properly and timely otherwise designated as set forth in the prior sentence. (b) Following receipt of a Request for Extension of Credit, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of its Pro Rata Share thereof by Requisite Notice. In the case of a Borrowing of Loans, each Lender shall make the funds for its Loan available to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office not later than the Requisite Time therefor on the Business Day specified in such Request for Extension of Credit. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in SECTION 4, all funds so received shall be made available to Borrowers in like funds received. (c) Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrowers and Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan upon determination of same. (d) Except as otherwise provided herein, an Offshore Rate Loan may be Continued or Converted only on the last day of the Interest Period for such Offshore Rate Loan. No Loans may be requested as, Converted into or Continued as Offshore Rate Loans during the existence of a Default or Event of Default. During the existence of a Default or Event of Default, the Requisite Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Offshore Rate Loans be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the applicable Interest Period. Such Conversion shall be effective upon the last day of the applicable Interest Period and after notice has been given to Borrowers and shall continue so long as such Default or Event of Default continues to exist. (e) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation to make a Loan on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan. 2.03 PREPAYMENTS. (a) Voluntary Prepayments. Upon Requisite Notice to Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor, Borrowers may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, in at least the Minimum Amount therefor or in full without 38
premium or penalty. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. Any prepayment of an Offshore Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with the costs set forth in Section 3.05. (b) Application of Prepayments. (i) Unless otherwise instructed by Borrowers, any prepayments pursuant to SECTION 2.03(a) made (1) on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for any Loan shall be applied first to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to any Offshore Rate Loans then outstanding, in the forward order of such Offshore Rate Loans' stated maturities and (2) on the last day of an Interest Period for any Offshore Rate Loan shall be applied first to such maturing Offshore Rate Loan, then to any Base Rate Loans outstanding, and then to any other Offshore Rate Loans then outstanding, in the forward order of such Offshore Rate Loans' stated maturities. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained herein, upon the occurrence of a Payment Default (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and during the continuation thereof, each payment received pursuant to this SECTION 2.03 shall be applied in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. 2.04 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]. 2.05 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST; DEFAULT RATE. (a) If not sooner paid (including prepayments pursuant to SECTION 2.03), Borrowers agree to pay the outstanding principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date. (b) Subject to subsection (e) below, Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan (before, during and after a Default or an Event of Default, before and after maturity, before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws) from the date borrowed until paid in full (whether by acceleration or otherwise) on each applicable Interest Payment Date at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate determined in accordance with the definition of such type of Loan. (c) Each Offshore Rate Loan shall bear interest for each day during the Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to the Offshore Rate determined for such day plus 275 basis points per annum. (d) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 105 basis points per annum. (e) If any amount payable by any Borrower Party under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), it shall thereafter bear interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including, without limitation, interest on past due interest) shall be payable upon demand. 39
2.06 FEES. Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent certain fees as and when designated in the certain fee letters by and between Borrowers and Administrative Agent. 2.07 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Computation of interest on Offshore Rate Loans and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to Lenders than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest on all Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365/366 days and the actual number of days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, PROVIDED that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. 2.08 MAKING PAYMENTS. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments by Borrowers or any Lender shall be made to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office not later than the Requisite Time for such type of payment. All payments received after such Requisite Time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments by Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. (b) Upon satisfaction of any applicable terms and conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly make any amounts received in accordance with the prior subsection available in like funds received as follows: (i) if payable to Borrowers, by crediting the Designated Deposit Account, and (ii) if payable to any Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender at the address specified in Schedule 10.02, as amended from time to time by such Lender. (c) Subject to the definition of "Interest Period," if any payment to be made by any Borrower Party shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding Business Day. (d) Unless a Borrower or any Lender has notified Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment to be made by it is due, that it does not intend to remit such payment, Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, assume that Borrowers or Lender, as the case may be, have timely remitted such payment and may, in its discretion and in reliance thereon, make available such payment to the Person entitled thereto. If such payment was not in fact remitted to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then: (i) if Borrowers failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including 40
the date such amount was made available by Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Rate; and (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent promptly shall notify Borrowers, and Borrowers shall pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover from such Lender interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by Administrative Agent to Borrowers to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the daily Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which Administrative Agent or Borrowers may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 2.09 FUNDING SOURCES. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 2.10 COLLATERAL. The payment and performance of the Obligations are and shall be secured by the Pledged Collateral subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Borrowers Pledge Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. SECTION 3. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 3.01 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by Borrowers to or for the account of Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of Administrative Agent and any Lender, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which Administrative Agent or such Lender is organized, maintains a Lending Office or otherwise does business, or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as a "Tax" or "Taxes"). If Borrowers shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender 41
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made (such increase, an "Additional Amount"); (ii) Borrowers shall make such deductions, (iii) Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) Borrowers shall furnish to Administrative Agent (who shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (b) In addition, Borrowers agree to pay any and all present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES"). (c) Borrowers agree to indemnify Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by Administrative Agent and such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted unless and except to the extent such Taxes or Other Taxes were imposed solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be. (d) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "FOREIGN LENDER") agrees that: (i) such Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN ("Form W-8BEN") or any successor thereto (relating to such Person and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI ("Form W-8ECI") or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent that such Person is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Person shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrowers make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Person. If such Person fails to deliver the above forms or other documentation, 42
then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction. (ii) such Lender shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any event (including the passing of time but excluding any event mentioned in (i) above) requiring a change in or renewal of the most recent Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI previously delivered by such Lender, deliver to Borrowers through Administrative Agent two (2) accurate and complete original signed copies of Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, as appropriate, in replacement of the forms previously delivered by such Lender; and (iii) such Lender shall, promptly upon Borrowers' reasonable request to that effect, deliver to Borrowers such other forms or similar documentation as may be required from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation in order to establish such Lender's tax status for withholding purposes. (e) Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Additional Amounts in respect of United States Federal or state income tax pursuant to this Section 3.01 to any Lender or any duly appointed assignee for the account of any Lending Office of such Lender or assignee: (i) if the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts arises as a result of a failure by such Lender or assignee to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 in respect of such Lending Office; (ii) if such Lender or assignee shall have delivered to Borrowers a Form W-8BEN in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to this Section 3.01, and such Lender or assignee shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by Borrowers hereunder for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8BEN; or (iii) if such Lender or assignee shall have delivered to Borrowers a Form W-8ECI in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to this Section 3.01, and such Lender or assignee shall not at any time be entitled to reduction, partial exemption or exemption from deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax in respect of payments by Borrowers hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law, treaty or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8ECI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an assignee subject to U.S. withholding taxes shall be entitled to receive Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 3.01(a) to the same extent that such assignee's assignor was entitled to receive such Additional Amounts. 43
(f) If, at any time, Borrowers request any Lender to deliver any forms or other documentation pursuant to this Section 3.01, then Borrowers shall, on demand of such Lender, through Administrative Agent reimburse such Lender for any costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) reasonably incurred by such Lender in the preparation or delivery of such forms or other documentation. (g) If Borrowers are required to pay Additional Amounts to Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01, then such Lender shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by Borrowers which may thereafter accrue if such change in the judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Laws have made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Offshore Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore Dollar market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Offshore Rate, then, on notice thereof by Lender to Borrowers through Administrative Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make Offshore Rate Loans shall be suspended until Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay or Convert all Offshore Rate Loans of that Lender, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If, in connection with any Extension of Credit involving any Offshore Rate Loan, Administrative Agent determines that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of the requested Offshore Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the underlying interest rate for such Offshore Rate Loan, or (c) such underlying interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lender of funding such Offshore Rate Loan, Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrowers and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of all Lenders to make or maintain such Offshore Rate Loan shall be suspended until Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of Offshore Rate Loans or, failing that, be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 44
3.04 INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY. (a) If any Lender determines that any Laws: (i) subject such Lender to any Tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Offshore Rate Loans or its obligation to make Offshore Rate Loans, or change the basis on which Taxes are imposed on any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement in respect of any Offshore Rate Loans; (ii) shall impose or modify any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement (other than the reserve requirement utilized in the determination of the Offshore Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (including its Commitment); or (iii) shall impose on such Lender or on the offshore Dollar interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, Converting into, Continuing, or maintaining any Offshore Rate Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement with respect to any Offshore Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Administrative Agent), Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If any Lender determines that any change in or the interpretation of any Laws have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. 3.05 BREAKFUNDING COSTS.

Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or Lenders provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, or the other Loan Documents, or by applicable Law, or in equity, or otherwise: (a) upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default other than an Event of Default described in Section 8.01(j), Supermajority Lenders may request Administrative Agent to, and Administrative Agent thereupon shall, terminate the Commitments and/or declare all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the same shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without protest, presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers; (b) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 8.01(j): (i) the Commitments and all other obligations of Administrative Agent or Lenders to Borrowers (other than the confidentiality provisions of Section 10.17, and the Lenders' agreement to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office, as provided in Section 3.01(g), and to designate a different Lending Office, as provided in Section 3.02) shall automatically terminate without notice to or demand upon Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers; (ii) the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents shall be forthwith due and payable, without protest, presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers; (c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lenders and Administrative Agent, or any of them, without notice to (except as expressly provided for in any Loan Document) or demand upon Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers (except as to notices expressly provided for in any Loan Document), may proceed to (but only with the consent of Supermajority Lenders) protect, exercise and enforce their rights and remedies under 81
the Loan Documents against any Borrower Party and such other rights and remedies as are provided by Law or equity, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (d) Except as permitted by Section 10.05, no Lender may exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Obligations without the consent of Supermajority Lenders in their sole discretion, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The order and manner in which Administrative Agent's and Lenders' rights and remedies are to be exercised shall be determined by Supermajority Lenders in their sole discretion. Regardless of how a Lender may treat payments for the purpose of its own accounting, for the purpose of computing the Obligations hereunder, payments shall be applied FIRST, to costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Administrative Agent and each Lender, SECOND, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans to and including the date of such application, THIRD, to the payment of the unpaid principal of the Loans, and FOURTH, to the payment of all other amounts (including fees) then owing to Administrative Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents, in each case paid pro rata to Administrative Agent and each Lender in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations owed to Administrative Agent and each Lender under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed under the Loan Documents to Administrative Agent and all Lenders, without priority or preference among Administrative Agent and Lenders. No application of payments will cure any Event of Default, or prevent acceleration, or continued acceleration, of amounts payable under the Loan Documents, or prevent the exercise, or continued exercise, of rights or remedies of Administrative Agent and Lenders hereunder or thereunder or at Law or in equity. SECTION 9. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 9.01 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to SECTION 9.09) appoints, designates and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with reference to Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. 82
9.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. 9.03 LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. None of Administrative Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrowers, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of Borrowers or any other party to any Loan Document to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of Borrowers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 9.04 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such Note shall have been transferred in accordance with Section 10.04 and all actions required by such Section in connection with such transfer shall have been taken. Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Requisite Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders, if required hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of Lenders. 83
(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in SECTION 4.01, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by Administrative Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender. 9.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders, unless Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Borrowers referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". Administrative Agent will notify Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with SECTION 8; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until Administrative Agent has received any such request, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of Lenders. 9.06 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that none of Administrative Agent-Related Persons or Sole Lead Arranger has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Administrative Agent-Related Person or the Sole Lead Arranger to any Lender as to any matter, including without limitation, whether Administrative Agent-Related Persons or the Sole Lead Arranger, as the case may be, have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender, including any Lender by assignment, represents to Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person or the Sole Lead Arranger and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person or the Sole Lead Arranger and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to Lenders by Administrative Agent herein, 84
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of any of Administrative Agent-Related Persons or the Sole Lead Arranger. 9.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Administrative Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Administrative Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Administrative Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Administrative Agent after the Closing Date in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrowers. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent. 9.08 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though it were not Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of Lenders. Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding Borrowers or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. 9.09 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Supermajority Lenders shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lenders. If Administrative 85
Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Requisite Lenders shall appoint from among Lenders a successor administrative agent for Lenders, and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such successor administrative agent shall require the approval of Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with Lenders and Borrowers, a successor administrative agent from among Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT" shall mean such successor administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this SECTION 9 and SECTIONS 10.03 and 10.13 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS 10.01 AMENDMENTS; CONSENTS. No amendment, modification, supplement, extension, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no approval or consent thereunder, and no consent to any departure by any Borrower Party therefrom shall be effective unless in writing signed by Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) without the approval in writing of Administrative Agent and Supermajority Lenders, no amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent may be effective to amend the provisions of SECTION 7.14 while all or any portion of the Casden Loan is outstanding, SECTIONS 7.14(a), (c), (e) or (f) after repayment of the Casden Loan in full, or SECTION 8 or to amend any provision of this Agreement that expressly requires the consent or approval of Supermajority Lenders, and (ii) without the approval in writing of Administrative Agent and all Lenders, no amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent may be effective to the extent it involves a material change to any material provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or causes any of the following to occur: (a) To reduce the amount of any scheduled payment of principal, principal prepayments or the rate of interest payable on, any Loan, or the amount of any fee or other amount payable to any Lender under the Loan Documents (unless such modification is consented to by each Lender entitled to receive such fee ) or to waive an Event of Default consisting of the failure of Borrowers to pay when due principal, interest or any commitment fee; or 86
(b) To postpone any date fixed for any scheduled payment of principal of, prepayment of principal of, or any installment of interest on, any Loan or any installment of any commitment fee, to extend the term of, or increase the amount of, any Lender's Commitment (it being understood that a waiver of an Event of Default shall not constitute an extension or increase in the Commitment of any Lender) or modify the Pro Rata Share of any Lender; or (c) To amend the provisions of the definition of "Requisite Lenders", "Supermajority Lenders", SECTION 9 or this SECTION 10.01; or (d) To amend any provision of this Agreement that expressly requires the consent or approval of all Lenders; or (e) To (i) release Liens granted in favor of Collateral Agent with respect to any material portion of the Pledged Collateral, other than in connection with dispositions of such Pledged Collateral permitted under this Agreement or the Collateral Documents and provided that the proceeds of any such disposition are applied as required to be applied under this Agreement, or (ii) release any Guarantor which is a Material Entity from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty, provided that such Guarantor may be released by Administrative Agent in the event (1) such Guarantor is dissolved, merged, consolidated, liquidated, or wound-up as specifically provided in SECTIONS 6.04 or 7.03 and after giving effect to such dissolution, merger, consolidation, liquidation or winding-up, Borrowers remain in compliance with the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, or (2) there is a sale of the Stock of such Guarantor which complies with the terms of this Agreement, and after giving effect to such sale, Borrowers remain in compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any fee letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed by the parties thereto. Any amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent pursuant to this Section shall apply equally to, and shall be binding upon, all Lenders and Administrative Agent. 10.02 TRANSMISSION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF NOTICES AND SIGNATURES. (a) MODES OF DELIVERY. Except as otherwise provided in any Loan Document, notices, requests, demands, directions, agreements and documents delivered in connection with the Loan Documents (collectively, "COMMUNICATIONS") shall be transmitted by Requisite Notice to the number and address set forth on SCHEDULE 10.02, may be delivered by the following modes of delivery, and shall be effective as follows: 87

(c) EFFECTIVENESS OF ELECTRONIC AND FACSIMILE SIGNATURES. Signatures on communications may be transmitted by facsimile, electronic mail or other digital transmission only with the consent of Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, in each instance. The effectiveness of any such signatures accepted by Administrative Agent shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manual signatures and shall be binding on all Borrower Parties and Administrative Agent and Lenders. Administrative Agent may also require that any such signature be confirmed by a manually-signed hardcopy thereof. 10.03 ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. Borrowers agree (a) to pay or reimburse Administrative Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of the Loan Documents, and the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of any amendment, waiver, consent, supplement or modification to, any Loan Documents, and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, all Attorney Costs and the charges of Intralinks or any other electronic document distribution service; and (b) to pay or reimburse Administrative Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any refinancing, restructuring, reorganization (including a bankruptcy reorganization) and enforcement or attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights under any Loan Documents, and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, or in connection with any refinancing, or restructuring of any such documents in the nature of a "workout" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, including, without limitation, Attorney Costs.

Any amount payable by Borrowers under this Section shall bear interest from the second Business Day following the date of demand for payment at the Default Rate, unless waived by Administrative Agent. The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of all Obligations. 10.04 BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT. (a) GENERALLY. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; PROVIDED that none of the Borrower Parties may assign and transfer any of their interests without the prior written consent of all the Lenders and Administrative Agent; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant participants in its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be limited as set forth below in this Section 10.04. (b) ASSIGNMENTS. Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Loans, its Notes, and its Commitment); PROVIDED HOWEVER, that: (i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee; (ii) except (A) in the case of an assignment to another Lender, (B) in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, or (C) with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, any such partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to the applicable Minimum Amount (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Commitment being assigned by such Lender) or an integral multiple of the applicable Minimum Amount in excess thereof and in the case of a partial assignment, such assigning Lender shall retain a minimum Commitment of $500,000; (iii) each such assignment by a Lender shall be of a constant, and not varying, percentage of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes; (iv) the parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the Borrowers for their acceptance an Assignment and Acceptance in substantially the form of Exhibit D, together with a processing fee from the assignor of $3,500; and (v) such assignment, if not to a Lender or an Affiliate of an assigning Lender, shall require the approval of Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of a Default or Event of Default and Administrative Agent (which approval of Borrowers or Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and if Borrowers do not respond during such ten (10) Business Days after receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance, such assignment shall be deemed approved. Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits of a Lender hereunder 89
and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section 10.04(b), the assignor, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, new Notes are issued to the assignor and the assignee. If the assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 3.01. By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance in accordance with this Section 10.04(b), the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (A) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and the assignee warrants that it is an Eligible Assignee; (B) except as set forth in clause (A) above, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto, or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto or the financial condition of any Borrower Party or the performance or observance by any Borrower Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (C) such assignee represents and warrants that it is legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (D) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such assignment agreement; (E) such assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (F) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement or any other Loan Document as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be performed by it as a Lender. (c) REGISTER. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the 90
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance; thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated Assignee, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled." The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) ACCEPTANCE. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by the parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such assignment and payment of the processing fee, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment Agreement has been completed and is in substantially the form of EXHIBIT D, (i) accept such Assignment Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the parties thereto. (e) PARTICIPATIONS. Each Lender may, without notice to or consent of Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more Persons (each a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and its Loans); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of the right of set-off contained in Section 10.05, (iv) the Borrowers and Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (v) such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers relating to their Loans and its Notes and to approve any amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications, or waivers decreasing the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on such Loans or Notes, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on such Loans or Notes, extending its Commitment, releasing all or substantially all of the Pledged Collateral or releasing the Borrowers or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from its or their respective obligations under the Loan Documents). (f) NONRESTRICTED ASSIGNMENTS. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to the Regulation A and any Operating 91
Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder. (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans may at anytime assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and other documents ancillary thereto to its trustee as security in support of its obligations to its trustee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any transfer to any Person upon enforcement of such pledge or security interest may only be made subject to the assignment provisions of this SECTION 10.04. 10.05 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and Lenders or any assignee or participant of Lenders or any Affiliates thereof (each, a "PROCEEDING PARTY") provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Proceeding Party is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to Borrowers, any such notice being waived by Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by law, to proceed directly, by right of set-off, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets of the Borrower Parties which may be in the hands of such Proceeding Party (including all general or special, time or demand, provisional or other deposits and other indebtedness owing by such Proceeding Party to or for the credit or the account of Borrowers) and apply such assets against the Obligations, irrespective of whether such Proceeding Party shall have made any demand therefor and although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrowers and Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 10.06 SHARING OF PAYMENT. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each Lender severally agrees that if it, through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim against Borrowers, or otherwise, receives payment of the Obligations held by it that is ratably more than any other Lender, through any means, receives in payment of the Obligations held by that Lender, then, subject to applicable Laws: (a) Lender exercising the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or otherwise receiving such payment shall purchase, and shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased, from the other Lenders a participation in the Obligations held by the other Lenders and shall pay to the other Lenders a purchase price in an amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each Lender after the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment shall be in the same proportion that existed prior to the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment; and (b) such other adjustments and purchases of participations shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure that all Lenders share any payment obtained in respect of the Obligations ratably in accordance with each Lender's share of the Obligations immediately prior to, and without taking into account, the payment; PROVIDED that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate payment obtained as a result of the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender by Borrowers or 92
any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of Borrowers, the purchase of a participation shall be rescinded and the purchase price thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery, but without interest. Each Lender that purchases a participation in the Obligations pursuant to this Section shall from and after the purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. Borrowers expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any Lender holding a participation in an Obligation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim with respect to the participation as fully as if Lender were the original owner of the Obligation purchased. 10.07 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. (a) No failure by any Lender or Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any Lender or Administrative Agent in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under any Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. (b) The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein or therein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law. Any decision by Administrative Agent or any Lender not to require payment of any interest (including Default Interest), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document or to calculate any amount payable by a particular method on any occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a waiver of Administrative Agent's or such Lender's right to require full payment thereof, or to calculate an amount payable by another method that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, on any other or subsequent occasion. (c) The terms and conditions of Section 9 are inserted for the sole benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders; the same may be waived in whole or in part, with or without terms or conditions, in respect of any Extension of Credit without prejudicing Administrative Agent's or Lenders' rights to assert them in whole or in part in respect of any other Loan. 10.08 USURY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest and fees paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "MAXIMUM RATE"). If Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest or a fee in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excessive interest or fee shall be applied to the principal of the Outstanding Obligations or, if it exceeds the unpaid principal, refunded to Borrowers. In determining whether the interest or a fee contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, 93
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations. 10.09 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with Borrowers and the Administrative Agent. 10.10 INTEGRATION; CONFLICTS WITH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents and any letter agreements referred to herein, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on the subject matter hereof. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties hereto. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control and govern; PROVIDED that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of Administrative Agent or Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 10.11 NATURE OF LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and not joint or joint and several. Nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by Administrative Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to, make Lenders a partnership, an association, a joint venture or other entity, either among themselves or with Borrowers or any Affiliate of Borrowers. Each Lender's obligation to make the initial Loan is conditioned upon the performance by all other Lenders of their obligations to make initial Loans. A default by any Lender will not increase the Pro Rata Share attributable to any other Lender. 10.12 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any Loan Document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery thereof but shall terminate on the later of (a) when the Commitments are terminated and (b) when no Obligations remain outstanding under any Loan Document. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by Administrative Agent and each Lender, notwithstanding any investigation made by Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrowers set forth in SECTION 3 and SUBSECTIONS 10.03, 10.05, 10.13, and 10.14 and the agreements of Lenders 94
set forth in SUBSECTIONS 9.03, 9.07, 10.06 and 11.01(f) shall survive the payment of the other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 10.13 INDEMNITY BY BORROWERS. Borrowers agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless Administrative Agent-Related Persons and each Lender and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, attorneys and employees, or any holding company thereof (collectively the "INDEMNITEES") from and against: (a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action, including, without limitation, any environmental claims, actions, demands or causes of action (except a claim, demand, action, or cause of action for Taxes of Lenders) if the claim, demand, action or cause of action arises out of or relates to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other such documents, including, without limitation, any act or omission (or alleged act or omission) of any Borrower Party, its Affiliates or any of their officers, directors or stockholders relating to the Commitments, the use or contemplated use of proceeds of any Loan, or the relationship of any Borrower Party and Lenders under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the granting of any pledge or security interest in the Pledged Collateral; (b) any administrative or investigative proceeding by any Governmental Authority arising out of or related to a claim, demand, action or cause of action described in subsection (a) above; and (c) any and all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, disbursements, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever (including settlement costs or Attorney Costs) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action or cause of action thereto, including those liabilities caused by an Indemnitee's own negligence (all the foregoing, collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); PROVIDED that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any loss caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any loss asserted against it by another Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unauthorized persons of Information or other materials sent through electronic telecommunications or other information transmission systems that are intercepted by such persons or for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in connection with the Loans. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers agree not to assert and to cause their Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause their Subsidiaries so to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee. 10.14 NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (a) It has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (b) Any inspections of any Property of Borrowers made by or through Administrative Agent or Lenders are for purposes of administration of the Loan Documents only, 95
and Borrowers are not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or not such inspections are at the expense of Borrowers); (c) By accepting or approving anything required to be observed, performed, fulfilled or given to Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents, neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by Administrative Agent or Lenders; (d) The relationship between Borrowers and Administrative Agent and Lenders is, and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrowers and lenders; neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall under any circumstance be construed to be partners or joint venturers of Borrowers or their Affiliates; neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall under any circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence or trust or a fiduciary relationship with Borrowers or their Affiliates, or to owe any fiduciary duty to Borrowers or their Affiliates; neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders undertake or assume any responsibility or duty to Borrowers or their Affiliates to select, review, inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrowers or their Affiliates of any matter in connection with their Property or the operations of Borrowers or their Affiliates; Borrowers and their Affiliates shall rely entirely upon their own judgment with respect to such matters; and any review, inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment or supply of information undertaken or assumed by Administrative Agent or Lenders in connection with such matters is solely for the protection of Administrative Agent and Lenders and none of Borrowers nor any other Person is entitled to rely thereon; and (e) Administrative Agent and Lenders shall not be responsible or liable to any Person for any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind relating to injury or death to Persons or damage to Property caused by the actions, inaction or negligence of Borrowers and/or their Affiliates and Borrowers hereby indemnify and holds Administrative Agent and Lenders harmless from any such loss, damage, liability or claim. 10.15 NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made for the purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Lenders in connection with the Loans, and is made for the sole benefit of Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Lenders, and Administrative Agent's and Lenders' successors and assigns. Except as provided in SECTIONS 10.04 and 10.13, no other Person shall have any rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof. 10.16 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of the Loan Documents that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition 96

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

(f) Joint and Several Liability of Borrowers.

(ii) Each of Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including, without limitation, any Obligations arising under this Section 10.25), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them. (iii) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Borrower will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation. (iv) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 10.25 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each 101
Borrower enforceable against each such Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever. (v) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any Loans issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of Default, or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or Lenders under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement). Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by the Administrative Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by the Administrative Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section 10.25 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 10.25, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such Borrower under this Section 10.25 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 10.25 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any Borrower or the Administrative Agent or Lender. The joint and several liability of each Borrower hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the name, constitution or place of formation of any of the Borrowers or Administrative Agent or Lenders. (vi) The provisions of this Section 10.25 are made for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Administrative Agent, or any Lender, successor or assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 10.25 shall 102
remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 10.25 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made. (vii) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to the Administrative Agent or Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may have against the other Borrowers with respect to any payments to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, including without limitation, as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to the other Borrowers therefor. 10.26 LENDER COVENANT. Each Lender hereby covenants and agrees that it shall notify Administrative Agent, in writing, immediately upon becoming a Casden Lender and/or a Revolver Lender and upon any Affiliate becoming a Casden Lender and/or a Revolver Lender. 10.27 RELEASE OF COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, upon request of Borrowers in connection with any Disposition of Property permitted by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) cause the Collateral Agent to take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in any Pledged Collateral being Disposed of in such Disposition, and to release any guarantee obligations under any Loan Document of any Person being Disposed of in such Disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when all Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments have terminated or expired, upon request of Borrowers, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) cause the Collateral Agent to take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Pledged Collateral (on behalf of the Term Lenders only), and to release all guarantee obligations under any Loan Document (on behalf of the Term Lenders only). Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the 103
provision that such guarantee obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Borrowers or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, Borrowers or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. SECTION 11. COLLATERAL AGENT 11.01 COLLATERAL AGENT. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Bank of America as Collateral Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral Documents with such powers as are specifically granted to the Collateral Agent by the terms thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and expressly authorizes the Collateral Agent as its agent to execute, deliver and perform the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to act as Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents (subject to and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), and the Intercreditor Agreement and Bank of America, in its individual capacity, accepts such appointment as Collateral Agent thereunder by executing the Borrowers Pledge Agreement, which appointment is coupled with an interest. Each Lender hereby agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to a "Lender" therein. (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or the Collateral Documents, Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in this Section 11, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, nor shall Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in the Collateral Documents with reference to Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. (c) Collateral Agent may execute any of its duties under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. (d) None of Collateral Agent-Related Persons (defined below) shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby 104
(except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrowers, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or for any failure of Borrowers or any other party to any Loan Document to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Collateral Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of Borrowers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates. "Collateral Agent-Related Persons" means Collateral Agent (including any successor agent), together with its Affiliates (including, in the case of Collateral Agent, Banc of America Securities LLC), and the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of such Persons and Affiliates. (e) Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by Collateral Agent. Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Requisite Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with a request or consent of the Requisite Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of Lenders. (f) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Collateral Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Pledgors (as defined in the Borrowers Pledge Agreement) and without limiting the obligation of Pledgors to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Collateral Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Collateral Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no action taken in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Collateral Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Collateral Agent after the Closing Date in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or any document contemplated by or referred to therein, to the extent that Collateral 105
Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrower Parties. The undertaking in this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Collateral Agent. (g) Collateral Agent may, and at the request of 66-2/3% of the Benefited Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall, resign as Collateral Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lenders. If Collateral Agent resigns under the Collateral Documents and Intercreditor Agreement, the Majority Benefited Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall appoint from among the Casden Lenders, Lenders or Revolver Lenders, a successor collateral agent, and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such successor collateral agent shall require the approval of Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); PROVIDED, THAT, if no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent may appoint, after consulting with such Lenders and Borrowers, a successor collateral agent from among such Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent and the term "Collateral Agent" shall mean such successor collateral agent and the retiring Collateral Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and Intercreditor Agreement shall be terminated. After any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement as the collateral agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. If no successor collateral agent has accepted appointment as Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Collateral Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Collateral Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and Majority Benefited Parties shall perform all of the duties of Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Benefited Parties appoint a successor collateral agent as provided for above.

Exhibit 10.2 PAYMENT GUARANTY This PAYMENT GUARANTY ("GUARANTY") is made as of May 30, 2003, by the undersigned entities (each a "GUARANTOR") in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. ("BANK OF AMERICA"), as Administrative Agent for itself and the lenders ("LENDERS") from time to time party to the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (in such capacity, "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT"). FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Lenders have made or intend to make a $250,000,000 credit facility available to Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("REIT"), AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("AIMCO"), AIMCO/Bethesda Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AIMCO/BETHESDA"), and NHP Management Company, a District of Columbia corporation ("NHP MANAGEMENT") (the REIT, AIMCO, AIMCO/Bethesda and NHP Management are collectively referred to as "BORROWERS"), in accordance with the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), dated as of the date hereof, by and among Borrowers, Bank of America (as Administrative Agent), Banc of America Securities LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and as Sole Bookrunner, and the other Lenders from time to time party thereto. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers have obtained this Guaranty from the Guarantors. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. As used herein, the term "FACILITY" shall refer individually to the credit facility available to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement. GUARANTY 1. GUARANTY OF LOAN (a) ABSOLUTE GUARANTY. Each Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to Administrative Agent and the Lenders the full payment of the Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), and unconditionally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders the full amount of the Indebtedness. This is a guaranty of payment, not of collection. If Borrowers default in the payment when due of the Indebtedness or any part of it, each Guarantor will in lawful money of the United States pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on demand, all sums due and owing on the Indebtedness, including all interest, charges, fees and other sums, costs and expenses. (b) Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the "FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS"), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (x) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to Borrowers or other affiliates of Borrowers to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (y) under any guaranty of subordinated Indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 1, pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement. 1
2. LOAN. In this Guaranty, the term "Indebtedness" is broadly defined to mean and include all primary, secondary, direct, indirect, fixed and contingent obligations of Borrowers to pay principal, interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under debtor relief laws at the rate or in the amount otherwise applicable thereto whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in any such proceeding), prepayment charges, breakage costs, late charges, loan fees and any other fees, charges, sums, costs and expenses that may be owing at any time under the Loan Documents, as any or all of such obligations may from time to time be modified, amended, extended or renewed. If the amount outstanding under the Indebtedness is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination shall be conclusive and binding on each Guarantor, regardless of whether such Guarantor was a party to the proceeding in which the determination was made or not. 3. RIGHTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS. Each Guarantor authorizes Administrative Agent or any Lender to perform any or all of the following acts at any time in its sole discretion, all without notice to such Guarantor and without affecting such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty: (a) Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders may alter any terms of the Indebtedness or any part of it, including renewing, compromising, extending or accelerating, or otherwise changing the time for payment of, or increasing or decreasing the rate of interest on, the Indebtedness or any part of it. (b) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may take and hold security for the Indebtedness or this Guaranty, accept additional or substituted security for either, and subordinate, exchange, enforce, waive, release, compromise, fail to perfect and sell or otherwise dispose of any such security in accordance with the terms of the Indebtedness. (c) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may direct the order and manner of any sale of all or any part of any security now or later to be held for the Indebtedness or this Guaranty, and Administrative Agent or any Lender may also bid at any such sale. (d) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may apply any payments or recoveries from Borrowers, Guarantors or any other source, and any proceeds of any security, to Borrowers' obligations under the Loan Documents in such manner, order and priority as Administrative Agent or such Lender may elect, whether or not those obligations are guarantied by this Guaranty or secured at the time of the application. (e) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may release Borrowers of their liability for the Indebtedness or any part of it. (f) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may substitute, add or release any one or more Guarantors, other guarantors or endorsers. (g) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, in addition to the Indebtedness, Administrative Agent or any Lender may extend other credit to Borrowers, and may take and hold security for the credit so extended, all without affecting any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty. 4. GUARANTY TO BE ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that until the Indebtedness is paid and performed in full and each and every term, covenant and condition of this Guaranty is fully performed, such Guarantor shall not be released by or because of: (a) Any act or event (other than payment and performance in full of the Indebtedness) which might otherwise discharge, reduce, limit or modify such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty; (b) Any waiver, extension, modification, forbearance, delay or other act or omission of Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender, or its failure to proceed promptly or otherwise as against Borrowers, any Guarantor or any security; 2
(c) Any action, omission or circumstance that might increase the likelihood that such Guarantor may be called upon to perform under this Guaranty or that might affect the rights or remedies of such Guarantor as against Borrowers; (d) Any dealings occurring at any time between Borrowers and Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether relating to the Indebtedness or otherwise; or (e) Any action of Administrative Agent or any Lender described in Section 3 above. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that absent this Section 4, such Guarantor might have a defense to the enforcement of this Guaranty as a result of one or more of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defense to its liability under this Guaranty based upon any of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. It is the purpose and intent of this Guaranty that the obligations of each Guarantor under it shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. 5. GUARANTORS' WAIVERS. Each Guarantor waives: (a) All statutes of limitations as a defense to any action or proceeding brought against such Guarantor by Administrative Agent or any Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) Any right it may have to require Administrative Agent or any Lender to proceed against Borrowers, proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrowers, or pursue any other remedy in Administrative Agent's or any Lender's power to pursue; (c) Any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrowers; (d) Any defense based on: (i) any legal disability of Borrowers, (ii) any release, discharge, modification, impairment or limitation of the liability of Borrowers to Administrative Agent or any Lender from any cause, whether consented to by Administrative Agent or any Lender or arising by operation of law or from any bankruptcy or other voluntary or involuntary proceeding, in or out of court, for the adjustment of debtor-creditor relationships ("Insolvency Proceeding"), and (iii) any rejection or disaffirmance of the Indebtedness, or any part of it, or any security held for it, in any such Insolvency Proceeding; (e) Any defense based on any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent or any Lender in any Insolvency Proceeding involving Borrowers, including any election to have Administrative Agent's or that Lender's claim allowed as being secured, partially secured or unsecured, any extension of credit by Lender to Borrowers in any Insolvency Proceeding, and the taking and holding by Administrative Agent or any Lender of any security for any such extension of credit; (f) All presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, and demands and notices of every kind except for any demand or notice by Administrative Agent or any Lender to such Guarantor expressly provided for in Section 1; (g) Any defense based on or arising out of any defense that Borrowers may have to the payment or performance of the Indebtedness or any part of it (other than indefeasible payment in full); and (h) Any defense based on or arising out of any action of Administrative Agent or any Lender described in Sections 3 or 4 above. 3
6. WAIVERS OF SUBROGATION AND OTHER RIGHTS. (a) During the existence of an Event of Default, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Collateral Documents, Administrative Agent or any Lender (subject to Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement), without prior notice to or consent of any Guarantor, may elect to: (i) foreclose either judicially or nonjudicially against any real or personal property security it may hold for the Indebtedness, (ii) accept a transfer of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, (iii) compromise or adjust the Indebtedness or any part of it or make any other accommodation with Borrowers or Guarantors, or (iv) exercise any other remedy against Borrowers or any security. No such action by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall release or limit the liability of Guarantors, who shall remain liable under this Guaranty after the action, even if the effect of the action is to deprive Guarantors of any subrogation rights, rights of indemnity, or other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrowers for any sums paid to Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether contractual or arising by operation of law or otherwise. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that under no circumstances shall it be deemed to have any right, title, interest or claim in or to any real or personal property to be held by Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender or any third party after any foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure of any security for the Indebtedness. (b) Regardless of whether any Guarantor may have made any payments to Administrative Agent or any Lender, each Guarantor hereby waives: (i) all rights of subrogation, all rights of indemnity, and any other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrowers for any sums paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether contractual or arising by operation of law (including the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor or similar statute) or otherwise, (ii) all rights to enforce any remedy that Lender may have against Borrowers, and (iii) all rights to participate in any security now or later to be held by Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender for the Indebtedness, in each case until the full and indefeasible payment and performance of all Indebtedness, and all obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. (c) Each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender, even though that election of remedies may affect such Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the Borrowers by the operation of law or otherwise. In addition, each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that such Guarantor may have because the Borrowers' indebtedness is secured by real property. This means, among other things, that Administrative Agent and the Lenders may collect from such Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the Borrowers. 7. REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT. If Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent or any Lender is required to pay, return or restore to Borrowers or any other person any amounts previously paid on the Indebtedness because of any Insolvency Proceeding of Borrowers, any stop notice or any other reason, the obligations of Guarantors shall be reinstated and revived and the rights of Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and such Lender shall continue with regard to such amounts, all as though they had never been paid. 8. INFORMATION REGARDING BORROWERS. Before signing this Guaranty, each Guarantor investigated the financial condition and business operations of Borrowers and such other matters as such Guarantor deemed appropriate to assure itself of Borrowers' ability to discharge their obligations under the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor assumes full responsibility for that due diligence, as well as for keeping informed of all matters that may affect Borrowers' ability to pay and perform their obligations to the Collateral Agent, Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty to disclose to any Guarantor any information which such party may have or receive about Borrowers' financial condition, business operations, or any other circumstances bearing on their ability to perform. 9. SUBORDINATION. Any rights of any Guarantor, whether now existing or later arising, to receive payment on account of any indebtedness (including interest) owed to it by Borrowers or any other Guarantor thereof or to receive any payment from Borrowers or any such other Guarantor other than those payments or distributions permitted under Sections 7.07 and 7.10 of the Credit Agreement shall at all times be subordinate as to lien and time of payment and in all other respects to the full and prior repayment of the Indebtedness. No Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce or receive payment of any sums hereby subordinated until the Indebtedness has been paid 4
and performed in full and any such sums received in violation of this Guaranty shall be received by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. 10. FINANCIAL INFORMATION. Each Guarantor shall keep true and correct financial books and records, using generally accepted accounting principles which are applicable to the circumstances as of the date of determination, or such other accounting principles as the Requisite Lenders in their reasonable judgment may find acceptable from time to time. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants to Administrative Agent and the Lenders that all financial information with respect to such Guarantor delivered or to be delivered to Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrowers with respect to such Guarantor under Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement is or shall be true and correct and fairly presents or will fairly present the financial position of such Guarantor for the applicable period. Each Guarantor shall promptly provide Administrative Agent and the Lenders with any additional audited financial information that such Guarantor may obtain, and such other information concerning its affairs and properties as Administrative Agent or any Lender may reasonably request, including, without limitation, signed copies of any tax returns if requested by Administrative Agent or the Lenders. 11. GUARANTORS' REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that: (a) All financial statements delivered to Administrative Agent or the Lenders were or will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which are applicable to the circumstances as of the date of determination, or such other accounting principles as may be acceptable to the Requisite Lenders at the time of their preparation; (b) There has been no material adverse change in such Guarantor's financial condition since the date of the statements most recently furnished to Administrative Agent and the Lenders; and (c) All representations and warranties given on behalf of or with respect to such Guarantor contained in SECTION 5 of the Credit Agreement and in any other Loan Document or certification made in connection with the Credit Agreement are true and correct. 12. COVENANTS OF GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that it shall comply with and perform all covenants given on behalf of or with respect to such Guarantor (whether expressly or as a Subsidiary) contained in Sections 6 and 7 of the Credit Agreement and in all other Loan Documents. 13. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 14. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 15. AUTHORIZATION; NO VIOLATION. Each Guarantor is authorized to execute, deliver and perform under this Guaranty, which is a valid, binding, and enforceable obligation of such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally. The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty are not in violation of any applicable law, regulation or ordinance, or any order or ruling of any court or governmental agency applicable to such Guarantor. The Guaranty does not conflict with, or constitute a breach or default under, any agreement to which such Guarantor is a party. 16. ADDITIONAL AND INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are in addition to its obligations under any future guaranties, each of which shall remain in full force and effect until it is expressly modified or released in a writing signed by Administrative Agent and consented to by the Lenders. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are independent of those of Borrowers on the Indebtedness. Subject to Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement, Administrative Agent or the Lenders may bring a separate action, or commence a separate arbitration proceeding against each Guarantor without first proceeding against Borrowers, any other person or any security that Administrative Agent or any Lender may hold, and without pursuing any other remedy. None of Administrative Agent's or any Lender's rights under this Guaranty shall be 5
exhausted by any action by Administrative Agent or any Lender until the Indebtedness has been paid and performed in full in cash. 17. NO WAIVER; CONSENTS; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. Each waiver by Administrative Agent or the Lenders must be in writing, and no waiver shall be construed as a continuing waiver. No waiver shall be implied from Administrative Agent's or any Lender's delay in exercising or failure to exercise any right or remedy against Borrowers, any Guarantor or any security. Consent by Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any act or omission by Borrowers or any Guarantor shall not be construed as a consent to any other or subsequent act or omission, or as a waiver of the requirement for Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' consent to be obtained in any future or other instance. All remedies of Administrative Agent and each Lender against Borrowers and Guarantors are cumulative. 18. NO RELEASE. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1, no Guarantor shall be released, in whole or in part, from its obligations under this Guaranty except by a writing signed by Administrative Agent and the requisite consent of Lenders as specifically required under the Credit Agreement, if any. 19. HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS. The terms of this Guaranty shall bind and benefit the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Guarantors; provided, however, that no Guarantor may assign this Guaranty, or assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Guaranty, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent in each instance. Without notice to or the consent of Guarantors, Administrative Agent and any Lender may disclose any and all information in its possession concerning Guarantors, this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty to any actual or prospective purchaser of any securities issued or to be issued by Administrative Agent or such Lender, and to any actual or prospective purchaser or assignee of any participation or other interest in the Indebtedness and this Guaranty; provided each recipient of such information agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of SECTION 10.17 of the Credit Agreement for the benefit of the Borrowers and the Guarantors. 20. NOTICES. (a) DELIVERY. All notices, requests and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, telegraphic, telex, facsimile transmission or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed, telexed or delivered to the recipient's address specified on the signature pages hereof, or to such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party. (b) RECEIPT. All such notices and communications shall, when transmitted by overnight delivery, telegraphed, telecopied by facsimile, telexed or cabled, be effective when delivered for overnight delivery or to the telegraph company, transmitted by telecopier, confirmed by telex answerback or delivered to the cable company, respectively, or if delivered, upon delivery. (c) RELIANCE. Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any person purporting to be a person authorized by Guarantors to give such notice, and neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability to any Guarantor or any other person on account of any action taken or not taken by Administrative Agent or such Lender in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The obligation of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by Lender to receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by Administrative Agent or a Lender of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms understood by Administrative Agent or such Lender to be contained in the telephonic or facsimile notice. 21. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. In this Guaranty, the word "Borrowers" includes both the named Borrowers and any other person who at any time assumes or otherwise becomes primarily liable for all or any part of the obligations of the named Borrowers on the Indebtedness. If this Guaranty is executed by more than one person, the word "Guarantors" includes all such persons. The word "include(s)" means "include(s), without limitation," and the word "including" means "including, but not limited to." When the context and construction so require, all words used in the singular shall be deemed to have been used in the plural and vice versa. No listing of 6
specific instances, items or matters in any way limits the scope or generality of any language of this Guaranty. All headings appearing in this Guaranty are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Guaranty. 22. GOVERNING LAW. This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to its choice of law rules. 23. COSTS AND EXPENSES. If any lawsuit or arbitration is commenced which arises out of, or which relates to this Guaranty, the Loan Documents or the Indebtedness, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from each other party such sums as the court or arbitrator may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for services of in-house counsel) in the action or proceeding, in addition to costs and expenses otherwise allowed by law. In all other situations, including any Insolvency Proceeding, the Guarantors agree to pay all of the Administrative Agent's and each Lender's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for services of the Administrative Agent's and each Lender's in-house counsel) which may be incurred in any effort to collect or enforce the Indebtedness or any part of it or any term of this Guaranty. Without limiting any rights of the Administrative Agent or Lenders under the Credit Agreement and/or Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable, all amounts of any kind due and payable under this Guaranty (whether for principal, interest, and other costs under the Indebtedness, or for costs, fees, and expenses for which the Guarantors are directly responsible hereunder, or otherwise) shall accrue interest from the time the Administrative Agent or the Lenders make demand therefor hereunder until paid in full in cash to Administrative Agent or the Lenders at the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus three percentage points (3%), except to the extent that any such amounts are then accruing interest under the Indebtedness, in which case such Base Rate plus 3% interest rate shall not be applied if the effect would be to compound the interest to which such obligations are subject to under the Indebtedness. 24. COVENANT. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that it will make dividend payments on its outstanding preferred stock with its excess cash to the extent such cash is not required by such Guarantor for its business, consistent with prudent business practices and its cash requirements. 25. INTEGRATION; MODIFICATIONS. This Guaranty (a) integrates all the terms and conditions mentioned in or incidental to this Guaranty, (b) supersedes all oral negotiations and prior writings with respect to its subject matter, and (c) is intended by each Guarantor, Administrative Agent and the Lenders as the final expression of the agreement with respect to the terms and conditions set forth in this Guaranty and as the complete and exclusive statement of the terms agreed to by each Guarantor, Administrative Agent and the Lenders. No representation, understanding, promise or condition shall be enforceable against any party hereto unless it is contained in this Guaranty. This Guaranty may not be modified except in a writing signed by all of Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Lenders) and each Guarantor. No course of prior dealing, usage of trade, parol or extrinsic evidence of any nature shall be used to supplement, modify or vary any of the terms hereof. As between Administrative Agent and the Lenders only, nothing contained in this Guaranty shall alter the rights and obligations among Administrative Agent and the Lenders set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. 26. MISCELLANEOUS. The illegality or unenforceability of one or more provisions of this Guaranty shall not affect any other provision. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Guaranty by Guarantors. 27. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST GUARANTORS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY, OR ANY OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS GUARANTY, EACH GUARANTOR, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (I) ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS; (II) WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (III) AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO SUCH GUARANTOR AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 20; (IV) AGREES THAT SERVICE AS 7
PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (III) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER SUCH GUARANTOR IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT; (V) AGREES THAT ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT RETAINS THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST SUCH GUARANTOR IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION; (VI) AGREES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 27 RELATING TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE SHALL BE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 410.40 OR OTHERWISE; AND (VII) WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. 28. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GUARANTOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY.

In connection with the foregoing appointment, each Agent hereby irrevocably transfers and assigns to Collateral Agent all of such Agent's 8
rights, duties and obligations as a "Secured Party" under the Casden Borrowers Pledge Agreement and the Revolver Borrowers Pledge Agreement to take any Enforcement action with respect to the Collateral. Each Agent and Borrowers acknowledge that "Indemnified Liabilities" under Section 10.13 of each Credit Agreement includes any liability imposed on Collateral Agent as a result of the actions or failure to act of any other Party which is a predecessor "Secured Party" under the Casden Borrowers Pledge Agreement or the Revolver Borrowers Pledge Amendment prior to the Collateral Agent's performance of its duties and obligations under any the Casden Borrowers Pledge Agreement or the Revolver Borrowers Pledge Amendment, to the extent applicable, in accordance with this Agreement. B. DECISIONS RELATING TO ADMINISTRATION AND EXERCISE OF REMEDIES. (1) With respect to commencing Enforcement, Collateral Agent acknowledges and agrees that (a) an Enforcement shall only be permitted during a Standstill Period with the consent of either (x) each Agent or (y) Majority Benefited Parties, and (b) on the date after the expiration of such Standstill Period pursuant to clause (A) of the definition thereof, if no Enforcement has commenced, Collateral Agent must commence Enforcement according to the written instructions of the Enforcement Parties with respect to the Collateral, unless each Agent directs Collateral Agent to not commence such Enforcement. (2) The Collateral Agent agrees to administer each Borrowers Pledge Agreement and the Collateral and to make such demands and give such notices under the Borrowers Pledge Agreements as the Majority Benefited Parties may request in writing, provided that after the expiration of a Standstill Period pursuant to clause (A) of the definition thereof, if no Enforcement has commenced, such administration shall be pursuant to the written instructions of the Enforcement Parties, and to take such action to enforce such Borrowers Pledge Agreements and to realize upon, collect and dispose of the Collateral or any portion thereof according to the written instructions of the Enforcement Parties; PROVIDED, THAT, the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action (i) that in the Opinion of Counsel to the Collateral Agent is contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, any Borrowers Pledge Agreement or any Credit Agreement, or that would in the Opinion of Counsel to the Collateral Agent subject the Collateral Agent or any of its officers, employees, agents or directors to liability, and (ii) until the Collateral Agent shall be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by one or more of the Benefited Parties against any and all loss, cost, expense or liability in connection therewith. (3) Each Party agrees that the Collateral Agent shall act as the Majority Benefited Parties may request (regardless of whether any individual Party or Benefited Party agrees, disagrees or abstains with respect to such request), provided that after the expiration of a Standstill Period pursuant to clause (A) of the definition thereof, if no Enforcement has commenced, the Collateral Agent shall act in accordance with the written instructions of the Enforcement Parties unless all Agents agree otherwise in writing and that the Collateral Agent shall have no liability for acting in accordance with such instructions of the Enforcement Parties (provided such action does not conflict with the express terms of this Agreement or any Credit Agreement). The Collateral Agent shall give prompt notice to all Parties of action to enforce any Borrowers Pledge Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure 9
to give any such notice shall not impair the right of the Collateral Agent to take any such action or the validity or enforceability under this Agreement of the action so taken. (4) Each Party agrees that the only right of a Non-Directing Party under the Borrowers Pledge Agreements is for Benefited Obligations held by such Non-Directing Party to be secured by the Collateral for the period and to the extent provided in such Borrowers Pledge Agreements and in this Agreement and to receive their Pro Rata Share of the Proceeds of the Collateral, as provided in this Agreement. (5) The Collateral Agent may at any time request approval from all Benefited Parties as to any course of action or other matter relating hereto or to any Borrowers Pledge Agreement. Directions given by the Majority Benefited Parties, Enforcement Parties or all Agents to the Collateral Agent hereunder shall be in writing and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be binding on all Benefited Parties, including all Non-Directing Parties, for all purposes so long as such directions are lawful and do not violate any Credit Agreement. (6) Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights of any Party to give any Borrower Party notice of any default, accelerate or make demand for payment of their respective Benefited Obligations under the Credit Agreements or take any other action to collect amounts due other than an Enforcement, subject to the provisions of SECTIONS 3 and 6. Subject to SECTIONS 2B(1) and 2B(2), if the Majority Benefited Parties, Enforcement Parties or all of the Agents instruct the Collateral Agent to take any action, commence any proceedings or otherwise proceed against the Collateral or enforce any Borrowers Pledge Agreement, and such action or proceedings are or may be defective without the joinder of all Parties, then each other Party shall join in such actions or proceedings. (7) If the Collateral Agent has been notified in writing that an Event of Default has occurred, the Collateral Agent shall notify the Benefited Parties and shall notify the Borrowers of such determination. Upon receipt of a notice from a Benefited Party of the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent shall promptly give notice of such Event of Default to all Benefited Parties and the Borrowers. Collateral Agent shall (a) take such action with respect to such event as may be requested by Majority Benefited Parties; PROVIDED, that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action (i) that in the Opinion of Counsel to the Collateral Agent is contrary to law or to the terms of this Agreement, any Borrowers Pledge Agreement or any Credit Agreement, or that would in the Opinion of Counsel to the Collateral Agent subject the Collateral Agent or any of its officers, employees, agents or directors to liability, and (ii) until the Collateral Agent shall be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by one or more of the Benefited Parties against any or all loss, cost, expense or liability in connection therewith and (b) provided that after the expiration of a Standstill Period pursuant to clause (A) in the definition thereof, if no Enforcement has commenced, the Collateral Agent shall act in accordance with the Enforcement Parties' written instructions unless all Agents agree otherwise in writing). (8) No Lender shall directly or indirectly take any action, consent to the taking of any action, or cause or assist any Person to take any action, to challenge the validity, legality, perfection, priority or enforcement of any Borrowers Pledge Agreement or 10
Enforcement of the Liens of any Borrowers Pledge Agreement on the Collateral. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, no Lender shall directly or indirectly take any action, consent to the taking of any action, or cause or assist any Person to take any action, to challenge, object to, compete with or impede in any matter any act taken or proceeding commenced by another Party in connection with the Enforcement of the Benefited Obligations. No Lender nor any Agent shall take any act to foreclose on or otherwise realize upon any Collateral now or hereafter securing the Benefited Obligations, or otherwise enforce any Collateral Document, security agreement, deed of trust, mortgage, lien instrument or other encumbrance now or hereafter securing or given in connection with the Benefited Obligations, except through the Collateral Agent in accordance with this Agreement. (9) In the event there is a Payment Default under two or more Credit Agreements, each Agent agrees that if any other Agent proposes instructions of the Enforcement Parties to deliver to Collateral Agent, other than instructions agreed to by each Agent described in clause (a) of the definition of Enforcement Parties, then such proposed instructions shall promptly be submitted by such Agent to such Agent's Lender Group and the Lenders in such Lender Group shall be allowed to review and vote on such instructions. In connection with any Enforcement, each Agent acknowledges that Collateral Agent shall have the power and authority to dispose of or otherwise realize upon Collateral free and clear of any Liens of any Agent created by or through any of the Collateral Documents or other Loan Documents. (10) If any Lender or Agent attempts to violate any provision of this Agreement, Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders (in Collateral Agent's or Borrower Parties' name), may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or stop such person's actions, it being agreed that legal remedies may be inadequate. Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any impairment or nonpayment of the Benefited Obligations that results, directly or indirectly, from the exercise by Collateral Agent of any of the rights or remedies under the Loan Documents, this Agreement or under applicable law, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Collateral Agent. (11) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Borrowers Pledge Agreement or any Credit Agreement, while any of the Benefited Obligations are outstanding, the Agents on behalf of the Lenders in their Lender Group agree that from and after the date hereof, provided the Borrower Parties comply in all respects with the provisions of the Term Borrowers Pledge Agreement including, without limitation, covenants with respect to the delivery of Pledged Collateral to the extent required under any Credit Agreement, the covenants and the representations and warranties contained in the Term Borrowers Pledge Agreement, then such compliance shall be deemed to be compliance with all other Borrowers Pledge Agreements. C. APPLICATION OF MONIES AND PROCEEDS. (1) Any and all monies and Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent or a Benefited Party (net of reimbursement of the reasonable costs and expenses of collection of each Agent as provided under such Agent's Credit Agreement) in connection with a demand for payment during a Payment Default Period or an Enforcement shall be delivered to the Collateral Agent and applied and distributed promptly by the Collateral Agent as follows: 11
FIRST: To the payment of the unpaid reasonable costs and expenses, if any, of the sale, collection or other realization of the Collateral, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, and all reasonable expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith; SECOND: To each Benefited Party in the amount of its Pro Rata Share of all such Proceeds; PROVIDED, THAT, with respect to Benefited Obligations consisting of the undrawn amounts of outstanding Letters of Credit (defined in the Revolver Credit Agreement) under the Revolver Credit Agreement, payment shall be made to the Collateral Agent, to be retained as Collateral, for the ratable portion of the Benefited Obligations consisting of such undrawn amounts of outstanding Letters of Credit (provided that (i) if any such Letter of Credit is drawn upon, the Collateral Agent shall pay to the Benefited Party that issued such Letter of Credit the ratable portion of the amount of cash held as Collateral therefor pursuant to this clause which is allocable to the amount drawn upon such Letter of Credit; and (ii) if and to the extent that any such Letter of Credit shall expire or terminate, the amount of cash held as Collateral therefor pursuant to this clause shall be applied in accordance with this SECTION 2C); for purposes of determining the Pro Rata Share of all Benefited Obligations sharing in any such distribution, (i) the amount of the outstanding Revolver Indebtedness shall be deemed to be the principal amount of the Revolver Indebtedness then outstanding and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto, (ii) the amount of the outstanding Casden Indebtedness shall be deemed to be the principal amount of the Casden Indebtedness then outstanding plus all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto, and (iii) the amount of the outstanding Term Indebtedness shall be deemed to be the principal amount of the Term Indebtedness then outstanding and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto; and THIRD: After payment in full of all Benefited Obligations, to the payment to or upon the order of Borrowers, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining from monies and such Proceeds. Until such monies or Proceeds are so applied and distributed, the Collateral Agent shall hold such monies or Proceeds in its custody in accordance with its regular procedures for handling deposited funds. (2) Payments by the Collateral Agent in respect of (i) the Revolver Indebtedness shall be made to the Revolver Agent for distribution to the Revolver Lenders in accordance with the Revolver Credit Agreement; (ii) the Casden Indebtedness shall be made to the Casden Agent for distribution to the Casden Lenders in accordance with the Casden Credit Agreement; and (iii) the Term Indebtedness shall be made to the Term Agent for distribution to the Term Lenders in accordance with the Term Credit Agreement. D. NOTICE OF DEFAULT. Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any event that could give rise to an Event of Default, 12
unless Collateral Agent shall have received written notice from an Agent referring to this Agreement, describing such event and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". Collateral Agent will notify Lenders and Borrowers of its receipt of any such notice. E. CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY COLLATERAL AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that none of Collateral Agent-Related Persons (as defined in each Credit Agreement) has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Collateral Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Collateral Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter, including without limitation, whether Collateral Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender, including any Lender by assignment, represents to Collateral Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Collateral Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Collateral Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to Lenders by Collateral Agent herein, Collateral Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of any Collateral Agent-Related Persons. F. INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Collateral Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though it were not Collateral Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. Each Agent, on behalf of its respective Lenders, acknowledges that, pursuant to such activities, Collateral Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding Borrowers or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledges that Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Collateral Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Collateral Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include Collateral Agent in its individual capacity. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS. A. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any of the Loan Documents, but without derogating the provisions of SECTION 5, the first priority lien on and security interest 13
in the Collateral and Lenders' rights therein provided for in this Agreement automatically, and without any notice to, consent of, or action by any other party whatsoever, will extend to all modifications (including increases in the amount of the Loans), renewals, refinancing, replacements and extensions whatsoever of any of the Loan Documents and the Loans. Any such modification, renewal, refinancing, replacement, or extension of the Loan Documents will not affect the rights, duties and privileges of Lenders hereunder with respect to the Loan Documents, as so modified, refinanced, replaced or extended. B. No release or waiver by any Lender of any rights against any "Person" under the applicable Loan Documents will require notice to or consent of the other Lenders, or any other party, nor will any such release or waiver operate as a defense to or release of any of the obligations of the other Lenders. In furtherance of and without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 3B, all Agents on behalf of all Lenders hereby agree and consent that, without notice to or assent by any other Lender, that a Lender or Agent may exercise or refrain from exercising any right, remedy or power granted to them under the applicable Loan Documents or any other right, remedy or power at law or in equity or otherwise with respect to the applicable Indebtedness or any collateral security or lien (legal or equitable) held, given or intended to be given therefor, subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 4. PAYMENTS ON ANY INDEBTEDNESS PRIOR TO PAYMENT DEFAULT; PAYMENTS OF INTEREST BY BORROWER AFTER A PAYMENT DEFAULT; TURNOVER OF AMOUNTS TO COLLATERAL AGENT. A. So long as no Payment Default has occurred and is then continuing, Lenders will be entitled to collect from Borrowers all or any portion of the Indebtedness then outstanding by Borrowers under the applicable Loan Documents in accordance with the terms of such Loan Documents. Upon the occurrence of a Payment Default, Collateral Agent shall deliver a Requisite Notice to each Agent with a copy to the Borrowers (a "PAYMENT DEFAULT NOTICE"). During the period (the "PAYMENT DEFAULT PERIOD") commencing upon receipt of a Payment Default Notice and until the applicable Payment Default is cured by the indefeasible payment of Cash or Cash Equivalents or otherwise (if not cured by indefeasible payment of Cash or Cash Equivalents, to Collateral Agent's satisfaction in its sole and absolute discretion), each Agent and/or Lender shall deliver any and all Cash, Cash Equivalents, securities or other property received by such Agent and/or Lender on account of the Indebtedness to the Collateral Agent to be applied in accordance with SECTION 2C hereof promptly upon receipt thereof. B. Notwithstanding any provision of SECTION 4A to the contrary, interest payments received during a Payment Default Period and to which the provisions of this SECTION 4 apply, will be shared ratably by the Lender Groups with Benefited Obligations outstanding as follows: (i) If any Agent receives any interest payment (including default interest) (after deducting the amount of any reasonable costs and expenses of the Collateral Agent and any other Agent hereunder or under the Collateral Documents) to which this SECTION 4B applies during any Payment Default Period in excess of such Agent's Lender Group's Proportionate Share, such Agent shall, within two Business Days after receiving such payment, turn over to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the other Lender Groups the amount 14
of such excess interest. Any payment of interest so turned over shall not be deemed a payment of interest under the Loan Documents for the Lender Group turning over such payment. (ii) After delivery of a Payment Default Notice, any payment of interest (including default interest) made by Borrowers to any Agent shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of Borrowers certifying the Proportionate Share of each Lender Group on such date. (iii) As used in this SECTION 4B, "PROPORTIONATE SHARE" means, as of any date of determination, with respect to each Lender Group, the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (X) interest (including default interest) accrued under the Loan Documents for such Lender Group on the date the applicable interest payment was received to (Y) the aggregate amount of interest (including default interest) accrued under the Loan Documents of all Lender Groups on the date such payment was received. 5. OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF LENDERS REGARDING THE LOANS. A. None of the Lenders will amend, modify or otherwise alter their Loan Documents in any manner which materially and adversely affects (i) the other Lenders without the prior written consent of the other Lenders constituting Requisite Lenders (as defined in the applicable Credit Agreement as of the date hereof) under their respective Loan Documents, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be deemed given if not affirmatively withheld within ten Business Days after Requisite Notice thereof has been delivered to Agents for such other Lenders, provided each Agent has promptly delivered notice thereof to the applicable Lender Group. For purposes of this Agreement, a modification, amendment or alteration will "materially and adversely affect" the other Lenders if it individually, or when taken together with other modifications, amendments or alterations, (i) increases or extends the scope of the Borrowers' and/or the Guarantors' obligations under the subject Loan Documents, including, without limitation, increasing the amounts available to be borrowed thereunder, (ii) changes the maturity of any of Borrowers' obligations under the subject Loan Documents (other than an extension of the maturity as provided in SECTION 2.11 of the Casden Credit Agreement and SECTION 2.13 of the Revolver Credit Agreement) or otherwise changes, in any material respect, any other scheduled date for payments under the subject Loan Documents, (iii) makes more burdensome Borrowers' obligations under the subject Loan Documents, including, without limitation, Borrowers' obligations under any covenants contained in the subject Loan Documents, (iv) can reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of the Borrowers to perform their obligations under the respective Loan Documents or other Lenders' Loan Documents or (v) in any way changes the provisions of such Credit Agreement relating to the appointment, removal or replacement of the Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any amendment, modification or other alteration of any Loan Document is approved by Lenders under the Credit Agreement to be amended, modified or altered in accordance with the terms of the applicable Credit Agreement in effect on the date hereof (or as amended pursuant hereto), and a substantially equivalent amendment, modification or other alteration to the other Lenders' Loan Documents is concurrently approved by the applicable Lenders in accordance with the terms of such other Credit Agreements in effect on the date hereof, then no consent of the other Lenders, shall be required with respect to such amendment, modification or alteration of the Lenders' Loan Documents. It is agreed and understood that (A) 15
an amendment of the percentages set forth in SECTION 2.03(c)(ii) of the Casden Credit Agreement will not be a material amendment hereunder, (B) delivery of updated schedules, guaranties or other information or documents by Borrowers, as contemplated under the Credit Agreements as of the date hereof and (C) reductions in the Commitments (as defined in the Revolver Credit Agreements) provided for in Section 2.07 of the Revolver Credit Agreement as of the date hereof, and/or the Borrowers' exercise of its option to increase the Revolver Commitments under Section 2.01 of the Revolver Credit Agreement are not deemed to be an amendment, modification or other alteration under this SECTION 5A . B. Lenders will not be entitled to record or file any mortgage, deed of trust, financing statement or any other lien or encumbrance against Borrowers, or any real property or other property now or hereafter owned by Borrowers and/or their respective Affiliates with respect to the Collateral; PROVIDED, however, if any Agent reasonably believes that any mortgage, deed of trust, financing statement or any other lien or encumbrance against Borrowers, or any real property or other property now or hereafter owned by Borrowers and/or their respective Affiliates with respect to the Collateral is not properly filed or recorded then after giving Collateral Agent reasonable time in which to so file or record (not to exceed 5 Business Days), such Agent shall be entitled to file or record such document or instrument, on behalf of and in the name of the Collateral Agent. C. Lenders will not be entitled to sell, assign or otherwise transfer their respective Loans or Loan Documents without causing such assignee to acknowledge that such Loan Documents and assignee's rights as a Lender are subject to the provisions hereof. D. Each Agent will deliver to the other Agents, concurrently with delivery of the same to Borrowers, a copy of each notice delivered to each Borrower under its Loan Documents. E. Each Agent, within five Business Days after request by another Agent, will verify, in writing, the status of and payments made under such Agent's Loan Documents. F. If at any time after the date of this Agreement: (i) any Agent (a "NOTIFYING AGENT") delivers to any Borrower Party a written notice that there has occurred a "Default" or "Event of Default" under such Agent's Loan Documents (an "AGENT DEFAULT NOTICE"), then the Notifying Agent shall provide a copy of the Agent Default Notice to the other Agents within two Business Days thereafter; or (ii) if an Agent (a "RECEIVING AGENT") receives written notice from any Borrower Party stating that there has occurred a "Default" or "Event of Default" under the applicable Loan Documents (the "BORROWER DEFAULT NOTICE"), then such Receiving Agent must provide a copy of the Borrower Default Notice to the other Agents within two Business Days thereafter. 6. BANKRUPTCY AND CERTAIN WAIVERS WITH RESPECT TO LENDERS. A. Each Lender acknowledges that all other Lenders have made material and substantial concessions by entering into their respective Loan Documents and have relied upon the agreement of each Lender not to seek modifications of this Agreement or the Loan Documents by resorting to or relying upon any provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other remedy whatsoever, and furthermore, but for the agreement of each Lender made herein not to resort to any provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or other 16
remedy to modify the form and substance of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, the other Lenders would not have entered into their respective Loan Documents. B. In the event of any Proceeding involving any Borrowers, each Lender shall retain the right to vote, file a proof of claim and otherwise act with respect to their Indebtedness (including the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of partial or complete liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, composition, or extension), provided that such Lender or its Affiliates shall not take any such action which is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or actions taken by Collateral Agent, and shall not initiate or prosecute any claim or action in such Proceeding challenging this Agreement, or actions taken or not taken by Collateral Agent consistent with or as provided in this Agreement, and shall not oppose or otherwise defend against actions by Collateral Agent in such Proceeding, including without limitation seeking relief from automatic stay or similar injunction. C. To the extent permitted by law, each Lender hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of and to cause their Affiliates not to assert or take advantage of in each case (as a defense or otherwise) as against Collateral Agent: (i) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, death or disability of any other person or persons or the failure of Collateral Agent or any Lender to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any other Proceeding) of any other person or persons other than a failure to file or enforce a proof of claim against the estate of the Borrowers or in any Proceeding in respect of the Borrowers; (ii) any failure on the part of Collateral Agent, or any Lender to ascertain the liability of any party liable for the Loan Documents or the obligations evidenced or secured thereby; (iii) demand, presentment for payments, notice of nonpayment, protest, notice of protest and all other notices of any kind, or the lack of any thereof, including notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional indebtedness or obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of Collateral Agent, any Lenders, any endorser or creditor of Borrowers or Lenders or on the part of any other person whomsoever under this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of indebtedness secured by Collateral held by Collateral Agent; (iv) any right or claim or right to cause a marshalling of the assets of any Borrower or Lender which is inconsistent with any Borrowers Pledge Agreement; (v) any principle or provision of law, statutory or otherwise, which is or might be in conflict with the terms and provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents; (vi) any duty on the part of Collateral Agent, any Agent or any Lender to disclose to any other Agent or Lender any facts Collateral Agent, or such Agent or Lender may now or hereafter know about Borrowers, regardless of whether Collateral Agent, any Agent or any Lender has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the risk beyond that 17
which any other Lender intends to assume or have reason to believe that such facts are unknown to such Lender or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to such Lender, it being understood and agreed that each Lender is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial condition of Borrowers and of any and all circumstances bearing on the risk that liability may be incurred by such Lender hereunder or under the Loan Documents; (vii) failure to properly record any document, failure to secure Borrowers' obligations under the Loan Documents, or any other lack of due diligence by Collateral Agent, any Agent or any Lender in obtaining reimbursement or performance from any person or entity now or hereafter liable for any of the Loan Documents; (viii) the inaccuracy of any representation or other provision contained herein or in any of the Loan Documents; (ix) any sale or assignment of any of the Loan Documents, in whole or in part, except to the extent that such sale or assignment results in a transfer of the rights sold or assigned; (x) any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability, in whole or in part, of this Agreement or any one or more of the Loan Documents; (xi) any lack of commercial reasonableness in dealing with any Loan or the Collateral; (xii) any assertion or claim that the automatic stay provided by 11 U.S.C. Section 362 (or any successor thereto) (arising upon the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding of any Lender or Borrower) or any other stay provided under any other debtor relief law (whether statutory, common law, case law or otherwise) of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect, which may be or - become applicable, will operate or be interpreted to stay, interdict, condition, reduce or inhibit the ability of Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of Majority Benefited Parties) or any Lender to enforce any rights, whether now or hereafter acquired, which Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of Majority Benefitted Parties) or Term any Lender may have against any other Lender; (xiii) any modifications of any Loan Document or any obligations of any Lender or relating to the Loan Documents by operation of law or by action of any court, whether pursuant to Bankruptcy Code or any other debtor relief law (whether statutory, common law, case law or otherwise) of any jurisdiction whatsoever, now or hereafter in effect, or otherwise; (xiv) any change in the composition of Revolver Lenders, Casden Lenders, Term Lenders, Revolver Borrowers, Casden Borrowers or Term Borrowers; (xv) granting of compromises and indulgences with respect to the Collateral Documents, as authorized herein and the Credit Agreements; (xvi) release of any Pledgor or Collateral as authorized herein and in the Credit Agreements; and 18

D. Upon the occurrence of any Proceeding, any payment or distribution of any kind (whether in Cash, Cash Equivalents, securities or other property) which otherwise would be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the Benefited Obligations owed to a Lender, will be paid or delivered directly to Collateral Agent for application to (in the case of Cash or Cash Equivalents) or as Collateral for the payment of the Benefited Obligations in accordance with SECTION 2C. E. In any Proceeding, Collateral Agent may, and is hereby irrevocably authorized and empowered (in its own name or in the name of each Lender), but will have no obligation (unless directed pursuant to this Agreement), to demand, sue for, collect and receive every payment or distribution referred to in Section 6 above and give acquittance therefor. F. Upon the occurrence of any Proceeding, the provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and irrespective of the terms of any plan of reorganization or order in such Proceeding shall apply with full force and effect.

If a Repayment Event occurs which results in the Collateral Agent being required to return or repay any amount distributed by it under this Agreement, the Benefited Party to which such amount was distributed shall, promptly upon its receipt of a notice thereof from the Collateral Agent, pay the Collateral Agent such amount; PROVIDED, THAT if any Benefited Party shall fail to promptly pay such amount to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent may deduct such amount from any amounts payable thereafter to such Benefited Party under this Agreement. 8.

Such Conversion shall be effective upon the last day of the applicable Interest Period and after notice has been given to Borrowers and shall continue so long as such Default or Event of Default continues to exist. (e) If a Loan is to be made on the same date that another Loan is due and payable, Borrowers or Lenders, as the case may be, shall make available to Administrative Agent the net amount of funds giving effect to both such Loans and the effect for purposes of this Agreement shall be the same as if separate transfers of funds had been made with respect to each such Loan. (f) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan on any date shall not relieve any other Lender of any obligation to make a Loan on such date, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan. 45

Such loan accounts, records or Swing Line Note shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of such Swing Line Loans and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrowers to pay any amount owing with respect to the Swing Line Loans. 2.04 BORROWINGS OF SWING LINE LOANS. (a) Borrowers may irrevocably request a Borrowing of Swing Line Loans in a Minimum Amount therefor by delivering a Request for Extension of Credit therefor by Requisite Notice to Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender not later than the Requisite Time therefor.

Within two (2) Business Days after each Swing Line Loan is funded, Swing Line Lender and Administrative Agent shall request that each Lender, and each Lender shall, at the Requisite Time after such request is made, prepay one or more Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Swing Line Loans by funding under such Lender's Commitment, such purchase to be made in accordance with the terms of SECTION 2.01 of this Agreement just as if such Lender 46
were funding a Base Rate Loan directly to Borrowers under its Commitment (such that all Lenders other than Swing Line Lender shall fund only under their respective Commitments). Unless Administrative Agent had actual knowledge when Swing Line Lender funded a Swing Line Loan that Borrowers have not satisfied the conditions in this Agreement to obtain a borrowing, each Lender's obligation to prepay the Swing Line Loans shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense, or other right which such Lender or any other Person may have against Swing Line Lender or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default or the termination of any Lender's Commitment, (iii) the occurrence of any Material Adverse Effect, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by Borrowers, any Borrower Party, Administrative Agent, or any other Lender, or (v) any other circumstance, happening, or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. Any portion of a Swing Line Loan not so prepaid may be treated by Swing Line Lender as a Loan which was not funded by the non-purchasing Lenders as contemplated in SECTION 2.11(d) of this Agreement, and as a funding by Swing Line Lender under the Combined Commitments in excess of Swing Line Lender's Commitment. Each Swing Line Loan, once so prepaid, shall cease to be a Swing Line Loan for the purposes of this Agreement, but shall be deemed a borrowing made under the Combined Commitments and each Lender's Commitment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that so long as Bank of America is both Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender, no Lender shall be obligated to prepay any Swing Line Loan for which Borrowers have not satisfied the applicable conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 4 hereof. 2.05 LETTERS OF CREDIT.

Unless Administrative Agent notifies Issuing Lender that such Letter of Credit Action is not permitted hereunder or Issuing Lender determines that such 47
Letter of Credit Action is contrary to any Laws or policies of Issuing Lender or does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this Agreement, Issuing Lender shall effect such Letter of Credit Action. This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict with any Letter of Credit Application. Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased a pro rata participation in such Letter of Credit from Issuing Lender in an amount equal to that Lender's Pro Rata Share. (c) REIMBURSEMENT OF PAYMENTS UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT.

Each Lender shall make funds in an amount equal its Pro Rata Share of such amount available to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office not later than the Requisite Time on the Business Day specified by Administrative Agent. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse Issuing Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing Lender for the amount of any payment made by Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. (e) NATURE OF LENDERS' FUNDING. If the conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 4 can be satisfied (except for the giving of a Request for Extension of Credit) on the date Borrowers are obligated to make, but fail to make, a reimbursement of a payment under a Letter of Credit, the funding by Lenders pursuant to subsection (d) above shall be deemed to be part of a Borrowing of Committed Loans which are Base Rate Loans (without regard to the Minimum Amount therefor) requested by Borrowers. If the conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 4 cannot be satisfied on the date Borrowers are obligated to make, but fail to make, a reimbursement of a payment under a Letter of Credit, the funding by Lenders pursuant to subsection (d) above shall be deemed to be a funding by each Lender of its participation in such Letter of Credit, and such funds shall be payable by Borrowers upon demand and shall bear interest at the Default Rate, and each Lender making such funding shall thereupon acquire a pro rata participation, to the extent of such reimbursement, in the claim of Issuing Lender against Borrowers in respect of such payment and shall share, in accordance with that pro rata participation, in any payment made by Borrowers with respect to such claim.

In addition, Borrowers will promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and amendments thereto delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrowers' instructions or other irregularity, Borrowers will immediately notify Issuing Lender in writing.

Each Lender and Borrower Party agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, Issuing Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft and certificates expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. No Administrative Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of Lenders or the Requisite Lenders, as applicable; any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit. Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrowers' pursuing such rights and remedies as they may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. No Administrative Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of Issuing Lender, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in subsection (g) above. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Lender may 50
accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. (i) APPLICABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL STANDBY PRACTICES 1998. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Issuing Lender and Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" or such later revision as may be published by the Institute of International Banking Law and Practice, subject to applicable Laws, shall be deemed a part of this Section and shall apply to such Letter of Credit. (j) FEES AND OTHER CHARGES. Borrowers agree to pay the following amounts with respect to Letters of Credit issued hereunder: (i) with respect to each Letter of Credit, a letter of credit fee, payable to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders, equal to the Applicable Margin for Offshore Rate Loans, stated as a percentage per annum, of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, each such letter of credit fee to be payable in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year and computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed; and (ii) with respect to the issuance, amendment or transfer of each Letter of Credit and each payment of a drawing made thereunder (without duplication of the fees payable under clause (a) above), documentary and processing charges payable directly to the applicable Issuing Lender for its own account in accordance with such Issuing Lender's standard schedule for such charges in effect at the time of such issuance, amendment, transfer or payment, as the case may be. For purposes of calculating any fees payable under clause (i) of this SECTION 2.05(j), the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit shall be determined as of the close of business on any date of determination. Promptly upon receipt by Administrative Agent of any amount described in clause (i) of this SECTION 2.05(j), Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share of such amount. (k) EXISTING LETTERS OF CREDIT. Each Existing Letter of Credit outstanding on the Initial Closing Date shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit hereunder and all unpaid reimbursement obligations owed in respect of amounts drawn on Existing Letters of Credit shall be reimbursement obligations hereunder. 2.06 PREPAYMENTS; MANDATORY AMORTIZATION. (a) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. Upon Requisite Notice to Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor, Borrowers may at any time and from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans and/or Swing Line Loans in part in at least the Minimum 51
Amount therefor or in full without premium or penalty. Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof and of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. Any prepayment of an Offshore Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with the costs set forth in SECTION 3.05. (b) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. (i) Free Corporate Cash Flow. If at any time the Outstanding Obligations exceed the lesser of (x) the Combined Commitments then in effect and (y) an amount equal to 300% of the Free Corporate Cash Flow for the four fiscal quarter period most recently ended on or before such time of determination, then Borrowers shall immediately prepay Loans in an amount sufficient to reduce the Outstanding Obligations to the lesser of (x) the Combined Commitments then in effect and (y) an amount equal to 300% of the Free Corporate Cash Flow for the four fiscal quarter period most recently ended on or before such time of determination. (ii) Other Limitations on Combined Commitments. If for any reason the Outstanding Obligations exceed the Outstanding Obligations as reduced by this Section or because of any limitation set forth in this Agreement or otherwise, Borrowers shall immediately prepay Loans and/or deposit Cash in a Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account in an aggregate amount equal to such excess. (iii) Net Issuance Proceeds. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, no later than the fourth Business Day after the date of receipt by the Borrowers, the Guarantors or any of their Subsidiaries of Net Issuance Proceeds (except any such Net Issuance Proceeds received from the sale of Stock or Partnership Units in Park La Brea) after the Amendment Effective Date, Borrowers shall prepay the Loans and pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Issuance Proceeds. (iv) Net Disposition Proceeds.

(c) APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS. (i) Unless otherwise instructed by Borrowers, any prepayments pursuant to SECTION 2.06(a) or SECTION 2.06(b) made (1) on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for any Loan shall be applied first to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to any Offshore Rate Loans then outstanding, in the forward order of such Offshore Rate Loans' stated maturities and (2) on the last day of an Interest Period for any Offshore Rate Loan shall be applied first to such maturing Offshore Rate Loan, then to any Base Rate Loans outstanding, and then to any other Offshore Rate Loans then outstanding, in the forward order of such Offshore Rate Loans' stated maturities. (ii) In the event that Borrowers make any extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to SECTION 2.13, then any prepayments pursuant to SECTION 2.06(a) or SECTION 2.06(b) shall be applied to reduce the scheduled installments of principal of the Loans set forth in SECTION 2.06(d) in inverse order of maturity. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the occurrence of a Payment Default (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and during the continuation thereof, each payment received pursuant to this SECTION 2.06 shall be applied in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. (d) SCHEDULED REPAYMENTS. In the event that Borrowers make the extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to SECTION 2.13, Borrowers shall make principal payments on the Outstanding Obligations on each of the following dates in the aggregate amount, expressed as a percentage of the Lenders' aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Obligations outstanding as of the Extension Effective Date (as defined in SECTION 2.13(b)), set forth opposite such date in the table set forth below: 53
; PROVIDED that the Outstanding Obligations and other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Loans shall be paid in full no later than the Maturity Date and the final installment payable by Borrowers in respect of the Loans on such date shall be in an amount sufficient to repay all amounts owing by Borrowers under this Agreement with respect to the Loans. (e) Notwithstanding the contrary provisions of this Subsection 2.06, the Borrowers may, in lieu of prepaying the Loans and paying accrued and unpaid interest thereon per Subsections 2.06(b) (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) hereof, retain any Net Disposition Proceeds, Net Issuance Proceeds, Net Refinancing Proceeds or Net Indebtedness Proceeds, as applicable, upon receipt by the Borrowers, Guarantors or any of their Subsidiaries; PROVIDED, THAT, the Borrowers submit a certificate to Administrative Agent in the form of Exhibit N attached hereto certifying, among other things, that the Borrowers are in compliance with all of the covenants in this Agreement, and that there does not exist any Default or Event of Default immediately before and after the receipt of such proceeds. 2.07 REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS. Upon Requisite Notice to Administrative Agent not later than the Requisite Time therefor, Borrowers may at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty, permanently and irrevocably reduce the Commitments in at least the Minimum Amount therefor to an amount not less than the Outstanding Obligations at such time or terminate the Commitments. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Lenders of any such request for reduction or termination of the Commitments. Each Lender's Commitment shall be reduced by an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share TIMES the amount of such reduction. 2.08 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST; DEFAULT RATE. (a) If not sooner paid (including repayments pursuant to SECTION 2.06), Borrowers agree to pay the outstanding principal amount of each Loan on the Maturity Date. 54
(b) Subject to subsection (c) below, Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Loan (before, during and after a Default or an Event of Default, before and after maturity, before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws) from the date borrowed until paid in full (whether by acceleration or otherwise) on each applicable Interest Payment Date at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate determined in accordance with the definition of such type of Loan, PLUS the Applicable Margin. (c) If any amount payable by any Borrower Party under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), it shall thereafter bear interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including, without limitation, interest on past due interest) shall be payable upon demand. 2.09 FEES. (a) FACILITY FEE. On a quarterly basis, payable in advance on the first Business Day of each fiscal quarter, Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender pro-rata according to its Pro-Rata Share, a facility fee equal to 0.200% per annum times the Combined Commitments as in effect when such payment is due. No facility fee shall accrue on or after any extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to SECTION 2.13. All facility fees are fully earned on the date paid. The facility fee paid to each Lender hereunder and under the Original Agreement is solely for its own account and is nonrefundable for any reason. (b) AGENCY FEES. Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent an agency fee in such amounts and at such times as agreed upon by letter agreement between Borrowers and Administrative Agent and in the event of any extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to SECTION 2.13, Borrowers shall continue to pay such agency fee to Administrative Agent in accordance with such letter agreement. The agency fee is for the services to be performed by Administrative Agent in acting as Administrative Agent and is fully earned on the date paid. The agency fee paid to Administrative Agent is solely for its own account and is nonrefundable. (c) [OMITTED] (d) EXTENSION FEE. If the Maturity Date shall be extended in accordance with SECTION 2.13, Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent the fees specified in SECTION 2.13(d). (e) MODIFICATION FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent a modification fee when and as designated in any fee letter by and between Borrowers and Administrative Agent. 2.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. Computation of all types of interest and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to Lenders than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall accrue on each Loan 55
for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, PROVIDED that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. 2.11 MAKING PAYMENTS. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all payments by Borrowers or any Lender shall be made to Administrative Agent at Administrative Agent's Office not later than the Requisite Time for such type of payment. All payments received after such Requisite Time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day. All payments shall be made in immediately available funds in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments by Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. (b) Upon satisfaction of any applicable terms and conditions set forth herein, Administrative Agent shall promptly make any amounts received in accordance with the prior subsection available in like funds received as follows: (i) if payable to Borrowers, by crediting the Designated Deposit Account, and (ii) if payable to any Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender at the address specified in SCHEDULE 10.02, as amended from time to time by such Lender. (c) Subject to the definition of "INTEREST PERIOD," if any payment to be made by any Borrower Party shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding Business Day. (d) Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 2.05(c) with respect to Borrowers reimbursing drawings under Letters of Credit, unless a Borrower or any Lender has notified Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment to be made by it is due, that it does not intend to remit such payment, Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, assume that Borrowers or Lender, as the case may be, have timely remitted such payment and may, in its discretion and in reliance thereon, make available such payment to the Person entitled thereto. If such payment was not in fact remitted to Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then: (i) if Borrowers failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to Administrative Agent the amount of such assumed payment made available to such Lender, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to Administrative Agent at the Federal Funds Rate; and (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent promptly shall notify Borrowers, and Borrowers shall pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to recover 56
from such Lender interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by Administrative Agent to Borrowers to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the daily Federal Funds Rate. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which Administrative Agent or Borrowers may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. 2.12 FUNDING SOURCES. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 2.13 EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE. (a) Not earlier than ninety (90) days prior to, nor later than sixty (60) days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect, Borrowers may request by Requisite Notice made to Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify Lenders) a one-time one year extension of the Maturity Date. Such request shall include a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer stating that (i) the representations and warranties contained in SECTION 5 are true and correct on and as of the date of such certificate and (ii) no Default or Event of Default exists. (b) If the statements in such certificate are true and correct, the Maturity Date shall be extended to the same date in the following calendar year, effective as of a date to be determined by Administrative Agent and Borrowers (the "EXTENSION EFFECTIVE DATE"), and Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Lenders thereof. On or prior to the Extension Effective Date, Borrowers shall deliver to Administrative Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent: (i) corporate resolutions and incumbency certificates of Borrowers dated as of the Extension Effective Date approving such extension, (ii) new or amended Notes, if requested by any new or affected Lender, evidencing such new or extended Commitments, and (iii) an acknowledgement and consent from each Guarantor affirming the effectiveness of its Guaranty after giving effect to the Maturity Date, as extended hereunder. (c) Only one extension of the Maturity Date may be made, and the Maturity Date shall not, in any event, be extended beyond July 31, 2006. (d) Borrowers shall pay to Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender pro-rata according to its Pro Rata Share, an extension fee equal to 0.25% times the Outstanding Obligations on the first day of the new extension period. The extension fee shall be payable on the first day of the new extension period and such extension fees are fully earned on the date paid. The extension fee paid to each Lender is solely for its own account and is nonrefundable. 57
(e) This section shall supercede any provisions in SECTION 10.01 to the contrary. 2.14 COLLATERAL The payment and performance of the Obligations are and shall be secured by the Pledged Collateral subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Borrowers Pledge Agreement. SECTION 3. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 3.01 TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by Borrowers to or for the account of Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, EXCLUDING, in the case of Administrative Agent and any Lender, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the Laws of which Administrative Agent or such Lender is organized, maintains a Lending Office or otherwise does business, or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as a "TAX" or "TAXES"). If Borrowers shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to Administrative Agent or any Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), each of the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made (such increase, an "ADDITIONAL AMOUNT"); (ii) Borrowers shall make such deductions, (iii) Borrowers shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) Borrowers shall furnish to Administrative Agent (who shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (b) In addition, Borrowers agree to pay any and all present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES"). (c) Borrowers agree to indemnify Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by Administrative Agent and such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted unless and except to the extent such Taxes or Other Taxes were 58
imposed solely as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be. (d) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "FOREIGN LENDER") agrees that: (i) such Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN ("Form W-8BEN") or any successor thereto (relating to such Person and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI ("Form W-8ECI") or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent that such Person is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Person shall (A) promptly submit to the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Person by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrowers make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Person. If such Person fails to deliver the above forms or other documentation, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Person an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code, without reduction. (ii) such Lender shall, before or promptly after the occurrence of any event (including the passing of time but excluding any event mentioned in (i) above) requiring a change in or renewal of the most recent Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI previously delivered by such Lender, deliver to Borrowers through Administrative Agent two (2) accurate and complete original signed copies of Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, as appropriate, in replacement of the forms previously delivered by such Lender; and (iii) such Lender shall, promptly upon Borrowers' reasonable request to that effect, deliver to Borrowers such other forms or similar documentation as 59
may be required from time to time by any applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation in order to establish such Lender's tax status for withholding purposes. (e) Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Additional Amounts in respect of United States Federal or state income tax pursuant to this Section 3.01 to any Lender or any duly appointed assignee for the account of any Lending Office of such Lender or assignee: (i) if the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts arises as a result of a failure by such Lender or assignee to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 in respect of such Lending Office; (ii) if such Lender or assignee shall have delivered to Borrowers a Form W-8BEN in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to this Section 3.01, and such Lender or assignee shall not at any time be entitled to exemption from deduction or withholding of United States Federal income tax in respect of payments by Borrowers hereunder for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8BEN; or (iii) if such Lender or assignee shall have delivered to Borrowers a Form W-8ECI in respect of such Lending Office pursuant to this Section 3.01, and such Lender or assignee shall not at any time be entitled to reduction, partial exemption or exemption from deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax in respect of payments by Borrowers hereunder for the account of such Lending Office for any reason other than a change in United States law or regulations or any applicable tax treaty or regulations or in the official interpretation of such law, treaty or regulations by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of delivery of such Form W-8ECI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an assignee subject to U.S. withholding taxes shall be entitled to receive Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 3.01(a) to the same extent that such assignee's assignor was entitled to receive such Additional Amounts. (f) If, at any time, Borrowers request any Lender to deliver any forms or other documentation pursuant to this Section 3.01, then Borrowers shall, on demand of such Lender, through Administrative Agent reimburse such Lender for any costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) reasonably incurred by such Lender in the preparation or delivery of such forms or other documentation. (g) If Borrowers are required to pay Additional Amounts to Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.01, then such Lender shall use its reasonable best efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending 60
Office so as to eliminate any such additional payment by Borrowers which may thereafter accrue if such change in the judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Laws have made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Offshore Rate Loans, or materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable offshore Dollar market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Offshore Rate, then, on notice thereof by Lender to Borrowers through Administrative Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make Offshore Rate Loans shall be suspended until Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay or Convert all Offshore Rate Loans of that Lender, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Offshore Rate Loans. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. 3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If, in connection with any Extension of Credit involving any Offshore Rate Loan, Administrative Agent determines that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore Dollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of the requested Offshore Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the underlying interest rate for such Offshore Rate Loan, or (c) such underlying interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lender of funding such Offshore Rate Loan, Administrative Agent will promptly notify Borrowers and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of all Lenders to make or maintain such Offshore Rate Loan shall be suspended until Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of Offshore Rate Loans or, failing that, be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. 3.04 INCREASED COST AND REDUCED RETURN; CAPITAL ADEQUACY. (a) If any Lender determines that any Laws: (i) subject such Lender to any Tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Offshore Rate Loans or its obligation to make Offshore Rate Loans, or change the basis on which Taxes are imposed on any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement in respect of any Offshore Rate Loans; (ii) shall impose or modify any reserve, special deposit, or similar requirement (other than the reserve requirement utilized in the determination of 61
the Offshore Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (including its Commitment); or (iii) shall impose on such Lender or on the offshore Dollar interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, Converting into, Continuing, or maintaining any Offshore Rate Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement with respect to any Offshore Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such demand to Administrative Agent), Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If any Lender determines that any change in or the interpretation of any Laws have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. 3.05 BREAKFUNDING COSTS. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: (a) any Continuation, Conversion, payment or prepayment of any Offshore Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or (b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, Continue or Convert any Offshore Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by such Borrower; including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Offshore Rate Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. 3.06 MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION. A certificate of Administrative Agent claiming compensation under this SECTION 3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of clearly demonstrable error. In determining such amount, Administrative Agent 62
may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. For purposes of this SECTION 3, a Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Offshore Rate Loan at the Offshore Base Rate used in determining the Offshore Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore Dollar interbank market, whether or not such Offshore Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 3.07 SURVIVAL. All of Borrowers' obligations under this SECTION 3 shall survive termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations. SECTION 4.

Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or Lenders provided for elsewhere in this Agreement, or the other Loan Documents, or by applicable Law, or in equity, or otherwise: (a) upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default OTHER THAN an Event of Default described in SECTION 8.01(j): (i) Supermajority Lenders may request Administrative Agent to, and Administrative Agent thereupon shall, terminate the Commitments and/or declare all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the same shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without protest, presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers; and (ii) Issuing Lender may, with the approval of Administrative Agent on behalf of Supermajority Lenders, demand immediate payment by Borrowers of an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit Usage to be held in a Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account. (iii) While all or any portion of the Casden Loan is outstanding and there are Lenders which constitute Group B Lenders, if within 30 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Subsections 8.01(a), (b), (f), (h), (j) and (u), Supermajority Lenders have not requested that Administrative Agent terminate the Commitments and/or declare all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, then unless Group A Lenders holding in the aggregate more than 51% of the combined Commitments of Group A Lenders then in effect and Group B Lenders holding in the aggregate 99
more than 51% of the combined Commitments of Group B Lenders then in effect direct otherwise, Administrative Agent shall take such action as if directed by the Supermajority Lenders pursuant to SUBSECTION 8.02(a)(i); and (iv) While all or any portion of the Casden Loan is outstanding and there are Lenders which constitute Group B Lenders, if within 90 days after the occurrence of an Event of Default described in SUBSECTIONS 8.01(c), (e), (g), (i), (k), (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s) OR (t), Supermajority Lenders have not requested that Administrative Agent terminate the Commitments and/or declare all or any part of the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, then unless Group A Lenders holding in the aggregate more than 51% of the combined Commitments of Group A Lenders then in effect and Group B Lenders holding in the aggregate more than 51% of the combined Commitments of Group B Lenders then in effect direct otherwise, Administrative Agent shall take such action as if directed by the Supermajority Lenders pursuant to SUBSECTION 8.02(a)(i). (b) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in SECTION 8.01(j): (i) the Commitments and all other obligations of Administrative Agent or Lenders to Borrowers (other than the confidentiality provisions of SECTION 10.17, and the Lenders' agreement to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office, as provided in SECTION 3.01(G), and to designate a different Lending Office, as provided in SECTION 3.02) shall automatically terminate without notice to or demand upon Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers; (ii) the unpaid principal of all Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents shall be forthwith due and payable, without protest, presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrowers; and (iii) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit Usage shall be immediately due and payable to Issuing Lender without notice to or demand upon Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers, to be held in a Letter of Credit Cash Collateral Account. (c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lenders and Administrative Agent, or any of them, without notice to (except as expressly provided for in any Loan Document) or demand upon Borrowers, which are expressly waived by Borrowers (except as to notices expressly provided for in any Loan Document), may proceed to (but only with the consent of Supermajority Lenders) protect, exercise and enforce their rights and remedies under the Loan Documents against any Borrower Party and such other rights and remedies as are provided by Law or equity. 100
(d) Except as permitted by SECTION 10.05, no Lender may exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Obligations without the consent of Supermajority Lenders in their sole discretion. The order and manner in which Administrative Agent's and Lenders' rights and remedies are to be exercised shall be determined by Supermajority Lenders in their sole discretion. Regardless of how a Lender may treat payments for the purpose of its own accounting, for the purpose of computing the Obligations hereunder, payments shall be applied FIRST, to costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Administrative Agent and each Lender, SECOND, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Loans to and including the date of such application, THIRD, to the payment of the unpaid principal of the Loans, and FOURTH, to the payment of all other amounts (including fees) then owing to Administrative Agent and Lenders under the Loan Documents, in each case paid pro rata to Administrative Agent and each Lender in the same proportions that the aggregate Obligations owed to Administrative Agent and each Lender under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed under the Loan Documents to Administrative Agent and all Lenders, without priority or preference among Administrative Agent and Lenders. No application of payments will cure any Event of Default, or prevent acceleration, or continued acceleration, of amounts payable under the Loan Documents, or prevent the exercise, or continued exercise, of rights or remedies of Administrative Agent and Lenders hereunder or thereunder or at Law or in equity. SECTION 9. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT 9.01 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to SECTION 9.09) appoints, designates and authorizes Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with reference to Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. (b) Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith until such time and except for so long as Administrative Agent may agree at the request of the Requisite Lenders to act for such Issuing Lender with respect thereto; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to Administrative Agent in this SECTION 9 with respect to 101
any acts taken or omissions suffered by Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the application and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in this SECTION 9 included Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to Issuing Lender. 9.02 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. 9.03 LIABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. None of Administrative Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrowers, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of Borrowers or any other party to any Loan Document to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Administrative Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of Borrowers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 9.04 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. (a) Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless such Note shall have been transferred in accordance with Section 10.04 and all actions required by such Section in connection with such transfer shall have been taken. Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Requisite Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by 102
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders, if required hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of Lenders. (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in SECTION 4.01, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by Administrative Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to such Lender. 9.05 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Administrative Agent for the account of Lenders, unless Administrative Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or Borrowers referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". Administrative Agent will notify Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with SECTION 8; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that unless and until Administrative Agent has received any such request, Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of Lenders. 9.06 CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Each Lender acknowledges that none of Administrative Agent-Related Persons or Co-Lead Arrangers has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Administrative Agent-Related Person or any Co-Lead Arranger to any Lender as to any matter, including without limitation, whether Administrative Agent-Related Persons or Co-Lead Arrangers, as the case may be, have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender, including any Lender by assignment, represents to Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person or any Co-Lead Arranger and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently 103
and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent-Related Person or any Co-Lead Arranger and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to Lenders by Administrative Agent herein, Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of Borrowers or any of their Subsidiaries which may come into the possession of any of Administrative Agent-Related Persons or Co-Lead Arranger. 9.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Administrative Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Administrative Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Administrative Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Administrative Agent after the Initial Closing Date in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrowers. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Administrative Agent. 9.08 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with Borrowers and their Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though it were not Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender hereunder and without notice to or consent of Lenders. Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding Borrowers or their Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any 104
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. 9.09 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Supermajority Lenders shall, resign as Administrative Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lenders. If Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Requisite Lenders shall appoint from among Lenders a successor administrative agent for Lenders, and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such successor administrative agent shall require the approval of Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If no successor administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent may appoint, after consulting with Lenders and Borrowers, a successor administrative agent from among Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the term "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT" shall mean such successor administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this SECTION 9 and SECTIONS 10.03 and 10.13 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Requisite Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Bank of America may not be removed as Administrative Agent at the request of Supermajority Lenders unless Bank of America shall also simultaneously be replaced as "Issuing Lender" hereunder pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America. 9.10 CO-LEAD AGENTS. None of Lenders identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a "lead agent" or "co-lead agent" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of Lenders so identified as a "lead agent" or "co-lead agent" shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. 105
SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS 10.01 AMENDMENTS; CONSENTS. No amendment, modification, supplement, extension, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no approval or consent thereunder, and no consent to any departure by any Borrower Party therefrom shall be effective unless in writing signed by Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) without the approval in writing of Administrative Agent and Supermajority Lenders, no amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent may be effective to amend the provisions of SECTION 7.14 while all or any portion of the Casden Loan is outstanding, Sections 7.14(A), (C), (E) or (F) after repayment of the Casden Loan in full, or SECTION 8 or to amend any provision of this Agreement that expressly requires the consent or approval of Supermajority Lenders, and (ii) without the approval in writing of Administrative Agent and all Lenders, no amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent may be effective to the extent it involves a material change to any material provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or causes any of the following to occur: (a) To reduce the amount of any scheduled payment of principal, principal prepayments or the rate of interest payable on, any Loan, or the amount of any fee or other amount payable to any Lender under the Loan Documents (unless such modification is consented to by each Lender entitled to receive such fee ) or to waive an Event of Default consisting of the failure of Borrowers to pay when due principal, interest or any commitment fee; or (b) To postpone any date fixed for any scheduled payment of principal of, prepayment of principal of, or any installment of interest on, any Loan or any installment of any commitment fee, to extend the term of, or increase the amount of, any Lender's Commitment (it being understood that a waiver of an Event of Default shall not constitute an extension or increase in the Commitment of any Lender) or modify the Pro Rata Share of any Lender; or (c) To amend the provisions of the definition of "REQUISITE LENDERS", "SUPERMAJORITY LENDERS", SECTION 9 or this SECTION 10.01; or (d) To amend any provision of this Agreement that expressly requires the consent or approval of all Lenders; or (e) To (i) release Liens granted in favor of Administrative Agent with respect to any material portion of the Pledged Collateral, other than in connection with dispositions of such Pledged Collateral permitted under this Agreement or the Collateral Documents and provided that the proceeds of any such disposition are applied as required to be applied under this Agreement, including pursuant to SECTION 2.06(b) or (ii) release any Guarantor which is a Material Entity from its obligations under the applicable Guaranty, provided that such Guarantor may be released by Administrative Agent in the event (1) such Guarantor is dissolved, merged, 106
consolidated, liquidated, or wound-up as specifically provided in SECTIONS 6.04 or 7.03 and after giving effect to such dissolution, merger, consolidation, liquidation or winding-up, Borrowers remain in compliance with the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, or (2) there is a sale of the Stock of such Guarantor which complies with the terms of this Agreement, and after giving effect to such sale, Borrowers remain in compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by Issuing Lender in addition to the Requisite Lenders or all Lenders, as the case may be, affect the rights or duties of Issuing Lender under any Loan Document relating to Letters of Credit and (ii) any fee letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed by the parties thereto. Any amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent pursuant to this Section shall apply equally to, and shall be binding upon, all Lenders and Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary, any amendments or replacements of the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the First Amendment to Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of the First Amendment Effective Date, among Borrowers, Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall only require the consent of the Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders. 10.02 TRANSMISSION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF NOTICES AND SIGNATURES. (a) MODES OF DELIVERY. Except as otherwise provided in any Loan Document, notices, requests, demands, directions, agreements and documents delivered in connection with the Loan Documents (collectively, "COMMUNICATIONS") shall be transmitted by Requisite Notice to the number and address set forth on SCHEDULE 10.02, may be delivered by the following modes of delivery, and shall be effective as follows: ; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that communications delivered to Administrative Agent pursuant to SECTION 2 shall not be effective until actually received by Administrative Agent. 107
(b) RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LENDERS. Administrative Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act on any communications purportedly given by or on behalf of any Borrower Party even if such communications (i) were not made in a manner specified herein, (ii) were incomplete, (iii) were not preceded or followed by any other notice specified herein, or (iv) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any subsequent related communications provided for herein.

Signatures on communications may be transmitted by facsimile, electronic mail or other digital transmission only with the consent of Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, in each instance. The effectiveness of any such signatures accepted by Administrative Agent shall, subject to applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manual signatures and shall be binding on all Borrower Parties and Administrative Agent and Lenders. Administrative Agent may also require that any such signature be confirmed by a manually-signed hardcopy thereof. 10.03 ATTORNEY COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES. Borrowers agree (a) to pay or reimburse Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of the Loan Documents, and the development, preparation, negotiation and execution of any amendment, waiver, consent, supplement or modification to, any Loan Documents, and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, all Attorney Costs and the charges of Intralinks or any other electronic document distribution service; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Administrative Agent and Fleet Securities, Inc. not seek more than $10,000 from Borrowers for reimbursement of travel and travel-related expenses through and including the Initial Closing Date; and (b) to pay or reimburse Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each Lender for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with any refinancing, restructuring, reorganization (including a bankruptcy reorganization) and enforcement or attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights under any Loan Documents, and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, or in connection with any refinancing, or restructuring of any such documents in the nature of a "workout" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, including, without limitation, Attorney Costs.

10.04 BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT. (a) GENERALLY. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; PROVIDED that none of the Borrower Parties may assign and transfer any of their interests without the prior written consent of all the Lenders and Administrative Agent; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the rights of each Lender to transfer, assign or grant participants in its rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be limited as set forth below in this Section 10.04. (b) ASSIGNMENTS. Each Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Loans, its Notes, and its Commitment); PROVIDED HOWEVER, that: (i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee; (ii) except (A) in the case of an assignment to another Lender, (B) in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, or (C) with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, any such partial assignment shall be in an amount at least equal to the applicable Minimum Amount (or, if less, the remaining amount of the Commitment being assigned by such Lender) or an integral multiple of the applicable Minimum Amount in excess thereof; (iii) each such assignment by a Lender shall be of a constant, and not varying, percentage of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes; (iv) the parties to such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the Borrowers for their acceptance an Assignment and Acceptance in substantially the form of EXHIBIT D, together with a processing fee from the assignor of $3,500; and (v) such assignment, if not to a Lender or an Affiliate of an assigning Lender, shall require the approval of Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of a Default or Event of Default and Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender (which approval of Borrowers or Administrative Agent or Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and if Borrowers do not respond during such ten (10) Business Days after receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance, such assignment shall be deemed approved. Upon execution, delivery, and acceptance of such Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of such assignment, have the obligations, rights, and benefits of a Lender hereunder and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement. Upon the consummation of any assignment pursuant to this Section 10.04(b), the assignor, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if 109
required, new Notes are issued to the assignor and the assignee. If the assignee is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof, it shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of taxes in accordance with Section 3.01.

(c) REGISTER. The Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance Agreement delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment of any Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance; 110
thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated Assignee, and the old Notes shall be returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled." The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) ACCEPTANCE. Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by the parties thereto, together with any Note subject to such assignment and payment of the processing fee, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment Agreement has been completed and is in substantially the form of EXHIBIT D, (i) accept such Assignment Agreement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the parties thereto. (e) PARTICIPATIONS. Each Lender may, without notice to or consent of Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more Persons (each a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights, obligations or rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and its Loans); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of the right of set-off contained in Section 10.05, (iv) the Borrowers and Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (v) such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers relating to their Loans and its Notes and to approve any amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications, or waivers decreasing the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on such Loans or Notes, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on such Loans or Notes, extending its Commitment, reducing the amount or changing the date of payment of the facility fee described in Section 2.09(a) payable to such participant, releasing all or substantially all of the Pledged Collateral or releasing the Borrowers or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from its or their respective obligations under the Loan Documents). (f) NONRESTRICTED ASSIGNMENTS. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to the Regulation A and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment shall release the assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder. 10.05 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and Lenders or any assignee or participant of Lenders or any Affiliates thereof (each, a "PROCEEDING PARTY") provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Proceeding Party is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to Borrowers, any such notice being waived by Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by law, to proceed directly, by right of set-off, banker's lien, or otherwise, against any assets of the Borrower Parties which may be in the hands of such Proceeding Party (including all general or 111
special, time or demand, provisional or other deposits and other indebtedness owing by such Proceeding Party to or for the credit or the account of Borrowers) and apply such assets against the Obligations, irrespective of whether such Proceeding Party shall have made any demand therefor and although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Borrowers and Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 10.06 SHARING OF PAYMENT. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each Lender severally agrees that if it, through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim against Borrowers, or otherwise, receives payment of the Obligations held by it that is ratably more than any other Lender, through any means, receives in payment of the Obligations held by that Lender, then, subject to applicable Laws: (a) Lender exercising the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or otherwise receiving such payment shall purchase, and shall be deemed to have simultaneously purchased, from the other Lenders a participation in the Obligations held by the other Lenders and shall pay to the other Lenders a purchase price in an amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each Lender after the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment shall be in the same proportion that existed prior to the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment; and (b) such other adjustments and purchases of participations shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure that all Lenders share any payment obtained in respect of the Obligations ratably in accordance with each Lender's share of the Obligations immediately prior to, and without taking into account, the payment; PROVIDED that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate payment obtained as a result of the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender by Borrowers or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of Borrowers, the purchase of a participation shall be rescinded and the purchase price thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery, but without interest. Each Lender that purchases a participation in the Obligations pursuant to this Section shall from and after the purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased. Borrowers expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any Lender holding a participation in an Obligation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim with respect to the participation as fully as if Lender were the original owner of the Obligation purchased. 10.07 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. (a) No failure by any Lender or Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any Lender or Administrative Agent in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under any Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. 112
(b) The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein or therein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law. Any decision by Administrative Agent or any Lender not to require payment of any interest (including Default Interest), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document or to calculate any amount payable by a particular method on any occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a waiver of Administrative Agent's or such Lender's right to require full payment thereof, or to calculate an amount payable by another method that is not inconsistent with this Agreement, on any other or subsequent occasion. (c) The terms and conditions of SECTION 9 are inserted for the sole benefit of Administrative Agent and Lenders; the same may be waived in whole or in part, with or without terms or conditions, in respect of any Extension of Credit without prejudicing Administrative Agent's or Lenders' rights to assert them in whole or in part in respect of any other Loan. 10.08 USURY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest and fees paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "MAXIMUM RATE"). If Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest or a fee in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excessive interest or fee shall be applied to the principal of the Outstanding Obligations or, if it exceeds the unpaid principal, refunded to Borrowers. In determining whether the interest or a fee contracted for, charged, or received by Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations. 10.09 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with Borrowers and the Administrative Agent. 10.10 INTEGRATION; CONFLICTS WITH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents and any letter agreements referred to herein, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on the subject matter hereof. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties hereto. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control and govern; PROVIDED that the inclusion of 113
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of Administrative Agent or Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof. 10.11 NATURE OF LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and not joint or joint and several. Nothing contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by Administrative Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to, make Lenders a partnership, an association, a joint venture or other entity, either among themselves or with Borrowers or any Affiliate of Borrowers. Each Lender's obligation to make the initial Loan is conditioned upon the performance by all other Lenders of their obligations to make initial Loans. A default by any Lender will not increase the Pro Rata Share attributable to any other Lender. 10.12 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any Loan Document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery thereof but shall terminate on the later of (a) when the Commitments are terminated and (b) when no Obligations remain outstanding under any Loan Document. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by Administrative Agent and each Lender, notwithstanding any investigation made by Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf. PROVIDED, HOWEVER, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of Borrowers set forth in SECTION 3 and SUBSECTIONS 10.03, 10.05, 10.13, and 10.14 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in SUBSECTIONS 9.03, 9.07, 10.06, and 11.01(f) shall survive the payment of the other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 10.13 INDEMNITY BY BORROWERS. Borrowers agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless Administrative Agent-Related Persons and each Lender and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, attorneys and employees, or any holding company thereof (collectively the "INDEMNITEES") from and against: (a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action, including, without limitation, any environmental claims, actions, demands or causes of action (except a claim, demand, action, or cause of action for Taxes of Lenders) if the claim, demand, action or cause of action arises out of or relates to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance or administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any other such documents, including, without limitation, any act or omission (or alleged act or omission) of any Borrower Party, its Affiliates or any of their officers, directors or stockholders relating to the Commitments, the use or contemplated use of proceeds of any Loan, or the relationship of any Borrower Party and Lenders under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the granting of any pledge or security interest in the Pledged Collateral; (b) any administrative or investigative proceeding by any Governmental Authority arising out of or related to a claim, demand, action 114
or cause of action described in subsection (a) above; and (c) any and all liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, judgments, disbursements, costs or expenses of any kind whatsoever (including settlement costs or Attorney Costs) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action or cause of action thereto, including those liabilities caused by an Indemnitee's own negligence (all the foregoing, collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); PROVIDED that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any loss caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or for any loss asserted against it by another Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unauthorized persons of Information or other materials sent through electronic telecommunications or other information transmission systems that are intercepted by such persons or for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in connection with the Loans. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrowers agree not to assert and to cause their Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waives and agrees to cause their Subsidiaries so to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee. 10.14 NONLIABILITY OF LENDERS. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (a) It has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (b) Any inspections of any Property of Borrowers made by or through Administrative Agent or Lenders are for purposes of administration of the Loan Documents only, and Borrowers are not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or not such inspections are at the expense of Borrowers); (c) By accepting or approving anything required to be observed, performed, fulfilled or given to Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to the Loan Documents, neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall be deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by Administrative Agent or Lenders; (d) The relationship between Borrowers and Administrative Agent and Lenders is, and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrowers and lenders; neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall under any circumstance be construed to be partners or joint venturers of Borrowers or their Affiliates; neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders shall under any circumstance be deemed to be in a relationship of confidence or trust or a fiduciary relationship with Borrowers or their Affiliates, or to owe any fiduciary duty to Borrowers or their Affiliates; neither Administrative Agent nor Lenders undertake or assume any responsibility or duty to Borrowers or their Affiliates to select, review, inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrowers or their Affiliates of any matter in connection with their Property or the 115
operations of Borrowers or their Affiliates; Borrowers and their Affiliates shall rely entirely upon their own judgment with respect to such matters; and any review, inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment or supply of information undertaken or assumed by Administrative Agent or Lenders in connection with such matters is solely for the protection of Administrative Agent and Lenders and none of Borrowers nor any other Person is entitled to rely thereon; and (e) Administrative Agent and Lenders shall not be responsible or liable to any Person for any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind relating to injury or death to Persons or damage to Property caused by the actions, inaction or negligence of Borrowers and/or their Affiliates and Borrowers hereby indemnify and holds Administrative Agent and Lenders harmless from any such loss, damage, liability or claim. 10.15 NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED. This Agreement is made for the purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Lenders in connection with the Loans, and is made for the sole benefit of Borrowers, Administrative Agent and Lenders, and Administrative Agent's and Lenders' successors and assigns. Except as provided in SECTIONS 10.04 and 10.13, no other Person shall have any rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof. 10.16 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of the Loan Documents that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 10.17 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty (or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional advisor) to any credit derivative transaction relating to obligations of the Borrowers; (g) with the consent of the Borrowers; (h) to 116

In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrowers relating to the Borrowers or their business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrowers after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified in writing at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

(iii) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Borrower will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation. (iv) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this SECTION 10.25 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each such Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever.

Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by the Administrative Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default 121
by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by the Administrative Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this SECTION 10.25 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this SECTION 10.25, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such Borrower under this SECTION 10.25 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this SECTION 10.25 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any Borrower or the Administrative Agent or Lender. The joint and several liability of each Borrower hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the name, constitution or place of formation of any of the Borrowers or Administrative Agent or Lenders. (vi) The provisions of this SECTION 10.25 are made for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Administrative Agent, or any Lender, successor or assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this SECTION 10.25 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this SECTION 10.25 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made. (vii) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, 122
any payments made by it to the Administrative Agent or Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may have against the other Borrowers with respect to any payments to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, including without limitation, as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to the other Borrowers therefor. 10.26 LENDER COVENANT. Each Lender hereby covenants and agrees that it shall notify Administrative Agent, in writing, immediately upon becoming a Casden Lender or Term Loan Lender and upon any Affiliate becoming a Casden Lender or a Term Loan Lender. 10.27 RELEASE OF COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, upon request of Borrowers in connection with any Disposition of Property permitted by the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) cause the Collateral Agent to (i) take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in any Pledged Collateral being Disposed of in such Disposition, and (ii) to release any guarantee obligations under any Loan Document of any Person being Disposed of in such Disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any other Loan Document, when all Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments have terminated or expired, upon request of Borrowers, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender) cause the Collateral Agent to take such actions as shall be required to release its security interest in all Pledged Collateral (on behalf of the Revolver Lenders only), and to release all guarantee obligations under any Loan Document (on behalf of the Revolver Lenders only). Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be deemed subject to the provision that such guarantee obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Borrowers or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, Borrowers or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 123
SECTION 11. COLLATERAL AGENT 11.01 COLLATERAL AGENT. (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes Bank of America as Collateral Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral Documents with such powers as are specifically granted to the Collateral Agent by the terms thereof, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and expressly authorizes the Collateral Agent as its agent to execute, deliver and perform the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to act as Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents (subject to and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), and the Intercreditor Agreement and Bank of America, in its individual capacity, accepts such appointment as Collateral Agent thereunder by executing the Borrowers Pledge Agreement, which appointment is coupled with an interest. Each Lender hereby agrees to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to a "Lender" therein. (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or the Collateral Documents, Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in this Section 11, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, nor shall Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in the Collateral Documents with reference to Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. (c) Collateral Agent may execute any of its duties under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. (d) None of Collateral Agent-Related Persons (defined below) shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrowers, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or for any failure of Borrowers or any other party to any Loan Document to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Collateral Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to 124
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of Borrowers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates. "Collateral Agent-Related Persons" means Collateral Agent (including any successor agent), together with its Affiliates (including, in the case of Collateral Agent, Banc of America Securities LLC), and the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of such Persons and Affiliates. (e) Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by Collateral Agent. Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Requisite Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with a request or consent of the Requisite Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all Lenders. (f) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Collateral Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Pledgors (as defined in the Borrowers Pledge Agreement) and without limiting the obligation of Pledgors to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Collateral Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Collateral Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no action taken in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Collateral Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Collateral Agent after the Initial Closing Date in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or any document contemplated by or referred to therein, to the extent that Collateral Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrower Parties. The undertaking in this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Collateral Agent. (g) Collateral Agent may, and at the request of 66-2/3% of the Benefited Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall, resign as Collateral Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lenders. If Collateral Agent resigns under the Collateral Documents and Intercreditor Agreement, the Majority Benefited Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor 125
Agreement) shall appoint from among the Casden Lenders, Revolver Lenders or Term Lenders, a successor collateral agent, and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such successor collateral agent shall require the approval of Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that if no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent may appoint, after consulting with such Lenders and Borrowers, a successor collateral agent from among such Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, such successor collateral agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent and the term "Collateral Agent" shall mean such successor collateral agent and the retiring Collateral Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement shall be terminated. After any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement as the collateral agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and Intercreditor Agreement. If no successor collateral agent has accepted appointment as Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Collateral Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Collateral Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and Majority Benefited Parties shall perform all of the duties of Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Benefited Parties appoint a successor collateral agent as provided for above.

EXHIBIT 10.5 AMENDED AND RESTATED PAYMENT GUARANTY This AMENDED AND RESTATED PAYMENT GUARANTY ("GUARANTY") is made as of May 30, 2003, by the undersigned entities (each a "GUARANTOR") in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. ("BANK OF AMERICA"), as Administrative Agent for itself and the lenders ("LENDERS") from time to time party to the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (in such capacity, "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT"), which amends and restates each of the Payment Guaranty (Casden Guarantors) and the Payment Guaranty (Revolver Guarantors), each dated as of March 11, 2002 and as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, among the respective parties. FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Lenders have made a $400,000,000 credit facility available to Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("REIT") AIMCO Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("AIMCO"), AIMCO/Bethesda Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AIMCO/BETHESDA"), and NHP Management Company, a District of Columbia corporation ("NHP MANAGEMENT") (the REIT, AIMCO, AIMCO/Bethesda and NHP Management are collectively referred to as "BORROWERS"), in accordance with the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 11, 2002, as amended to date including as amended by that certain Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of February 14, 2003, that certain First Amendment to Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 9, 2003, and that certain Second Amendment to Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 30, 2003, (as amended to date the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), by and among Borrowers, Bank of America (as Administrative Agent), Fleet National Bank (as Syndication Agent), First Union National Bank (as Documentation Agent), Banc of America Securities LLC and Fleet Securities Inc., as Co-Lead Arrangers and Banc of America Securities LLC, as Sole Book Manager, and the other Lenders from time to time party thereto. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers have obtained this Guaranty from the Guarantors. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. As used herein, the term "FACILITY" shall refer individually to each of the credit facilities available to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement. GUARANTY 1. GUARANTY OF LOAN (a) ABSOLUTE GUARANTY. Each Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to Administrative Agent and the Lenders as primary obligors the full payment of the Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), and unconditionally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders the full amount of the Indebtedness. This is a guaranty of payment, not of collection. If Borrowers default in the payment when due of the Indebtedness or any part of it, each Guarantor will in lawful money of the United States pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on demand, all sums due and owing on the Indebtedness, including all interest, charges, fees and other sums, costs and expenses. H-1
(b) Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the "FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS"), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (x) in respect of intercompany indebtedness to Borrowers or other affiliates of Borrowers to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (y) under any guaranty of subordinated Indebtedness which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that set forth in this Section 1, pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution of such Guarantor pursuant to applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement. 2. LOAN. In this Guaranty, the term "Indebtedness" is broadly defined to mean and include all primary, secondary, direct, indirect, fixed and contingent obligations of Borrowers to pay principal, interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under debtor relief laws at the rate or in the amount otherwise applicable thereto whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in any such proceeding), prepayment charges, breakage costs, late charges, loan fees and any other fees, charges, sums, costs and expenses that may be owing at any time under the Loan Documents, as any or all of such obligations may from time to time be modified, amended, extended or renewed. If the amount outstanding under the Indebtedness is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination shall be conclusive and binding on each Guarantor, regardless of whether such Guarantor was a party to the proceeding in which the determination was made or not. 3. RIGHTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS. Each Guarantor authorizes Administrative Agent or any Lender to perform any or all of the following acts at any time in its sole discretion, all without notice to such Guarantor and without affecting such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty: (a) Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders may alter any terms of the Indebtedness or any part of it, including renewing, compromising, extending or accelerating, or otherwise changing the time for payment of, or increasing or decreasing the rate of interest on, the Indebtedness or any part of it. (b) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may take and hold security for the Indebtedness or this Guaranty, accept additional or substituted security for either, and subordinate, exchange, enforce, waive, release, compromise, fail to perfect and sell or otherwise dispose of any such security in accordance with the terms of the Indebtedness. H-2
(c) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may direct the order and manner of any sale of all or any part of any security now or later to be held for the Indebtedness or this Guaranty, and Administrative Agent or any Lender may also bid at any such sale. (d) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may apply any payments or recoveries from Borrowers, Guarantors or any other source, and any proceeds of any security, to Borrowers' obligations under the Loan Documents in such manner, order and priority as Administrative Agent or such Lender may elect, whether or not those obligations are guarantied by this Guaranty or secured at the time of the application. (e) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may release Borrowers of their liability for the Indebtedness or any part of it. (f) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may substitute, add or release any one or more Guarantors, other guarantors or endorsers. (g) In addition to the Indebtedness, Administrative Agent or any Lender may extend other credit to Borrowers, and may take and hold security for the credit so extended, all without affecting any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty. 4. GUARANTY TO BE ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that until the Indebtedness is paid and performed in full and each and every term, covenant and condition of this Guaranty is fully performed, such Guarantor shall not be released by or because of: (a) Any act or event (other than payment and performance in full of the Indebtedness) which might otherwise discharge, reduce, limit or modify such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty; (b) Any waiver, extension, modification, forbearance, delay or other act or omission of Administrative Agent or any Lender, or its failure to proceed promptly or otherwise as against Borrowers, any Guarantor or any security; (c) Any action, omission or circumstance that might increase the likelihood that such Guarantor may be called upon to perform under this Guaranty or that might affect the rights or remedies of such Guarantor as against Borrowers; (d) Any dealings occurring at any time between Borrowers and Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether relating to the Indebtedness or otherwise; or (e) Any action of Administrative Agent or any Lender described in Section 3 above. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that absent this Section 4, such Guarantor might have a defense to the enforcement of this Guaranty as a result of one or more of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. Each Guarantor hereby expressly H-3
waives and surrenders any defense to its liability under this Guaranty based upon any of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. It is the purpose and intent of this Guaranty that the obligations of each Guarantor under it shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. 5. GUARANTORS' WAIVERS. Each Guarantor waives: (a) All statutes of limitations as a defense to any action or proceeding brought against such Guarantor by Administrative Agent or any Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) Any right it may have to require Administrative Agent or any Lender to proceed against Borrowers, proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrowers, or pursue any other remedy in Administrative Agent's or any Lender's power to pursue; (c) Any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrowers; (d) Any defense based on: (i) any legal disability of Borrowers, (ii) any release, discharge, modification, impairment or limitation of the liability of Borrowers to Administrative Agent or any Lender from any cause, whether consented to by Administrative Agent or any Lender or arising by operation of law or from any bankruptcy or other voluntary or involuntary proceeding, in or out of court, for the adjustment of debtor-creditor relationships ("Insolvency Proceeding"), and (iii) any rejection or disaffirmance of the Indebtedness, or any part of it, or any security held for it, in any such Insolvency Proceeding; (e) Any defense based on any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent or any Lender in any Insolvency Proceeding involving Borrowers, including any election to have Administrative Agent's or that Lender's claim allowed as being secured, partially secured or unsecured, any extension of credit by Lender to Borrowers in any Insolvency Proceeding, and the taking and holding by Administrative Agent or any Lender of any security for any such extension of credit; (f) All presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, and demands and notices of every kind except for any demand or notice by Administrative Agent or any Lender to such Guarantor expressly provided for in Section 1; (g) Any defense based on or arising out of any defense that Borrowers may have to the payment or performance of the Indebtedness or any part of it (other than indefeasible payment in full); and (h) Any defense based on or arising out of any action of Administrative Agent or any Lender described in Sections 3 or 4 above. H-4
6. WAIVERS OF SUBROGATION AND OTHER RIGHTS. (a) During the existence of an Event of Default, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Collateral Documents, Administrative Agent or any Lender (subject to Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement), without prior notice to or consent of any Guarantor, may elect to: (i) foreclose either judicially or nonjudicially against any real or personal property security it may hold for the Indebtedness, (ii) accept a transfer of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, (iii) compromise or adjust the Indebtedness or any part of it or make any other accommodation with Borrowers or Guarantors, or (iv) exercise any other remedy against Borrowers or any security. No such action by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall release or limit the liability of Guarantors, who shall remain liable under this Guaranty after the action, even if the effect of the action is to deprive Guarantors of any subrogation rights, rights of indemnity, or other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrowers for any sums paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether contractual or arising by operation of law or otherwise. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that under no circumstances shall it be deemed to have any right, title, interest or claim in or to any real or personal property to be held by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any third party after any foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure of any security for the Indebtedness. (b) Regardless of whether any Guarantor may have made any payments to any Administrative Agent or Lender, each Guarantor hereby waives: (i) all rights of subrogation, all rights of indemnity, and any other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrowers for any sums paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether contractual or arising by operation of law (including the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor or similar statute) or otherwise, (ii) all rights to enforce any remedy that Lender may have against Borrowers, and (iii) all rights to participate in any security now or later to be held by Administrative Agent or any Lender for the Indebtedness, in each case until the full and indefeasible payment and performance of all Indebtedness, and all obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. (c) Each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, even though that election of remedies may affect such Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the Borrowers by the operation of law or otherwise. In addition, each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that such Guarantor may have because the Borrowers' indebtedness is secured by real property. This means, among other things, that Administrative Agent and the Lenders may collect from such Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the Borrowers. 7. REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT. If Administrative Agent or any Lender is required to pay, return or restore to Borrowers or any other person any amounts previously paid on the Indebtedness because of any Insolvency Proceeding of Borrowers, any stop notice or any other reason, the obligations of Guarantors shall be reinstated and revived and the rights of Administrative Agent and such Lender shall continue with regard to such amounts, all as though they had never been paid. H-5
8. INFORMATION REGARDING BORROWERS. Before signing this Guaranty, each Guarantor investigated the financial condition and business operations of Borrowers and such other matters as such Guarantor deemed appropriate to assure itself of Borrowers' ability to discharge their obligations under the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor assumes full responsibility for that due diligence, as well as for keeping informed of all matters that may affect Borrowers' ability to pay and perform their obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty to disclose to any Guarantor any information which such party may have or receive about Borrowers' financial condition, business operations, or any other circumstances bearing on their ability to perform. 9. SUBORDINATION. Any rights of Guarantors, whether now existing or later arising, to receive payment on account of any indebtedness (including interest) owed to any of them by Borrowers or any Guarantor thereof or to receive any payment from Borrowers or any such Guarantor other than those payments or distributions permitted under Sections 7.07 and 7.10 of the Credit Agreement shall at all times be subordinate as to lien and time of payment and in all other respects to the full and prior repayment of the Indebtedness. No Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce or receive payment of any sums hereby subordinated until the Indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and any such sums received in violation of this Guaranty shall be received by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. 10. FINANCIAL INFORMATION. Each Guarantor shall keep true and correct financial books and records, using generally accepted accounting principles which are applicable to the circumstances as of the date of determination, or such other accounting principles as the Requisite Lenders in their reasonable judgment may find acceptable from time to time. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants to Administrative Agent and the Lenders that all financial information with respect to such Guarantor delivered or to be delivered to Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrowers with respect to such Guarantor under Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement is or shall be true and correct and fairly presents or will fairly present the financial position of such Guarantor for the applicable period in accordance with GAAP except as otherwise noted therein. Each Guarantor shall promptly provide Administrative Agent and the Lenders with any additional audited financial information that such Guarantor may obtain, and such other information concerning its affairs and properties as Administrative Agent or any Lender may reasonably request, including, without limitation, signed copies of any tax returns if requested by Administrative Agent or the Lenders. 11. GUARANTORS' REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that: (a) All financial statements delivered to Administrative Agent or the Lenders were or will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which are applicable to the circumstances as of the date of determination, or such other accounting principles as may be acceptable to the Requisite Lenders at the time of their preparation; (b) There has been no material adverse change in such Guarantor's financial condition since the dates of the statements most recently furnished to Administrative Agent and the Lenders; and H-6
(c) All representations and warranties given on behalf of or with respect to such Guarantor contained in SECTION 5 of the Credit Agreement and in any other Loan Document or certification made in connection with the Credit Agreement are true and correct. 12. COVENANTS OF GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that it shall comply with and perform all covenants given on behalf of or with respect to such Guarantor (whether expressly or as a Subsidiary) contained in Sections 6 and 7 of the Credit Agreement and in all other Loan Documents. 13. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 14. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 15. AUTHORIZATION; NO VIOLATION. Each Guarantor is authorized to execute, deliver and perform under this Guaranty, which is a valid, binding, and enforceable obligation of such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally. The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty are not in violation of any applicable law, regulation or ordinance, or any order or ruling of any court or governmental agency applicable to such Guarantor. The Guaranty does not conflict with, or constitute a breach or default under, any agreement to which such Guarantor is a party. 16. ADDITIONAL AND INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are in addition to its obligations under any future guaranties, each of which shall remain in full force and effect until it is expressly modified or released in a writing signed by Administrative Agent and consented to by the Lenders. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are independent of those of Borrowers on the Indebtedness. Subject to Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement, Administrative Agent or the Lenders may bring a separate action, or commence a separate arbitration proceeding against each Guarantor without first proceeding against Borrowers, any other person or any security that Administrative Agent or any Lender may hold, and without pursuing any other remedy. None of Administrative Agent's or any Lender's rights under this Guaranty shall be exhausted by any action by Administrative Agent or any Lender until the Indebtedness has been paid and performed in full in cash. 17. NO WAIVER; CONSENTS; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. Each waiver by Administrative Agent or the Lenders must be in writing, and no waiver shall be construed as a continuing waiver. No waiver shall be implied from Administrative Agent's or any Lender's delay in exercising or failure to exercise any right or remedy against Borrowers, any Guarantor or any security. Consent by Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any act or omission by Borrowers or any Guarantor shall not be construed as a consent to any other or subsequent act or omission, or as a waiver of the requirement for Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' consent to be obtained in any future or other instance. All remedies of Administrative Agent and each Lender against Borrowers and Guarantors are cumulative. 18. NO RELEASE. Except as otherwise provided in Section 1, no Guarantor shall be released, in whole or in part, from its obligations under this Guaranty except by a writing H-7
signed by Administrative Agent and the requisite consent of Lenders as specifically required under the Credit Agreement, if any. 19. HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS. The terms of this Guaranty shall bind and benefit the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Guarantors; provided, however, that no Guarantor may assign this Guaranty, or assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Guaranty, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent in each instance. Without notice to or the consent of Guarantors, Administrative Agent and any Lender may disclose any and all information in its possession concerning Guarantors, this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty to any actual or prospective purchaser of any securities issued or to be issued by Administrative Agent or such Lender, and to any actual or prospective purchaser or assignee of any participation or other interest in the Indebtedness and this Guaranty; provided each recipient of such information agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of Section 10.17 of the Credit Agreement for the benefit of the Borrowers and the Guarantors. 20. NOTICES. (a) DELIVERY. All notices, requests and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, telegraphic, telex, facsimile transmission or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed, telexed or delivered to the recipient's address specified on the signature pages hereof, or to such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party. (b) RECEIPT. All such notices and communications shall, when transmitted by overnight delivery, telegraphed, telecopied by facsimile, telexed or cabled, be effective when delivered for overnight delivery or to the telegraph company, transmitted by telecopier, confirmed by telex answerback or delivered to the cable company, respectively, or if delivered, upon delivery. (c) RELIANCE. Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any person purporting to be a person authorized by Guarantors to give such notice, and neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability to any Guarantor or any other person on account of any action taken or not taken by Administrative Agent or such Lender in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The obligation of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by Lender to receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by Administrative Agent or a Lender of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms understood by Administrative Agent or such Lender to be contained in the telephonic or facsimile notice. 21. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. In this Guaranty, the word "Borrowers" includes both the named Borrowers and any other person who at any time assumes or otherwise becomes primarily liable for all or any part of the obligations of the named Borrowers on the Indebtedness. If this Guaranty is executed by more than one person, the word "Guarantors" includes all such persons. The word "include(s)" means "include(s), without limitation," and the H-8
word "including" means "including, but not limited to." When the context and construction so require, all words used in the singular shall be deemed to have been used in the plural and vice versa. No listing of specific instances, items or matters in any way limits the scope or generality of any language of this Guaranty. All headings appearing in this Guaranty are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Guaranty. 22. GOVERNING LAW. This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to its choice of law rules. 23. COSTS AND EXPENSES. If any lawsuit or arbitration is commenced which arises out of, or which relates to this Guaranty, the Loan Documents or the Indebtedness, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from each other party such sums as the court or arbitrator may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for services of in-house counsel) in the action or proceeding, in addition to costs and expenses otherwise allowed by law. In all other situations, including any Insolvency Proceeding, the Guarantors agree to pay all of the Administrative Agent's and each Lender's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for services of the Administrative Agent's and each Lender's in-house counsel) which may be incurred in any effort to collect or enforce the Indebtedness or any part of it or any term of this Guaranty. Without limiting any rights of the Administrative Agent or Lenders under the Credit Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts of any kind due and payable under this Guaranty (whether for principal, interest, and other costs under the Indebtedness, or for costs, fees, and expenses for which the Guarantors are directly responsible hereunder, or otherwise) shall accrue interest from the time the Administrative Agent or the Lenders make demand therefor hereunder until paid in full in cash to such Administrative Agent or the Lenders at the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus three percentage points (3%), except to the extent that any such amounts are then accruing interest under the Indebtedness, in which case such Base Rate plus 3% interest rate shall not be applied if the effect would be to compound the interest to which such obligations are subject to under the Indebtedness. 24. COVENANT. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that it will make dividend payments on its outstanding preferred stock with its excess cash to the extent such cash is not required by such Guarantor for its business, consistent with prudent business practices and its cash requirements. 25.

No course of prior dealing, usage of trade, parol or extrinsic evidence of any nature shall be used to supplement, modify or vary any of the terms hereof.

Each Lender hereby agrees to be bound by provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to a "Lender" therein. (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or the Collateral Documents, Collateral Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in this Section 11.01, the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, nor shall Collateral Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in the Collateral Documents with reference to Collateral Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. (c) Collateral Agent may execute any of its duties under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects with reasonable care. 11
(d) None of Collateral Agent-Related Persons (defined below) shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Borrowers, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Collateral Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or for any failure of Borrowers or any other party to any Loan Document to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Collateral Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the Properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of Borrowers' Subsidiaries or Affiliates. "Collateral Agent-Related Persons" means Collateral Agent (including any successor agent), together with its Affiliates (including, in the case of Collateral Agent, Banc of America Securities LLC), and the officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact of such Persons and Affiliates. (e) Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by Collateral Agent. Collateral Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Requisite Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Collateral Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with a request or consent of the Requisite Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all Lenders. (f) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Collateral Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Pledgors (as defined in the Borrowers Pledge Agreement) and without limiting the obligation of Pledgors to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Collateral Agent-Related Person from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Collateral Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no action taken in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall 12
reimburse Collateral Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by Collateral Agent after the Closing Date in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, the Collateral Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or any document contemplated by or referred to therein, to the extent that Collateral Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrower Parties. The undertaking in this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of Collateral Agent. (g) Collateral Agent may, and at the request of more than 66 2/3% of the Benefited Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall, resign as Collateral Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to Lenders. If Collateral Agent resigns under the Collateral Documents and Intercreditor Agreement, the Majority Benefited Parties shall appoint from among the Lenders, Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) or Term Lenders, a successor collateral agent, and, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such successor collateral agent shall require the approval of Borrowers (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that if no successor collateral agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Collateral Agent, Collateral Agent may appoint, after consulting with such Lenders and Borrowers, a successor collateral agent from among such Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor collateral agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, such successor Collateral Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Collateral Agent and the term "Collateral Agent" shall mean such successor collateral agent and the retiring Collateral Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement shall be terminated. After any retiring Collateral Agent's resignation under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement as the collateral agent, the provisions of this subsection shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. If no successor collateral agent has accepted appointment as Collateral Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Collateral Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Collateral Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and Majority Benefited Parties shall perform all of the duties of Collateral Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Benefited Parties appoint a successor collateral agent as provided for above. 23.

Exhibit 10.7 FORM OF AMENDED AND RESTATED PAYMENT GUARANTY This AMENDED AND RESTATED PAYMENT GUARANTY ("GUARANTY") is made as of May 30, 2003, by the undersigned entities (each a "GUARANTOR") in favor of LEHMAN COMMERCIAL PAPER INC. ("LCPI"), as Administrative Agent for itself and the lenders ("LENDERS") from time to time party to the Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (in such capacity, "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT"), which amends and restates each of the Payment Guaranty (Casden Guarantors) and the Payment Guaranty (Non-Casden), each dated as of March 11, 2002 and as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified prior to the date hereof, among the respective parties hereto. FACTUAL BACKGROUND The Lenders have made a $287,000,000 credit facility available to AIMCO Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("AIMCO"), NHP Management Company, a District of Columbia corporation ("NHP MANAGEMENT") and Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation (the "REIT") (AIMCO, NHP Management and the REIT are collectively referred to as "BORROWERS"), in accordance with the Interim Credit Agreement (as amended to date, the "CREDIT AGREEMENT"), dated as of March 11, 2002, by and among Borrowers, LCPI (as Administrative Agent, as Syndication Agent and as a lender), and Lehman Brothers Inc., as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner, and the other Lenders from time to time party thereto. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. As used herein, the term "FACILITY" shall refer to the credit facility available to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement. GUARANTY 1. GUARANTY OF LOAN; ABSOLUTE GUARANTY. Each Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to Administrative Agent and the Lenders as primary obligors the full payment of the Indebtedness (as hereinafter defined), and unconditionally agrees to pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders the full amount of the Indebtedness. This is a guaranty of payment, not of collection. If Borrowers default in the payment when due of the Indebtedness or any part of it, each Guarantor will in lawful money of the United States pay to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on demand, all sums due and owing on the Indebtedness, including all interest, charges, fees and other sums, costs and expenses. 2. LOAN. In this Guaranty, the term "Indebtedness" is broadly defined to mean and include all primary, secondary, direct, indirect, fixed and contingent obligations of Borrowers to pay principal, interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under debtor relief laws at the rate or in the amount otherwise applicable thereto whether or not such interest is an allowed claim in any such proceeding), prepayment charges, breakage costs, late charges, loan fees and any other fees, charges, sums, costs and expenses that may be owing at any time under the Loan Documents, as any or all of such obligations may from time to time be modified, amended, extended or renewed. If the amount outstanding under the Indebtedness is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, that determination shall be conclusive and 1
binding on each Guarantor, regardless of whether such Guarantor was a party to the proceeding in which the determination was made or not. 3. RIGHTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS. Each Guarantor authorizes Administrative Agent or any Lender to perform any or all of the following acts at any time in its sole discretion, all without notice to such Guarantor and without affecting such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty: (a) Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders may alter any terms of the Indebtedness or any part of it, including renewing, compromising, extending or accelerating, or otherwise changing the time for payment of, or increasing or decreasing the rate of interest on, the Indebtedness or any part of it. (b) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may take and hold security for the Indebtedness or this Guaranty, accept additional or substituted security for either, and subordinate, exchange, enforce, waive, release, compromise, fail to perfect and sell or otherwise dispose of any such security in accordance with the terms of the Indebtedness. (c) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may direct the order and manner of any sale of all or any part of any security now or later to be held for the Indebtedness or this Guaranty, and Administrative Agent or any Lender may also bid at any such sale. (d) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may apply any payments or recoveries from Borrowers, Guarantors or any other source, and any proceeds of any security, to Borrowers' obligations under the Loan Documents in such manner, order and priority as Administrative Agent or such Lender may elect, whether or not those obligations are guarantied by this Guaranty or secured at the time of the application. (e) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may release Borrowers of their liability for the Indebtedness or any part of it. (f) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, Administrative Agent or any Lender may substitute, add or release any one or more Guarantors, other guarantors or endorsers. (g) Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, in addition to the Indebtedness, Administrative Agent or any Lender may extend other credit to Borrowers, and may take and hold security for the credit so extended, all without affecting any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty. 4. GUARANTY TO BE ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that until the Indebtedness is paid and performed in full and each and every term, covenant and condition of this Guaranty is fully performed, such Guarantor shall not be released by or because of: 2
(a) Any act or event (other than payment and performance in full of the Indebtedness) which might otherwise discharge, reduce, limit or modify such Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty; (b) Any waiver, extension, modification, forbearance, delay or other act or omission of Administrative Agent or any Lender, or its failure to proceed promptly or otherwise as against Borrowers, any Guarantor or any security; (c) Any action, omission or circumstance that might increase the likelihood that such Guarantor may be called upon to perform under this Guaranty or that might affect the rights or remedies of such Guarantor as against Borrowers; (d) Any dealings occurring at any time between Borrowers and Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether relating to the Indebtedness or otherwise; or (e) Any action of Administrative Agent or any Lender described in Section 3 above. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that absent this Section 4, Guarantor might have a defense to the enforcement of this Guaranty as a result of one or more of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. Each Guarantor hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defense to its liability under this Guaranty based upon any of the foregoing acts, omissions, agreements, waivers or matters. It is the purpose and intent of this Guaranty that the obligations of each Guarantor under it shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances. 5. GUARANTORS' WAIVERS. Each Guarantor waives: (a) All statutes of limitations as a defense to any action or proceeding brought against such Guarantor by Administrative Agent or any Lender, to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) Any right it may have to require Administrative Agent or any Lender to proceed against Borrowers, proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrowers, or pursue any other remedy in Administrative Agent's or any Lender's power to pursue; (c) Any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrowers; (d) Any defense based on: (i) any legal disability of Borrowers, (ii) any release, discharge, modification, impairment or limitation of the liability of Borrowers to Administrative Agent or any Lender from any cause, whether consented to by Administrative Agent or any Lender or arising by operation of law or from any bankruptcy or other voluntary or involuntary proceeding, in or out of court, for the adjustment of debtor-creditor relationships ("INSOLVENCY PROCEEDING"), and (iii) any rejection or disaffirmance of the Indebtedness, or any part of it, or any security held for it, in any such Insolvency Proceeding; 3
(e) Any defense based on any action taken or omitted by Administrative Agent or any Lender in any Insolvency Proceeding involving Borrowers, including any election to have Administrative Agent's or that Lender's claim allowed as being secured, partially secured or unsecured, any extension of credit by Lender to Borrowers in any Insolvency Proceeding, and the taking and holding by Administrative Agent or any Lender of any security for any such extension of credit; (f) All presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness, and demands and notices of every kind except for any demand or notice by Administrative Agent or any Lender to each Guarantor expressly provided for in Section 1; (g) Any defense based on or arising out of any defense that Borrowers may have to the payment or performance of the Indebtedness or any part of it (other than indefeasible payment in full); and (h) Any defense based on or arising out of any action of Administrative Agent or any Lender described in Sections 3 or 4 above. 6. WAIVERS OF SUBROGATION AND OTHER RIGHTS. (a) During the existence of an Event of Default, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Collateral Documents, Administrative Agent or any Lender (subject to SECTION 8.02 of the Credit Agreement), without prior notice to or consent of any Guarantor, may elect to: (i) foreclose either judicially or nonjudicially against any real or personal property security it may hold for the Indebtedness, (ii) accept a transfer of any such security in lieu of foreclosure, (iii) compromise or adjust the Indebtedness or any part of it or make any other accommodation with Borrowers or Guarantors, or (iv) exercise any other remedy against Borrowers or any security. No such action by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall release or limit the liability of Guarantors, who shall remain liable under this Guaranty after the action, even if the effect of the action is to deprive Guarantors of any subrogation rights, rights of indemnity, or other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrowers for any sums paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether contractual or arising by operation of law or otherwise. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that under no circumstances shall it be deemed to have any right, title, interest or claim in or to any real or personal property to be held by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any third party after any foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure of any security for the Indebtedness. (b) Regardless of whether any Guarantor may have made any payments to Administrative Agent or any Lender, each Guarantor hereby waives: (i) all rights of subrogation, all rights of indemnity, and any other rights to collect reimbursement from Borrowers for any sums paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender, whether contractual or arising by operation of law (including the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor or similar statute) or otherwise, (ii) all rights to enforce any remedy that Lender may have against Borrowers, and (iii) all rights to participate in any security now or later 4
to be held by Administrative Agent or any Lender for the Indebtedness, in each case until the full and indefeasible payment and performance of all Indebtedness, and all obligations of the Guarantors hereunder. (c) Each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, even though that election of remedies may affect such Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the Borrowers by the operation of law or otherwise. In addition, each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that such Guarantor may have because the Borrowers' indebtedness is secured by real property. This means, among other things, that Administrative Agent and the Lenders may collect from any Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the Borrowers. 7. REVIVAL AND REINSTATEMENT. If Administrative Agent or any Lender is required to pay, return or restore to Borrowers or any other person any amounts previously paid on the Indebtedness because of any Insolvency Proceeding of Borrowers, any stop notice or any other reason, the obligations of Guarantors shall be reinstated and revived and the rights of Administrative Agent and such Lender shall continue with regard to such amounts, all as though they had never been paid. 8. INFORMATION REGARDING BORROWERS. Before signing this Guaranty, each Guarantor investigated the financial condition and business operations of Borrowers and such other matters as such Guarantor deemed appropriate to assure itself of Borrowers' ability to discharge their obligations under the Loan Documents. Each Guarantor assumes full responsibility for that due diligence, as well as for keeping informed of all matters that may affect Borrowers' ability to pay and perform their obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty to disclose to any Guarantor any information which such party may have or receive about Borrowers' financial condition, business operations, or any other circumstances bearing on their ability to perform. 9. SUBORDINATION. Any rights of Guarantors, whether now existing or later arising, to receive payment on account of any indebtedness (including interest) owed to any of them by Borrowers or any Guarantor thereof or to receive any payment from Borrowers or any such Guarantor other than those payments or distributions permitted under Sections 7.07 and 7.10 of the Credit Agreement shall at all times be subordinate as to lien and time of payment and in all other respects to the full and prior repayment of the Indebtedness. No Guarantor shall be entitled to enforce or receive payment of any sums hereby subordinated until the Indebtedness has been paid and performed in full and any such sums received in violation of this Guaranty shall be received by such Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. 10. FINANCIAL INFORMATION. Each Guarantor shall keep true and correct financial books and records, using generally accepted accounting principles which are applicable to the circumstances as of the date of determination, or such other accounting principles as the Requisite Lenders in their reasonable judgment may find acceptable from time to time. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and covenants to Administrative Agent and the Lenders that all financial information with respect to such Guarantor delivered or to be delivered to Administrative Agent and the Lenders by Borrowers with respect to such Guarantor under 5
Section 6.01 of the Credit Agreement is or shall be true and correct and fairly presents or will fairly present the financial position of such Guarantor for the applicable period in accordance with GAAP except as otherwise noted therein. Each Guarantor shall promptly provide Administrative Agent and the Lenders with any additional audited financial information that such Guarantor may obtain, and such other information concerning its affairs and properties as Administrative Agent or any Lender may reasonably request, including, without limitation, signed copies of any tax returns if requested by Administrative Agent or the Lenders. 11. GUARANTORS' REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that: (a) All financial statements delivered to Administrative Agent or the Lenders were or will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which are applicable to the circumstances as of the date of determination, or such other accounting principles as may be acceptable to the Requisite Lenders at the time of their preparation; (b) There has been no material adverse change in such Guarantor's financial condition since the dates of the statements most recently furnished to Administrative Agent and the Lenders; and (c) All representations and warranties given on behalf of or with respect to such Guarantor contained in SECTION 5 of the Credit Agreement and in any other Loan Document or certification made in connection with the Credit Agreement are true and correct in all material respects. 12. COVENANTS OF GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that it shall comply with and perform all covenants given on behalf of or with respect to such Guarantor (whether expressly or as a Subsidiary) contained in Sections 6 and 7 of the Credit Agreement and in all other Loan Documents. 13. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 14. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 15. AUTHORIZATION; NO VIOLATION. Each Guarantor is authorized to execute, deliver and perform under this Guaranty, which is a valid, binding, and enforceable obligation of such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally or by equitable principles related to enforcability. The execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty are not in violation of any applicable law, regulation or ordinance, or any order or ruling of any court or governmental agency applicable to such Guarantor. The Guaranty does not conflict with, or constitute a breach or default under, any agreement to which such Guarantor is a party. 16. ADDITIONAL AND INDEPENDENT OBLIGATIONS. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are in addition to its obligations under any future guaranties, each of which shall remain in full force and effect until it is expressly modified or released in a writing signed 6
by Administrative Agent and consented to by the Lenders. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty are independent of those of Borrowers on the Indebtedness. Subject to SECTION 8.02 of the Credit Agreement, Administrative Agent or the Lenders may bring a separate action, or commence a separate arbitration proceeding against each Guarantor without first proceeding against Borrowers, any other person or any security that Administrative Agent or any Lender may hold, and without pursuing any other remedy. None of Administrative Agent's or any Lender's rights under this Guaranty shall be exhausted by any action by Administrative Agent or any Lender until the Indebtedness has been paid and performed in full in cash. 17. NO WAIVER; CONSENTS; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. Each waiver by Administrative Agent or the Lenders must be in writing, and no waiver shall be construed as a continuing waiver. No waiver shall be implied from Administrative Agent's or any Lender's delay in exercising or failure to exercise any right or remedy against Borrowers, any Guarantor or any security. Consent by Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any act or omission by Borrowers or any Guarantor shall not be construed as a consent to any other or subsequent act or omission, or as a waiver of the requirement for Administrative Agent's or the Lenders' consent to be obtained in any future or other instance. All remedies of Administrative Agent and each Lender against Borrowers and any Guarantor are cumulative. 18. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 19. HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS. The terms of this Guaranty shall bind and benefit the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Guarantors; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Guarantor may assign this Guaranty, or assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Guaranty, without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent in each instance. Without notice to or the consent of Guarantors, Administrative Agent and any Lender may disclose any and all information in its possession concerning Guarantors, this Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty to any actual or prospective purchaser of any securities issued or to be issued by Administrative Agent or such Lender, and to any actual or prospective purchaser or assignee of any participation or other interest in the Indebtedness and this Guaranty; provided each recipient of such information agrees to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of Section 10.23 of the Credit Agreement for the benefit of the Borrower and the Guarantors. 20. NOTICES. (a) DELIVERY. All notices, requests and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, telegraphic, telex, facsimile transmission or cable communication) and mailed, telegraphed, telexed or delivered to the recipient's address specified on the signature pages hereof, or to such other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other party. (b) RECEIPT. All such notices and communications shall, when transmitted by overnight delivery, telegraphed, telecopied by facsimile, telexed or cabled, be effective when delivered for overnight delivery or to the telegraph company, transmitted by 7
telecopier, confirmed by telex answerback or delivered to the cable company, respectively, or if delivered, upon delivery. (c) RELIANCE. Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any person purporting to be a person authorized by Guarantors to give such notice, and neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability to any Guarantor or any other person on account of any action taken or not taken by Administrative Agent or such Lender in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The obligation of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by Lender to receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the receipt by Administrative Agent or a Lender of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms understood by Administrative Agent or such Lender to be contained in the telephonic or facsimile notice. 21. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. In this Guaranty, the word "Borrowers" includes both each named Borrower and any other person who at any time assumes or otherwise becomes primarily liable for all or any part of the obligations of the named Borrowers on the Indebtedness. The word "person" includes any individual, company, trust or other legal entity of any kind. If this Guaranty is executed by more than one person, the word "Guarantors" includes all such persons. The word "include(s)" means "include(s), without limitation," and the word "including" means "including, but not limited to." When the context and construction so require, all words used in the singular shall be deemed to have been used in the plural and vice versa. No listing of specific instances, items or matters in any way limits the scope or generality of any language of this Guaranty. All headings appearing in this Guaranty are for convenience only and shall be disregarded in construing this Guaranty. 22. GOVERNING LAW. This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 23. COSTS AND EXPENSES. If any lawsuit or arbitration is commenced which arises out of, or which relates to this Guaranty, the Loan Documents or the Indebtedness, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from each other party such sums as the court or arbitrator may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for services of in-house counsel) in the action or proceeding, in addition to costs and expenses otherwise allowed by law. In all other situations, including any Insolvency Proceeding, each Guarantor jointly and severally agrees to pay all of the Administrative Agent's and each Lender's costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for services of the Administrative Agent's and each Lender's in-house counsel) which may be incurred in any effort to collect or enforce the Indebtedness or any part of it or any term of this Guaranty. Without limiting any rights of the Administrative Agent or Lenders under the Credit Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts of any kind due and payable under this Guaranty (whether for principal, interest, and other costs under the Indebtedness, or for costs, fees, and expenses for which the Guarantors are directly responsible hereunder, or otherwise) shall accrue interest from the time the Administrative Agent or the Lenders make demand therefor hereunder until paid in full in cash to such Administrative Agent or the Lenders at the Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, PLUS 3%, except to the extent that any such amounts are then accruing interest under the Indebtedness, in which case such Base Rate PLUS 3% interest rate shall not be applied if 8
the effect would be to compound the interest to which such obligations are subject to under the Indebtedness. 24. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. 25. INTEGRATION; MODIFICATIONS. This Guaranty (a) integrates all the terms and conditions mentioned in or incidental to this Guaranty, (b) supersedes all oral negotiations and prior writings with respect to its subject matter, and (c) is intended by Guarantors, Administrative Agent and the Lenders as the final expression of the agreement with respect to the terms and conditions set forth in this Guaranty and as the complete and exclusive statement of the terms agreed to by each Guarantor, Administrative Agent and the Lenders. No representation, understanding, promise or condition shall be enforceable against any party hereto unless it is contained in this Guaranty. This Guaranty may not be modified except in a writing signed by both Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Lenders) and each Guarantor, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. No course of prior dealing, usage of trade, parol or extrinsic evidence of any nature shall be used to supplement, modify or vary any of the terms hereof. As between Administrative Agent and the Lenders only, nothing contained in this Guaranty shall alter the rights and obligations among Administrative Agent and the Lenders set forth in the Credit Agreement. 26. MISCELLANEOUS. The illegality or unenforceability of one or more provisions of this Guaranty shall not affect any other provision. Time is of the essence in the performance of this Guaranty by Guarantors. 27. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVERS. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof; (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such Guarantor at its address referred to in Section 20 or at such other address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto; (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and 9
(e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages. 28. RELEASES. At the request and sole expense of Borrowers, a Guarantor shall be released from its obligations hereunder in the event that all the capital Stock of such Guarantor shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement; provided that Borrowers shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent, at least ten Business Days prior to the date of the proposed release, a written request for release identifying the relevant Guarantor and the terms of the sale or other disposition in reasonable detail, including the price thereof and any expenses in connection therewith, together with a certification by Borrowers stating that such transaction is in compliance with the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 29. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GUARANTOR AND, BY ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN. 30. PROVISIONAL REMEDIES, SELF-HELP AND FORECLOSURE. No provision of this Guaranty shall limit the right of any party to exercise self-help remedies such as setoff, foreclosure against or sale of any real or personal property collateral or security.
