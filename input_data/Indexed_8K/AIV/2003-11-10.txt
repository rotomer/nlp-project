Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces Third Quarter 2003 Results
SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE:AIV) announced third quarter 2003 results including:
Net Income was $40.6 million, compared with $46.3 million in the third quarter 2002. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.15 on a diluted basis, compared with $0.26 in the same period last year, based on Net Income attributable to common stockholders.
Funds from Operations (diluted) (FFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary in Supplemental Information (the "Glossary")) were $86.4 million, or $0.80 per share, compared with $121.9 million, or $1.06 per share in the third quarter 2002.
Adjusted Funds from Operations (diluted) (AFFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary) were $71.3 million, or $0.66 per share, compared with $92.4 million, or $0.85 per share, in the third quarter 2002.
DILUTED PER SHARE RESULTS
Third quarter and first nine months 2003 results include non-cash charges of $5.5 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for the treatment of issuance costs associated with preferred share redemptions in the second and third quarters. This treatment of issuance costs is in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42 ("Topic D-42"). In addition, third quarter and first nine months results include non-cash impairment losses on real estate assets sold

or held for sale of $0.6 million and $8.6 million, respectively, that were historically added back in the calculation of FFO. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") indicated, as of October 1, 2003, that impairment losses should be subtracted in the calculation of FFO. These non-recurring, non-cash charges have been added back in the calculation of AFFO.
As a result, these non-cash charges reduced diluted FFO per share by $0.06 and $0.16 for the third quarter and first nine months, respectively.
PER SHARE IMPACT OF REPORTING CHANGES ON DILUTED FFO
Management Comments
Comments from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Terry Considine:
"Year to date, net operating income has increased by $42.4 million (7.3%) primarily due to a net increase in real estate investments. On a per share basis, FFO and AFFO are lower year to date, primarily because the apartment recession has resulted in lower rents and occupancies which, in turn, have driven higher marketing, turnover and Capital Replacement spending."
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
"It also bears noting, year to date, that transaction income is substantially lower, whether from Aimco Capital development and equity placement fees, or from accretion, net of provisions relating to Aimco's large portfolio of Notes Receivable."
"Another burden on current period results is an increased level of G&A spending for automation as well as high costs of compliance with increasing and changing government and accounting requirements."
"It is encouraging that the decline in revenue as compared to the prior year abated during the quarter but it is premature to know if this improvement will be sustained."
"Today's release also introduces more detailed reporting allocating Aimco financial results among its Core, Non-core, and Aimco Capital portfolios."
Dividends on Common Stock
The Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, payable on November 28, 2003 to stockholders of record on November 20, 2003. The Board of Directors reduced the quarterly cash dividend from $0.82 to $0.60 to align the amount with Aimco's current level of profitability. The dividend represents 91% of diluted AFFO and 70% of diluted FFO (before deducting non-cash, redemption related preferred stock issuance costs under Topic D-42 totaling $0.05 per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and a 6.6% yield based on the $36.23 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on November 5, 2003.
"Same Store" Results
"SAME STORE" RESULTS The "Same Store" portfolio includes 589 communities with a total of 164,578 apartment units in which Aimco has a weighted average ownership of 82.5% (see Supplemental Schedule IX). Revenue from the "Same Store" portfolio was $284.8 million compared with $288.7 million in the third quarter 2002. The decrease in revenue of $3.9 million, or 1.3%, is due primarily to (i) a decline in occupancy by 50 basis points to 93.0%, and (ii) lower rents, as the average "Same Store" rent declined by 1.4%, from $712 to $702 per apartment, as a result of competitive leasing environments in certain markets, particularly Denver, Texas and parts of the Midwest. "Same Store"
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
expenses of $118.8 million increased by $9.0 million, or 8.2%, compared with the third quarter 2002. Increased expenses were primarily due to: (i) $3.0 million in expenses related to increasing occupancy, including marketing, turnover, and administrative; (ii) $2.9 million in higher repairs and maintenance and landscaping services, in support of efforts to improve the physical appearance and condition of properties; and (iii) $1.5 million in higher utility expenses due to higher natural gas and water prices. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income was $166.0 million for the third quarter 2003, down 7.2% from the third quarter 2002.
SAME STORE OPERATING RESULTS
Comparing "Same Store" results on a sequential basis, Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio realized a $0.9 million increase in Net Rental Income (as defined in the Glossary) in the third quarter compared with the second quarter driven by a 40 basis point increase in average occupancy from 92.6% to 93.0%. Total revenue increased $1.9 million. Expenses increased $5.3 million due primarily to (i) a $1.9 million increase in expenses related to increasing occupancy (marketing, turnover and administrative); (ii) $0.8 million increase in expenses related to improving the physical appearance of properties; (iii) $1.1 million increase for increased personnel expenses; and (iv) a $1.5 million increase in property taxes. Net Operating Income decreased $3.4 million, or 2.0%, on a sequential basis. During the quarter, the "Same Store" portfolio was reduced by 19 properties or 4,778 units due to property sales.
For the third quarter 2003, "Same Store" resident turnover was 16%, compared with 17% in the third quarter 2002.
"Same Store" results reflect the performance of conventional communities in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions.
Aimco's "Same Store" results measure Aimco's effective ownership in "Same Store" communities and include both Aimco's ownership interest in unconsolidated "Same Store" properties and subtract the minority interest share of consolidated properties (see reconciliation on Supplemental Schedule VIII). In keeping with this definition, the "Same Store" portfolio accounted for 78.1% of Real Estate Free Cash Flow (Free Cash Flow ("FCF") is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary and presented and reconciled to GAAP income on Supplemental Schedule II).
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS Capital Replacements (as defined in the Glossary) were $21.0 million and Capital Enhancements (as defined in the Glossary) were $0.2 million in the quarter, which totals are deducted in calculating AFFO. These totals compare with $24.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in the third quarter 2002. Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending together are expected to total approximately $560 per unit for the full year 2003. Beginning in the second quarter 2003, capital expenditures made for properties sold, held for sale or identified to be sold within one year are classified as Disposition Capital Expenditures (as defined in the Glossary). Beginning in the third quarter 2003, Aimco began to include in Disposition Capital Expenditures certain Affordable properties that are expected to be sold upon satisfaction of regulatory requirements. Disposition Capital Expenditures totaled $10.6 million in the quarter.

based on 157,000 units in third quarter 2003, representing Aimco's weighted average ownership in conventional and affordable properties.
Reporting by Business Component
Starting in the third quarter 2003, Aimco has introduced business component reporting for Aimco Conventional operations and Aimco Capital with the addition of Supplemental Schedules XVI through XXVIII. These schedules present select, non-GAAP information related to income statement, free cash flow, balance sheet and operating measures. They are intended to present results of Aimco's distinct operating portfolios. Aimco's strategy is to expand and upgrade its Core real estate portfolio and, over time, to sell its Non-core and Affordable portfolios reinvesting the proceeds in acquisitions for the Core portfolio and in debt reduction or share repurchases. Core properties are those properties that are located in selected markets and which Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term. Non-core properties are located in other markets or in less favored locations within the selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for an intermediate term. Affordable properties are typically those which have rent subsidies provided by HUD and other government agencies.
CONVENTIONAL OPERATIONS Conventional real estate operations include Aimco's diversified portfolio of market-rate apartment communities and associated property management and other income. During the third quarter, conventional real estate operations generated FCF of $164.7 million from 669 properties with 187,000 units and an average 80% ownership. Conventional real estate assets have been further allocated between Core and Non-core, with performance results presented on Schedules XXII through XXVIII. "Same Store" Core properties include 331 communities with 102,971 units and accounted for 75% of real estate FCF "Same Store" Non-
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
core properties include 258 communities with 61,607 units and accounted for 25% of real estate FCF. Conventional operations also generated Free Cash Flow from property management and other fees (associated with asset management, construction management, refinancing, dispositions, development and other services to affiliated partnerships), net of expenses and insurance losses, of $(0.4) million.
AIMCO CAPITAL Aimco Capital was established in 2002 to organize affordable property operations and asset management under a single management team dedicated to this sector. The management of affordable housing requires specialized property management, accounting and legal expertise to comply with the regulatory framework that affects affordable properties. Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of affordable properties in the United States. During the third quarter 2003, Affordable property operations included 495 properties with 59,064 units. Aimco has an average 38% ownership in its Affordable properties. Occupancy and average rents in the affordable sector were stable and averaged 95.2% and $645, respectively in the third quarter, consistent with the second quarter 2003.
Aimco Capital also generates income from asset management (from the above holdings as well as two other large portfolios that are asset managed only), property management, and transactional activity including dispositions, tax credit redevelopment and refinancings. Aimco Capital has completed 57 transactions year-to-date. Although, negotiated rent increases are reflected in increased affordable revenue, other fees and transactions are recorded as investment management income. During the third quarter 2003, Aimco Capital generated FCF of $18.1 million from property operations and asset management and transaction activity.
Additional Income Information
INTEREST INCOME FROM GENERAL PARTNER LOANS Interest and Other Income was $5.1 million, a decrease of $8.1 million from the third quarter of 2002, primarily due to lower outstanding balances on general partner notes and also lower transactional income.
Notes receivable primarily from affiliated partnerships were $184.3 million ($253.0 million face value) at quarter-end versus $247.5 million ($337.4 million face value) at September 30, 2002, a reduction of $63.2 million, or 26%, due primarily to collections of the notes
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
receivable and GAAP required eliminations on newly consolidated partnerships. Aimco recognized in the third quarter 2003 total transactional income of $0.05 million and made no provisions for loan losses, compared with $3.8 million in transactional income and $1.7 million of provisions in the third quarter 2002.
INTEREST EXPENSE Consolidated interest expense was $95.2 million for the quarter, an increase of $18.4 million when compared with $76.8 million in the third quarter 2002. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of an increase in debt associated with newly consolidated and acquired properties.
G&A General and Administrative expenses for the quarter were $7.6 million, up from $4.4 million in the third quarter 2002. The $3.2 million increase is primarily due to: (i) $1.4 million for increased employee compensation and benefits; and (ii) $1.7 million for increased professional fees for compliance with increasing and changing government and accounting requirements.
GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS AND INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate of $1.5 million and Income from Discontinued Operations of $27.5 million in third quarter 2003 compared with a loss of $7.9 million and income of $4.3 million, respectively, in the third quarter 2002. Income from Discontinued Operations in the third quarter 2003 included a net gain on sales of $22.9 million, somewhat offset by impairment losses on real estate assets sold or held for sale and income taxes on dispositions.
SUMMARY OF THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE Diluted EPS of $0.15 was higher than the projected range of ($0.08) to ($0.04) due primarily to the Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate of $22.9 million, which is recorded in Discontinued Operations.
Diluted FFO per share of $0.80 was below Aimco estimates provided August 13, 2003. Comparing diluted FFO on a sequential basis, per share diluted FFO decreased $0.06 from the $0.86 (after required adjustments) earned in the second quarter due to:

Transaction and Redevelopment Activity
ACQUISITIONS During the third quarter, Aimco purchased one property with 58 apartment units and 12 commercial spaces in five, contiguous, five-story buildings that occupy a full block-front on the east side of Columbus Avenue from 68 to 69 Streets in Manhattan. Aimco funded the $37.6 million purchase through a new $20 million loan and 1031 proceeds from the sale of Non-core properties. Year-to-date Aimco has purchased three properties for $105.6 million. During the third quarter, Aimco also purchased for an aggregate of $0.4 million limited and general partnership interests in 16 partnerships that own 50 properties. Year to date 2003, Aimco has purchased for an aggregate of $10.5 million limited and general partnership interests in 122 partnerships that own 325 properties.

Park La Brea Phase II (The Palazzo at Park La Brea), a development property in the mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles, is on track for its scheduled purchase at year-end. In connection with Aimco's March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties Inc., Aimco agreed to purchase the 521-unit property, which has average rents per unit of more than $2,500 per month, for approximately $163 million after its attainment of 60% occupancy.
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
DISPOSITIONS Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet long-term investment criteria. Aimco considers these properties Non-core and seeks to sell them over the intermediate term.
During the third quarter, Aimco sold 34 properties including 7,231 apartment units for $263 million in gross proceeds, generating net cash proceeds to Aimco of $89 million after payment of mortgage debt and limited partner interests. Of the properties sold, 26 were conventional and eight were affordable. Year-to-date, Aimco has sold 74 properties including 17,351 apartment units for $638 million in gross proceeds. See the chart below for additional information on disposition activity. The FCF Yield is calculated as the FCF earned by the properties during the 12 months prior to their sale divided by the sales price. FCF includes a $525 per unit deduction for Capital Replacements and is before debt service.
THIRD QUARTER PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY
FIRST NINE MONTHS 2003 PROPERTY SALES ACTIVITY
Aimco is currently marketing for sale 125 conventional properties (approximately 26,000 units) and 180 affordable properties (approximately 20,000 units). Aimco anticipates gross sales proceeds of approximately $250 to $300 million through the remainder of 2003. Aimco expects that its share of cash from these dispositions, net of limited partner interests and
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
after repayment of mortgage debt, will be approximately $70 to $80 million. Under SFAS 144, these properties being marketed for sale are not all classified as assets held for sale as they do not meet specified criteria.
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY At quarter-end, Aimco had ten conventional properties with 5,327 units, and two affordable properties with 467 units, being redeveloped. Redevelopment expenditures in the quarter for the ten conventional properties were $23.3 million, of which Aimco's share was $15.9 million. The ten projects include three new projects: Cherry Creek Gardens located in Denver, Colorado; Westlake Arms located in Indianapolis, Indiana; and Chimney Hill, located in Marietta, Georgia, which is a 326-unit ground up development project that is being managed by Casden Development Company, LLC. Redevelopment expenditures for these ten conventional projects are expected to total $428.0 million, of which approximately $51.7 million remains to be spent. Aimco's share of this total redevelopment spending is $324.0 million, of which approximately $32.9 million remains to be spent.
Aimco's largest redevelopment project is Flamingo South Beach with 1,685 apartments located in Miami Beach, Florida. During the quarter, 237 additional units were completed for a total of 1,298 completed units and 387 units under redevelopment. At quarter-end, occupied and pre-leased units totaled 942.
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
FINANCING ACTIVITY During the third quarter, Aimco closed 19 mortgage loans generating $89.2 million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 4.39%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners totaling $60.7 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $28.5 million.
Apartment Investment and Management Company Third Quarter 2003
At quarter-end, Aimco's consolidated mortgage debt was $5,707 million. Aimco's pro rata share of mortgage debt (including total consolidated debt, less the minority interest portion plus Aimco's share of unconsolidated debt) was $5,536 million at quarter-end (see Supplemental Schedule V for detail). Mortgage debt had a weighted average maturity of 15 years and weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, down from 6.5% at year-end 2002; 82% was fixed rate debt and 18% was floating rate debt. Seventy-four percent of the floating rate mortgage debt was tax-exempt mortgage debt.
In addition to mortgage debt, at quarter end, Aimco had short-term debt of $514 million, including a $250 million term loan, $160 million drawn on the revolving credit facility, and $104 remaining on the term loan entered into in connection with the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties Inc. Total debt increased by $201 million during the quarter due primarily to: (i) reclassification as debt of mandatorily redeemable securities (primarily the Class S Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock) due to the adoption of SFAS 150; (ii) acquisition of a partnership interest in Lincoln Place in Southern California and the Manhattan property; (iii) and funding the NAPICO litigation settlement; all partially offset by reduced mortgage debt due to property sales.

These redemptions were completed for cash on August 18, 2003.
LIQUIDITY During the quarter Aimco drew $160 million on its revolving credit facility, leaving $285 million in available funds.
Subsequent to quarter-end, Aimco completed modifications of its credit facility and term loans. Modifications included: (i) reduction of the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.50:1 to 1.40:1; (ii) reduction of the minimum interest coverage ratio from 2.25:1 to 2.00:1; (iii) increasing to 90% the percentage of FFO permitted to be distributed, based on trailing 12-months; and (iv) permitting the exclusion of redemption related preferred stock issuance costs (under Topic D-42) from interest expense and dividends when calculating coverage ratios. In conjunction with the modifications and based on current coverage ratios, the applicable margin on the revolving credit facility LIBOR-based loans increased from 2.65% to 2.85% and base rate loan margins increased from 1.15% to 1.35%.

GLOSSARY
GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less both Capital Replacement expenditures and Capital Enhancement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and impairment losses. Similar to FFO, AFFO captures real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. AFFO also reflects that Capital Replacements are necessary to maintain, and Capital Enhancements are made to improve, the associated real estate assets.
Please see Supplemental Schedules I and II for AFFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS (CR AND CE): CR and CE are components of total capital expenditures. CR expenditures are required to maintain Aimco's assets and CE expenditures are made to improve Aimco's assets by adding a new feature or revenue source.
CR and CE spending are components of capital expenditures denoted as line items in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
DISPOSITION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: Disposition Capital Expenditures are capital expenditures made on properties sold, held for sale or identified as to be sold within one year. Disposition capital expenditures are incurred to support the sale of these properties and are not part of Aimco's ongoing Capital Replacements. In the third quarter 2003, Aimco included capital expenditures made for affordable properties that are expected to be sold upon completion of regulatory requirements. These expenditures are included in this classification as Aimco is limited in the amount of proceeds that it can receive in distribution from the properties' operations, and amounts in excess must be reinvested in the property or forfeited to the applicable government agency. Aimco expects to recover these expenditures upon sale of the property. Prior to establishing this category of capital expenditures, these expenditures were accounted for as Capital Replacements and deducted in calculating
AFFO. Aimco will review this allocation each quarter and will re-allocate to Capital Replacements any items for those properties not sold or no longer identified as to be sold.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF, as defined by Aimco, is net operating income from real estate minus Capital Replacement spending required to maintain, and Capital Enhancement spending made to improve, the related assets. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the Investment Management Business, Interest and Other Income, General and Administrative expenses, Provision for losses on notes receivable and other expenses incurred by Aimco. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. Because Aimco has substantial unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows as related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
Please see Supplemental Schedule II for FCF data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, dispositions of depreciable real estate property, dispositions of real estate from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. Aimco calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for the minority interest in Aimco's operating partnership (AIMCO Properties, L.P.), plus amortization of intangibles and distributions to minority partners in excess of income. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends/distributions on preferred stock/partnership units (net of preferred dividends/distributions relating to convertible securities the conversion of which is dilutive to FFO) and adding back the interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities the conversion of which is dilutive to FFO. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
Please see Supplemental Schedules I and II for FFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
NET RENTAL INCOME (NRI): NRI is an operating measure calculated as the product of the number of rental units in Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio multiplied by occupancy multiplied by average effective rent per unit. NRI does not reflect income from all sources and does not reflect operating expenses.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe conventional properties in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions.
Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership.
Please see Supplemental Schedules VIII through XIII for Same Store data reconciled to Income from Property Operations as determined in accordance with GAAP.
UNCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS: Unconsolidated balance sheet items such as Aimco's share of unconsolidated cash, unconsolidated restricted cash, unconsolidated accounts receivable, unconsolidated current liabilities and unconsolidated debt are components of Balance Sheet line items on the GAAP Financial Statements that are useful in understanding Aimco's proportionate share of assets and liabilities, prior to consolidation in GAAP financial statements.
Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited)
[a]    In second quarter 2002, Aimco began deducting, on a prospective basis, Capital Enhancements, as well as Capital Replacements, to calculate Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Funds From Operations.
[b]    On October 1, 2003, NAREIT clarified its definition of Funds From Operations (FFO) to include impairment losses, which previously had been added back to calculate FFO. Although Aimco's presentation conforms with the NAREIT definition, Aimco considers such approach to be inconsistent with the treatment of gains on dispositions of real estate, which are not included in the calculation of FFO. In the three months ended September 30, 2003, and effective for all prior periods presented, Aimco no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with this clarification. As a result, FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2003 includes impairment losses of $0.6 million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, includes an adjustment of $7.9 million to reflect this change. FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002 includes an adjustment of $3.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively, to reflect this change. As a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, Aimco has complied with the clarification of including redemption related preferred stock issuance costs in the three months ended September 30, 2003, and effective for all prior periods presented, in FFO. Therefore, FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2003 includes issuance costs of $5.5 million and FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 includes an adjustment of $2.2 million to reflect this change.

Capital Expenditures As of September 30, 2003 (in thousands) (unaudited)
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Aimco spent a total of $67.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, for Capital Replacements (expenditures required to maintain the related asset) and Capital Enhancements (expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property). These amounts represent Aimco's share of the total spending on both consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships.
The table below details Aimco's actual spending based on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 157,000 units) for the nine months ended September 30, 2003:
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Aimco spent a total of $18.6 million for Initial Capital Expenditures or "ICE", which are expenditures at a property that have been identified at the time the property is acquired, as expenditures to be incurred within a specified period of time of the acquisition, typically one year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Aimco spent $16.0 million for Disposition Capital Expenditures, which reports those capital expenditures made on properties sold, held for sale, or identified as to be sold within one year. In third quarter 2003, Aimco began to include in Disposition Capital Expenditures capital expenditures on certain of Aimco's affordable properties that are expected to be sold upon completion of regulatory requirements. Although the sales will not necessarily occur within a year period, Aimco believes that capital expenditures on such properties are appropriately included in Disposition Capital Expenditures because of the regulatory framework under which these properties are financed or operated. Specifically, Aimco is limited in the amount of proceeds that it is permitted to receive in distribution from the properties' operations. Amounts in excess of that limitation must be reinvested in the property or forfeited to the applicable government agency. Aimco typically elects to spend amounts in excess of the distribution limit on property improvements, and Aimco expects that upon a sale of the property that the expenditures will be recovered. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, Aimco spent a total of $66.3 million for redevelopment, which are expenditures that substantially upgrade the related property.
Aimco's share of the total spending on both consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships are as follows (in millions):
The expenditures were funded by net cash provided by operating activities, working capital reserves and borrowings under Aimco's credit facility.

REPORTING BY BUSINESS COMPONENT
INTRODUCTION    Starting in the third quarter 2003, Aimco is providing business component reporting for Aimco Conventional operations and Aimco Capital with the addition of Supplemental Schedules XVI through XXVIII. These schedules present select, non-GAAP information related to income statement, free cash flow, balance sheet and operating measures. The Conventional and Aimco Capital business components are differentiated primarily in that Conventional rents are set in the market and paid by the consumer and Affordable rents, i.e., those earned by properties operated by Aimco Capital, are set pursuant to government regulations and paid, in large part, by the government.
CONVENTIONAL    The Conventional property portfolio includes both high-rise and garden style properties offering a wide range of rents and located to provide Aimco geographic diversification in its portfolio. The principal activities of Conventional operations are:
1.
ownership, both outright and in partnership, on a long-term basis of properties whose locations are regarded as enduring. Conventional property operations are concentrated in 45 markets, which Aimco describes as its "Selected" markets (the "Core Portfolio");
2.
ownership, both outright and in partnership, of properties that Aimco intends to hold for an intermediate term and that are located outside the Selected markets or which are located in less favored locations within the Selected markets (the "Non-core Portfolio");
3.
redevelopment of conventional properties, generally within the Core Portfolio.
AIMCO CAPITAL    Aimco Capital oversees the Affordable property operations, the management of which requires specialized accounting and legal expertise to comply with the regulatory framework that affects Affordable property ownership and management. The principal activities of Aimco Capital operations are:
1.
ownership, both outright and in partnership, of approximately 500 properties including 60,000 units located in 47 states;
2.
asset management of the above as well as two other large portfolios that are asset managed only which include an additional 400 properties with 40,000 units;
3.
oversight of related transactional activity that can generate fees for asset management, disposition activity, refinancing, syndication of tax credits and redevelopment.
The Conventional and Aimco Capital business components have different operating managements and share corporate services such as accounting, purchasing, debt placement, legal, human resources, information technology and partner relations.
