Exhibit 99.1
AIMCO 4th Quarter 2003
Denver, ColoradoFebruary 12, 2004
Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces Fourth Quarter 2003 Results
SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS    Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE:AIV) announced fourth quarter 2003 results including:
Net Income was $37.2 million, compared with $6.6 million in the fourth quarter 2002. Earnings (loss) per share (EPS) were $0.19 on a diluted basis, compared with $(0.17) in the same period last year, based on Net Income (loss) attributable to common stockholders.
Funds from Operations (diluted) (FFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary in Supplemental Information (the "Glossary")) were $67.9 million, or $0.72 per share compared with $101.6 million, or $1.01 per share, in the fourth quarter 2002. These FFO results were calculated in accordance with the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). As a result, fourth quarter 2003 FFO was reduced by $4.6 million for impairment charges on real estate assets sold or held for sale. Excluding these impairment charges, fourth quarter 2003 FFO would have been $72.8 million, or $0.76 per share, within Aimco guidance and meeting First Call consensus.
Adjusted Funds from Operations (diluted) (AFFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary) were $56.0 million, or $0.58 per share, within Aimco guidance, compared with $80.8 million, or $0.83 per share, in the fourth quarter 2002.

Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 2
Full year 2003 FFO results include charges of $7.6 million in issuance costs associated with preferred share redemptions in the second and third quarters. Aimco gave effect to these issuance costs in accordance with the SEC's July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42 ("Topic D-42"). In addition, fourth quarter and full year 2003 results include impairment losses on real estate assets sold or held for sale of $4.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively, that Aimco historically added back in its calculation of FFO.
As a result, these charges reduced FFO (diluted) per share by $4.6 million and $20.7 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2003, respectively. These charges have been added back in the calculation of AFFO.

Management Comments
Comments from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Terry Considine:
"Apartment markets remain quite weak. Some of this weakness is seasonal; some reflects increasing competition from new supply, single family as well as multi-family; and some reflects the continued slow pace of recovery in national employment. Aimco remains focused on improving operations, by example, the recent promotion of Jeff Adler to lead Property Operations; strengthening financial control, by example, the recent recruitment of Tom Herzog from GE Real Estate to serve as Chief Accounting Officer; and by active portfolio management, selling weaker properties in weaker
Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 3
markets to invest in such better assets as The Palazzo, in the mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles."
Dividends on Common Stock
As announced on January 30, 2004, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, payable on February 27, 2004 to stockholders of record on February 20, 2004. The dividend represents 103% of AFFO (diluted) and 83% of FFO (diluted), on a per share basis, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 and a 7.0% annualized yield based on the $34.42 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on January 29, 2004.
"Same Store" Results
"SAME STORE" RESULTS    For the fourth quarter 2003, the "Same Store" portfolio included 580 communities with a total of 163,415 apartment units in which Aimco has a weighted average ownership of 84.2% (see Supplemental Schedule IX). Fourth quarter 2003 revenue from the "Same Store" portfolio was $290.3 million compared with $295.2 million in the fourth quarter 2002. While the "Same Store" portfolio experienced a 0.5 percentage point increase in occupancy from 91.3% in the fourth quarter 2002 to 91.8% in the fourth quarter 2003, revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 1.7%, primarily due to lower average rents per unit. Rental rates declined by 2.2%, from $735 to $719 per apartment. California and the Northeast enjoyed increased revenue by 2.6% and 1.2%, respectively, but these increases were more than offset by revenue declines in other regions. Texas and the West each had a 5.3% decline in revenue while the Midwest experienced a 4.6% decline. "Same Store" expenses of $120.3 million increased by $10.0 million, or 9.0%, compared with the fourth quarter 2002. Increased expenses were primarily due to: (i) $4.7 million in expenses related to increasing occupancy, including marketing and turnover; (ii) $3.5 million in higher repairs and maintenance, in support of efforts to improve the physical condition of properties; and (iii) $1.5 million in higher utility expenses due to higher rates for natural gas and water. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income was $170.0 million for the fourth quarter 2003, down 8.1% from the fourth quarter 2002.
Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 4
SAME STORE OPERATING RESULTS
Comparing "Same Store" results on a sequential basis, Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio realized a $4.5 million decrease in Net Rental Income (as defined in the Glossary) in the fourth quarter 2003 compared with the third quarter 2003, driven by a 1.2 percentage point decline in average occupancy from 93.0% to 91.8% and a $2 decline in average rent per unit. Total revenue declined $6.0 million. Expenses decreased $5.0 million due primarily to lower turnover and landscaping costs totaling $2.2 million and lower insurance expense. Net Operating Income decreased $1.0 million, or 0.6%, on a sequential basis. During the fourth quarter 2003, the "Same Store" portfolio was reduced by nine properties, or 1,163 units, due to property sales.
Comparing full year "Same Store" results, 2003 revenue of $1,038.9 million was down $36.9 million, or 3.4%, compared with 2002. "Same Store" expenses of $441.2 million were up $39.6 million, or 9.9%, and "Same Store" Net Operating Income of $597.8 million was down $76.5 million, or 11.3%.
For the fourth quarter 2003, "Same Store" resident turnover was 11%, down from 12% in the fourth quarter 2002.
"Same Store" results reflect the performance of conventional communities in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and which have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions.
Aimco's "Same Store" results measure Aimco's effective ownership in "Same Store" communities and include both Aimco's ownership interest in unconsolidated "Same Store" properties and subtract the minority partners' share of consolidated properties (see reconciliation on Supplemental Schedule VIII). In keeping with this definition, the "Same
Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 5
Store" portfolio accounted for 95.8% of Conventional Real Estate Free Cash Flow. (Free Cash Flow ("FCF") is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary and presented and reconciled to GAAP income on Supplemental Schedule II.)
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS    Capital Replacements (as defined in the Glossary) were $18.8 million and Capital Enhancements (as defined in the Glossary) were $0.2 million in the fourth quarter 2003, which totals are deducted in calculating AFFO. These totals compare with $21.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter 2002. Capital Replacement and Capital Enhancement spending together totaled $580 per unit for the full year 2003.

Reporting by Business Component
Starting in the third quarter 2003, Aimco introduced business component reporting for Aimco Conventional operations and Aimco Capital with the addition of Supplemental Schedules XVI through XXVIII. These schedules present selected non-GAAP information related to income statement, free cash flow, balance sheet and operating measures. They are intended to present results of Aimco's distinct operating portfolios. Aimco's strategy is to expand and upgrade its Core real estate portfolio and, over time, to sell its Non-Core and to reduce its Affordable portfolios and to reinvest the proceeds in acquisitions for the Core portfolio and in debt reduction or share repurchases. Core properties are those properties that are located in selected markets and which Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term. Non-Core properties are located in other markets or in less favored locations within the selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for an intermediate term. Affordable properties are typically those which have rent subsidies provided by HUD and other government agencies.
CONVENTIONAL OPERATIONS    Conventional real estate operations include Aimco's diversified portfolio of market-rate apartment communities and associated property management and other income. During the fourth quarter 2003, conventional real estate operations generated FCF of $154.9 million from 628 properties with 177,318 units and an average Aimco ownership of 81%. Conventional real estate assets are separated between Core and Non-Core, with performance results presented on Supplemental Schedules XXII through XXVIII. Core properties include 367 communities with 115,158 units and accounted for 76% of real estate FCF. Non-Core properties include 261 communities with 62,160 units and accounted for 24% of real estate FCF.
Comparing "Same Store" results for Core and Non-Core properties for the fourth quarter 2003 with the fourth quarter 2002, "Same Store" Core properties had a 1.4% decline in revenue, a 10.3% increase in expenses and a 7.7% decline in NOI. Non-core properties had a 2.5% decline in revenue, a 6.1% increase in expenses and a 9.2% decline in NOI. Sequentially, "Same Store" Core properties had a 1.8% decline in revenue, a 3.0% reduction in expenses and a 1.1% decline in NOI. Non-core properties had a 2.5% decline in revenue, a 6.1% reduction in expenses and a 1.1% increase in NOI.
Conventional operations generated Free Cash Flow from property management and other fees (associated with asset management, construction management, refinancing,
Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 7
dispositions, development and other services to affiliated partnerships), net of expenses and insurance losses, of ($3.7) million.
AIMCO CAPITAL    Aimco Capital was established in 2002 to organize affordable property operations and asset management under a single management team dedicated to this sector. The management of affordable housing requires specialized property management, accounting and legal expertise to comply with the regulatory framework that affects affordable properties. Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of affordable properties in the United States. During the fourth quarter 2003, Affordable property operations included 488 properties with 58,598 units. Aimco has an average 37% ownership in its affordable properties. Occupancy and average rents in the affordable sector were stable and averaged 95.1% and $645, respectively, in the fourth quarter 2003, consistent with the third quarter 2003.
Aimco Capital also generates income from asset management (of the above holdings as well as two other large portfolios that are asset-managed only), property management, and transactional activity including dispositions, tax credit redevelopment and refinancings. During the fourth quarter 2003, Aimco Capital generated FCF of $19.9 million from property operations, asset management and transactions. Of that amount, transactions totaled $6.0 million.
Additional Income Information
INTEREST INCOME FROM GENERAL PARTNER LOANS    Interest and Other Income was $6.7 million for the fourth quarter and $25.0 million for the full year, a decrease of $14.5 million and $52.3 million, respectively, compared with 2002, primarily due to lower transactional income (accretion).
Notes receivable primarily from affiliated partnerships were $206.2 million ($268.3 million face value) at December 31, 2003 versus $169.2 million ($252.8 million face value) at December 31, 2002, an increase of $37.0 million, or 22%, due to increased draws, net of payments, on existing agreements. Aimco recognized transactional income (accretion) of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter 2003 and $3.3 million for the full year 2003 compared with $17.5 million and $44.5 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter and full year 2002. Transactional income (accretion) was somewhat offset by the provisions for loan losses of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter 2003 and $2.2 million for the full year 2003, compared with
Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 8
$4.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively, recognized in the fourth quarter and full year 2002.
INTEREST EXPENSE    Consolidated interest expense was $94.7 million for the fourth quarter 2003, an increase of $0.2 million when compared with $94.5 million in the fourth quarter 2002. Consolidated interest expense was $372.7 million for the full year 2003, up $48.3 million from the full year 2002. The increase in interest expense is primarily a result of an increase in debt associated with newly consolidated and acquired properties.
G&A    General and Administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 2003 were $9.3 million, up $1.3 million from the fourth quarter 2002 due to compensation expenses and legal costs.
GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS    Aimco's active property disposition program in 2003 resulted in total (including gains recognized from sales of unconsolidated properties and from discontinued operations) Gains on Dispositions of Real Estate, net of impairments and related taxes, of $23.8 million for the fourth quarter and $79.8 million for the full year 2003, compared with losses of $28.8 million and $39.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2002, respectively. Gains on Dispositions of Real Estate are determined using the carrying amount of the properties sold, which included cumulative disposition capital expenditures of $1.3 million for properties sold in the fourth quarter and $4.3 million for properties sold during the year.
Transaction and Redevelopment Activity
ACQUISITIONS    During the fourth quarter, Aimco purchased a 357-unit luxury apartment property located on the waterfront in downtown Miami, Florida. Aimco purchased the high-rise building for $57.5 million, which was funded through the assumption of $45.0 million in property debt, issuance of 88,792 common units in Aimco's operating partnership at $39.50 per unit, and the remainder in cash. For the full year 2003, Aimco purchased five properties for $163.1 million. During the fourth quarter 2003, Aimco also purchased for an aggregate of $16.0 million limited and general partnership interests in 102 partnerships that own 358 properties. For the full year 2003, Aimco purchased, for an aggregate of $26.6 million, limited and general partnership interests in 166 partnerships that own 441 properties.
Subsequent to year-end, Aimco acquired The Palazzo at Park La Brea, a 521-unit luxury apartment property located in the mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles for $162.9 million.
Apartment Investment and Management Company Fourth Quarter 2003Page 9
DISPOSITIONS    Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria. Aimco considers these properties Non-Core and seeks to sell them over the intermediate term.
During the fourth quarter 2003, Aimco sold 36 properties with 7,966 apartment units for $299 million in gross proceeds, generating net cash proceeds to Aimco of $93 million after payment of mortgage debt, limited partner interests and transaction costs. Of the properties sold, 22 were conventional and 14 were affordable. For the full year 2003, Aimco sold 110 properties with 25,317 apartment units for $939 million in gross proceeds, generating net cash proceeds to Aimco of $309 million after payment of mortgage debt, limited partner interests and transaction costs. See the chart below for additional information on disposition activity. Net sales proceeds are calculated after transaction costs. The FCF Yield is calculated as the FCF earned by the properties during the 12 months prior to their sale divided by the sales price. FCF includes a $525 per unit deduction for Capital Replacements and is before debt service.

Redevelopment expenditures in the quarter for the nine conventional properties were $18.3 million, of which Aimco's share was $14.2 million. Redevelopment expenditures for these nine conventional projects are expected to total $396.2 million, of which approximately $48.7 million remains to be spent. Aimco's share of the total redevelopment spending is $289.8 million, of which approximately $31.6 million remains to be spent.
Aimco's largest redevelopment project is Flamingo South Beach with 1,687 apartments located in Miami Beach, Florida.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity
FINANCING ACTIVITY    As previously announced on January 5, 2004, Aimco entered into an equity financing transaction with GE Real Estate in the form of a property joint venture. At year-end, the joint venture owned 33 properties in nine markets with a total of 9,543 units. The joint venture is owned by GE Real Estate and Aimco, with a promote structure that limits GE Real Estate's leveraged return above 11%. Aimco contributed the properties to the joint venture and received approximately $107 million in cash proceeds at closing, which Aimco plans to use to redeem preferred stock, to fund acquisitions of limited partner interests, and for general corporate purposes.
During the fourth quarter 2003, Aimco closed 19 mortgage loans generating $129.6 million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of 3.98%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners totaling $97.6 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $32.0 million.

GLOSSARY
        GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
        ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less both Capital Replacement expenditures and Capital Enhancement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco operating partnership's share (AIMCO Properties, L.P.). Similar to FFO, AFFO captures real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. AFFO also reflects that Capital Replacements are necessary to maintain, and Capital Enhancements are made to improve, the associated real estate assets.
        Please see Supplemental Schedules I and II for AFFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
        CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS AND CAPITAL ENHANCEMENTS (CR AND CE): CR and CE are components of total capital expenditures. CR expenditures are required to maintain Aimco's assets and CE expenditures are made to improve Aimco's assets by adding a new feature or revenue source.
        CR and CE spending are components of capital expenditures denoted as line items in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
        DISPOSITION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: Disposition Capital Expenditures are those capital expenditures made on conventional and affordable properties sold, held for sale, or identified as to-be-sold within one year and those capital expenditures made on certain affordable properties that are subject to regulatory restrictions on distribution and that are expected to be sold on completion of regulatory requirements.
        FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF, as defined by Aimco, is net operating income from real estate minus Capital Replacement spending required to maintain, and Capital Enhancement spending made to improve, the related assets. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the Investment Management Business, Interest and Other Income, General and Administrative expenses, Provision for losses on accounts, fees and notes receivable and other expenses incurred by Aimco. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to
the cost of capital. Because Aimco has substantial unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
        Please see Supplemental Schedule II for FCF data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
        FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, dispositions of depreciable real estate property, dispositions of real estate from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. Aimco calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for amortization of intangibles and deficit distributions to minority partners. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends/distributions on preferred stock/partnership units (net of preferred dividends/distributions relating to convertible securities the conversion of which is dilutive to FFO) and adding back the interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities the conversion of which is dilutive to FFO. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
        Please see Supplemental Schedules I and II for FFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
        NET RENTAL INCOME (NRI): NRI is an operating measure calculated as the product of the number of rental units in Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio multiplied by occupancy multiplied by average effective rent per unit. NRI does not reflect income from all sources and does not reflect operating expenses. Therefore, NRI is not a measure of net operating income or earnings.
        SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe conventional properties in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions.
        Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership.
        Please see Supplemental Schedules VIII through XIII for Same Store data reconciled to Rental and other property revenues and Property operating expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.
        UNCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS: Unconsolidated balance sheet items such as Aimco's share of unconsolidated cash, unconsolidated restricted cash, unconsolidated accounts receivable, unconsolidated current liabilities and unconsolidated debt are components of Balance Sheet line items on the GAAP Financial Statements that are useful in understanding Aimco's proportionate share of assets and liabilities, prior to consolidation in GAAP financial statements.
Supplemental Schedule I Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations [a] (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited)
[a]
Effective with the fourth quarter 2003 and for all periods presented, Aimco has adjusted its presentation of Funds From Operations (FFO) to conform to the NAREIT definition to deduct the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of all adjustments and remove the common partnership units in the Aimco Operating Partnership, which had previously been assumed to have been redeemed in exchange for Aimco's Class A Common Stock.
[b]
In second quarter 2003, on a prospective basis, Aimco began classifying capital spending on properties sold, held for sale or identified to be sold as Disposition Capital Expenditures. As a result, Capital Replacements now reflects the capital spending on non-sale properties.
[c]
On October 1, 2003, NAREIT clarified its definition of FFO to include impairment losses, which previously had been added back to calculate FFO. Although Aimco's presentation conforms with the NAREIT definition, Aimco considers such approach to be inconsistent with the treatment of gains on dispositions of real estate, which are not included in FFO. Aimco no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with this clarification. As a result, FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2003 includes impairment losses of $4.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively. FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2002 includes an adjustment of $4.5 million and $8.5 million, respectively, to reflect this change.
As a result of the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, Aimco has complied with the clarification of including redemption related preferred stock issuance costs for all prior periods presented in FFO. Therefore, FFO for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes issuance costs of $7.6 million.

Reporting by Business Component
INTRODUCTION    Starting in the third quarter 2003, Aimco is providing business component reporting for Aimco Conventional operations and Aimco Capital with the addition of Supplemental Schedules XVI through XXVIII. These schedules present select, non-GAAP information related to income statement, free cash flow, balance sheet and operating measures. The Conventional and Aimco Capital business components are differentiated primarily in that Conventional rents are set in the market and paid by the consumer and Affordable rents, i.e., those earned by properties operated by Aimco Capital, are set pursuant to government regulations and paid, in large part, by the government.
CONVENTIONAL    The Conventional property portfolio includes both high-rise and garden style properties offering a wide range of rents and located to provide Aimco geographic diversification in its portfolio. The principal activities of Conventional operations are:
1.
ownership, both outright and in partnership, on a long-term basis of properties whose locations are regarded as enduring. Conventional property operations are concentrated in 46 markets, which Aimco describes as its "Selected" markets (the "Core Portfolio");
2.
ownership, both outright and in partnership, of properties that Aimco intends to hold for an intermediate term and that are located outside the Selected markets or which are located in less favored locations within the Selected markets (the "Non-Core Portfolio");
3.
redevelopment of conventional properties, generally within the Core Portfolio.
AIMCO CAPITAL    Aimco Capital oversees the Affordable property operations, the management of which requires specialized accounting and legal expertise to comply with the regulatory framework that affects Affordable property ownership and management. The principal activities of Aimco Capital operations are:
1.
ownership, both outright and in partnership, of approximately 500 properties including 60,000 units located in 47 states;
2.
asset management of the above as well as two other large portfolios that are asset managed only, which include an additional 400 properties with 40,000 units;
3.
oversight of related transactional activity that can generate fees for asset management, disposition activity, refinancing, syndication of tax credits and redevelopment.
        The Conventional and Aimco Capital business components have different operating managements and share corporate services such as accounting, purchasing, debt placement, legal, human resources, information technology and partner relations.
