rating Strategies 
 
Pricing:
Challenge
Relative effective rent levels versus main competitors declined since 1Q01
 - 
                      
While recovery began mid-2003, today Aimco is 2% or $15 /unit below competitive parity.  Equals $30 million per year
 - 
                      
 
Response
Effective market rent on rose $16 per unit, or 2.2%, from $721 to $737 and 2.5% on 5,816
 - 
                      
leases initiated in the fourth quarter
renewals in January
Implemented standard pricing process on new leases in February and with April renewals
 - 
                      
Pricing process focuses on effective market rents at the floor plan level, based on rate change in occupancy and projected demand
 - 
                      
Packaging of market rents versus concessions in the hands of regional managers
 - 
                     
Greatest opportunities to increase effective rents comprise 40% of Aimco conventional Free Cash Flow
 - 
                      
 
 
 - 
                      
Res
ident Quality:
Challenge
Significant variations in resident qualifications and financial stability score standards
 - 
                      
Variations correlated with differences in property performance across a number of metrics
 - 
                      
Average resident risk factor for 2003 was 15%, with range from 5% to 25%
 - 
                      
Largest negative variances in Denver, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta and Indianapolis
 - 
                     
 
Response
Implemented standard criteria which operate regardless of income or rent levels
 - 
                      
Fully implemented in 4Q 2003
 - 
                     
New range of resident risk scores is 5% to 11% with an average of 9.6%
 - 
                      
Resident financial stability designed to make Aimco communities more desirable places to live and work
 - 
                      
 
Expect:
 - 
                      
because of higher and more stable occupancy
 - 
                               
Better financial performance
due to lower turnover and more stable and predictable occupancy
 - 
                               
Increased pricing power
in turnover, repairs and maintenance, contract services and bad debt
 - 
                               
Lower costs
With implementation of tighter credit scoring, Aimco anticipated a drop in occupancy which explains the 120 basis point sequential decline in 4Q 2003 occupancy and the expected 2% sequential decline in 1Q 2004 revenue partially offset by lower costs
 - 
                      
Proof Points from leading indicators
 - 
                      
One-third reduction in acceptance risk since October
 - 
                               
One-third reduction in A/R since December
 - 
                               
 
Ope
rating Cost Management:
Challenge
Limited visibility in projecting expenses
 - 
                      
 
Response
Detailed ground-up budgeting process implemented
 - 
                      
All communities have consistent operating expense and capital spending control log
 - 
                      
RFOs analyze not only how much we spend but how and for what
 - 
                      
 
Mea
surement and Reward System:
Challenge
Align variable compensation with key operating metrics
 - 
                      
 
Response
Monthly Scorecard  Actual versus goals
 - 
                      
Measures revenue, controllable expenses, capital replacements, customer retention, renewal pricing, new lease pace, new customer pricing, bad debt, customer satisfaction, employee turnover, product quality/appearance
 - 
                     
Applies to all levels of regional operations with different weightings
 - 
                     
Variable compensation based on Scorecard results
 -

Weighted average annual rental growth(1) in Aimco's core portfolio markets over the last 10 years - 4.24%
 - 
                      
Average annual rental growth(2) in Concentrated portfolio markets over the last 10 years - 4.74%

Reinvestment of sale proceeds
 -

 - 
                      
22 non-core properties sold in Q4.  Average rents of $580 per month
