Exhibit 99.1
        Beginning with the First Quarter 2004, Aimco has modified the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Income in order to add visibility and clarity to its operations. We believe this presentation change is helpful and provides a better understanding of Aimco's business. It is important to note that these changes do not affect the accounting treatment of amounts reported, only their classification within the income statement.
        Revenue previously classified as Management fees and other income is now presented primarily in two line items: (1) Property management revenues; and (2) Activity fees and asset management revenues. Expenses previously classified as Management and other expenses are now presented primarily in three line items: (1) Property management expense; (2) Activity and asset management expenses; and (3) General and administrative expenses (G&A).
        The new presentation also reclassifies:
 - 
Certain administrative expenses from Management and other expenses to G&A;
 - 
Income tax provision/benefit from Management and other expenses to Other expenses (income), net;
 - 
Insurance claim losses and risk management operations related to unconsolidated real estate partnerships from Management and other expenses to Other expenses (income), net; and
 - 
Depreciation and amortization related to corporate fixed assets (non-real estate related) from Management and other expenses to Depreciation and amortization.
        One of the primary reasons behind these changes is the evolution of Aimco's Investment Management business segment. Over the past few years, the amounts reported for this segment have diminished as Aimco has consolidated an increased portion of its real estate holdings and reduced its third party management activities.
        These presentation changes:
 - 
Add greater clarity to property management and activity fee and asset management business activities;
 - 
Reflect only costs that are directly associated with property management and activity fee and asset management business activities and no longer include allocable indirect costs;
 - 
Separate recurring income generated by property management from transaction-based income generated by fee and asset management activities; and
 - 
Provide enhanced visibility of Aimco's core activities to facilitate a better understanding by our investors and easier modeling for investors and analysts.
        In order to assist Aimco's shareholders in modeling and analyzing the company using this new income statement presentation, income statements for each quarter of 2003 in the new presentation format are attached.
