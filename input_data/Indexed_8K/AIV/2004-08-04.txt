Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2004
Denver, ColoradoAugust 4, 2004
Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces Second Quarter 2004 Results
SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Apartment Investment and Management Company (Aimco) (NYSE:AIV) announced second quarter 2004 results including:
 - 
Net income was $14.0 million, compared with $59.2 million in the second quarter 2003. Earnings (loss) per share (EPS) was $(0.08) on a diluted basis, compared with $0.37 in the second quarter 2003, based on net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders.
 - 
Funds from operations (diluted) (FFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the glossary in the Supplemental Information (the Glossary)) was $59.7 million, or $0.63 per share compared with $83.7 million, or $0.86 per share, in the second quarter 2003. These FFO results were calculated in accordance with the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT). Second quarter 2004 FFO decreased by $2.4 million as a result of impairment losses from real estate assets sold or held for sale. Excluding these charges, second quarter 2004 FFO would have been $61.8 million (adjusted for minority interest in Aimco operating partnership), or $0.65 per share, within Aimco guidance and exceeding First Call consensus.
 - 
Adjusted funds from operations (diluted) (AFFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary) was $44.5 million, or $0.48 per share, within Aimco guidance, compared with $68.1 million, or $0.70 per share, in the second quarter 2003. AFFO includes a deduction of $0.17 and $0.21 per share for capital replacement expenditures in the second quarter 2004 and 2003, respectively.
DILUTED PER SHARE RESULTS
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2004
Management Comments
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Under the leadership of Jeff Adler and with the benefit of an improving economy, occupancy, rental rates and net operating income for the Aimco portfolio of conventional properties increased each month during the second quarter. Similarly, David Robertson and the Aimco Capital team produced better than expected results. These positive facts make me optimistic that Aimco will enjoy improved profitability during the second half of this year."
Mr. Considine continues: "During July, Aimco marked its tenth anniversary as a public company. Thanks to our satisfied customers and the hard work of our dedicated employees, Aimco has grown from a $300 million asset base in 1994 to an S&P 500 company. Although our investment returns have been disappointing over the last three years, the compounded annual return since the IPO is 13.6%, which is in line with apartment peer returns over the same period. The entire Aimco team takes pride in what has been accomplished, and we are enthusiastic about what lies ahead."
Executive Vice President Conventional Property Operations, Jeff Adler, adds: "Dedicated efforts to drive improved revenue through a focus on sales and marketing, customer service and better pricing decisions have successfully led to an increase in "Same Store" occupancy to 92% at the end of July as well as increased rents on new leases in July. In the third quarter we expect to see improved revenue; however, it will be accompanied by higher turnover and marketing expenses in the period related to increased leasing activity. While there is much work ahead, we are setting the foundation for improved results going forward."
President and Chief Executive Officer of Aimco Capital, David Robertson, remarks: "We continue to have a strong pipeline of potential fee-generating transactions within the Aimco Capital portfolio. During the second quarter we executed more than 40 transactions, delivering asset management and transaction fee revenues of $9.3 million."
Business ComponentsConventional Operations and Aimco Capital
CONVENTIONAL REAL ESTATE OPERATIONSConventional real estate operations include Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities. At quarter-end this portfolio had 616 properties with 172,635 units in which Aimco had a weighted average 79% ownership. During the second quarter 2004, conventional real estate operations generated free cash flow (FCF; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary and presented and reconciled to GAAP on Supplemental Schedule 2) of $142.9 million. Conventional operations also generated revenues, net of expenses, of $2.4 million from property management.
"Same Store" Results
The "Same Store" portfolio is a sub-set of total conventional properties. In the second quarter 2004 the "Same Store" portfolio included 569 communities with 127,608 effective units based on Aimco's weighted average ownership of 79.9% (see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 7). Second quarter 2004 revenue from the "Same Store" portfolio was $265.6 million compared with $275.0 million in the second quarter 2003, a decline of $9.3 million or 3.4%. Comparing the second quarter 2004 with the second quarter 2003, the "Same Store" portfolio experienced
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2004
a 4.5 percentage point decrease in average occupancy from 92.6% to 88.1%, somewhat offset by a $2 per unit increase in average rent per unit from $724 to $726. Lower net rental income was somewhat offset by higher other property revenue (which includes revenue from utility reimbursements and ancillary services) and lower bad debt. "Same Store" expenses of $115.8 million increased by $4.0 million, or 3.5%, compared with the second quarter 2003. Increased expenses were primarily due to $4.9 million in expenses related to personnel costs, partially offset by $1.0 million of lower taxes and insurance. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income was $149.8 million for the second quarter 2004, down 8.1% from the second quarter 2003.
Comparing "Same Store" results on a sequential basis, total revenue declined $0.6 million in the second quarter 2004 compared with the first quarter 2004, driven primarily by a 0.9 percentage point decline in average occupancy from 89.0% to 88.1%. This was partially offset by a $1 increase in average rent per unit, increased other property revenue and lower bad debt. Expenses increased $1.9 million due primarily to higher resident turnover, personnel costs, and seasonal maintenance, somewhat offset by lower utilities and lower taxes. Net operating income decreased $2.5 million, or 1.6%, on a sequential basis.
SAME STORE OPERATING RESULTS
AIMCO CAPITALAimco Capital oversees affordable property operations, asset management and transactional activities, and is led by a management team dedicated to this sector. Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of affordable properties in the United States. During the second quarter 2004, affordable property operations included 464 properties with 56,370 units. Aimco has a weighted average 38% ownership in its affordable properties. Occupancy and rents in the affordable sector were stable and averaged 94% and $635, respectively, in the second quarter 2004, consistent with the first quarter 2004. Aimco Capital generated FCF of $19.0 million from property operations. Aimco Capital also generated property management revenue, net of expenses, of $5.0 million and activity and asset management revenues, net of expenses, of $4.6 million.
Portfolio Management and Redevelopment Activity
AcquisitionsAimco made two acquisitions during the second quarter 2004 for a total purchase price of $33.5 million. The properties include: Castle Court Apartments, a 240-unit, garden-style property located in Fall River, Massachusetts purchased for $19.0 million; and, five contiguous buildings with 72 units located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2004
purchased for $14.5 million. During the second quarter Aimco also purchased for an aggregate of $12 million additional limited partnership interests in 92 partnerships that own 163 properties.
DISPOSITIONSAimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria. Aimco considers these properties as "Non-Core" (defined in the Glossary) and seeks to hold them over the intermediate term.
Aimco sold 25 properties with 4,228 units in the second quarter 2004 for $146 million in gross proceeds. Aimco's share of net proceeds after payment of property debt and transaction costs was $47 million. See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on disposition activity.
GAIN ON DISPOSITIONSAimco's property dispositions resulted in total gains on dispositions of real estate (including gains from sales of unconsolidated entities and discontinued operations), net of related taxes, of $12.3 million for the second quarter 2004, compared with a gain of $38.9 million for the second quarter 2003.
REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITYAimco's Construction Services Group is progressing on its initiative to improve asset quality through redevelopment projects that are typically $2 million to $10 million in size and that are designed for completion primarily as units are leased to new residents. At quarter-end, eleven projects were under construction. Further information on current redevelopment projects is provided in Supplemental Schedule 10.
Additional Financial Information
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INCOMEIncome from property management is generated from management of properties in which Aimco has unconsolidated holdings or manages for third parties. Property management revenues net of expenses was $7.4 million in the second quarter 2004 compared with $7.7 million in the second quarter 2003. Property management revenues net of expenses declined primarily due to increased consolidation of real estate partnerships, resulting in the elimination of associated management income.
ACTIVITY FEE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT INCOMEActivity fees are generated from transactional activity including dispositions, refinancings, and tax credit syndications and redevelopment, and are earned primarily from Aimco Capital holdings. Asset management income is earned by Aimco Capital from the financial management of properties, rather than management of day-to-day operations. Activity fee and asset management revenues net of expenses from both conventional and Aimco Capital operations was $5.1 million in the second quarter 2004 compared with $1.1 million in the second quarter 2003. The amount of this income may vary each quarter depending upon the nature and timing of transactional activity.
INTEREST INCOMEInterest income (which includes transactional accretion income of $0.7 million) was $7.5 million for the second quarter, an increase of $0.5 million compared with the second quarter 2003. Interest income is generated from notes receivable totaling $203.6 million at June 30, 2004.
DEBT ACTIVITYDuring the second quarter 2004, Aimco closed 17 mortgage loans, all of which were refinancings of existing mortgage debt. Total proceeds were $111.6 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.85%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs, and distributions to limited partners totaling $102.7 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $8.9 million.
Apartment Investment and Management Company Second Quarter 2004
During the second quarter 2004 Aimco drew $158.1 million on its revolving credit facility ($100 million of which was used to redeem the 9.0% Class P Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock), increasing the balance from $127.5 million to $285.6 million and leaving $159.4 million (less $22.7 million in outstanding letters of credit) in available capacity.
Total consolidated debt increased by $225 million during the quarter including: (i) a $67 million net increase in mortgage debt; and (ii) a $158 million increase in short-term borrowings. Please refer to Schedule 5 of the Supplemental Information for more detail on debt activity.
INTEREST EXPENSEConsolidated interest expense was $96.4 million for the second quarter 2004, an increase of $5.2 million when compared with $91.2 million in the second quarter 2003. The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of: (i) lower capitalized interest with the completion of Flamingo South Beach; and (ii) increased corporate borrowings.
PREFERRED STOCK ACTIVITYAs previously announced, during the second quarter Aimco redeemed the 9.0% Class P Convertible Cumulative Preferred Stock for $100 million.
G&AGeneral and administrative expenses for the second quarter 2004 were $18.4 million, up from $7.6 million in the second quarter 2003. This increase is primarily due to: (i) $3.2 million of higher salaries and benefit costs due to increased staffing levels and a new health care plan, and higher variable compensation costs; (ii) $0.9 million of one-time executive recruitment and relocation costs; (iii) $1.3 million of higher compliance costs resulting from Sarbanes 404 and increased legal fees; (iv) $0.2 million of increased travel costs incurred in connection with monthly Regional Operating Center reviews by senior management; (v) $1.9 million favorable change in estimate in the second quarter of 2003 pertaining to the collectibility of corporate receivables from unconsolidated partnerships; and (vi) miscellaneous other one-time expenses incurred in 2004 and one-time benefits realized in 2003.
OTHER INCOME, NETOther income, net was $0.6 million for the second quarter 2004 compared with $3.6 million in the second quarter 2003. This line item primarily includes income tax provisions/benefits, partnership expenses and risk management activities related to unconsolidated partnerships. The decline in income in the second quarter 2004 compared with the second quarter 2003 is primarily due to risk management activities.
Outlook
For the third quarter 2004, FFO is forecast to range from $0.66 to $0.68 per share, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, and AFFO from $0.48 to $0.51 per share. For the full year 2004, FFO is forecast to range from $2.75 to $2.78 per share, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, and AFFO is forecast to range from $2.09 to $2.14 per share. These forecast ranges are narrowed from the forecast ranges provided in May 2004 of $2.75 to $3.00 and $2.03 to $2.28, respectively. Please refer to the Outlook Schedule for the third quarter and full year 2004, which follows the Consolidated Financial Statements in this release.

GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES: Consolidated properties owned less than one year as of the beginning of the most recent quarter.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES: Affordable properties benefit from government programs designed to pay rental income on behalf of people with low or moderate incomes and includes properties that were owned for all periods presented.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less Capital Replacement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco operating partnership's share (AIMCO Properties, L.P.). Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. From the second quarter 2002 through the fourth quarter 2003, the calculation of AFFO also deducted Capital Enhancements expenditures (CE). CE expenditures were made to improve Aimco's assets by adding a new feature or revenue source; however, as part of changes effective as of the first quarter 2004, these expenditures are included within capital improvements. Capital improvement expenditures are not deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF.
Please see Supplemental Schedule I for AFFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): As of the first quarter 2004, CI expenditures include all non-redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. This category combines certain of Aimco's prior capital expenditure categories. This new classification, along with Capital Replacements, is intended to be simpler to apply, allow more discrete differentiation between categories, facilitate sound economic decisions, and assist investors and analysts in better understanding capital spending.
CI expenditures are a component of Capital expenditures in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): CR expenditures do not increase the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. It represents the share of expenditures that is deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR expenditures are deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF. Effective January 1, 2004 Aimco refined the methodology in calculating CR. Please refer to Schedule 9 for further detail.
CR expenditures are a component of Capital expenditures in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
CORE PROPERTIES: Conventional properties located in selected markets that Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term.
EFFECTIVE UNITS: Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF, as defined by Aimco, is net operating income from real estate minus CR spending. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the Investment Management Business, Interest income, General and administrative expenses, Provision for losses on notes receivable and other expenses (income), net incurred by Aimco. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. Because Aimco has substantial unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
Please see Supplemental Schedule 2 for FCF data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, gains on dispositions of depreciable real estate property, gains on dispositions of real estate from discontinued operations, net of related income taxes, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships, joint ventures and discontinued operations. Aimco calculates FFO based on the NAREIT definition, as further adjusted for amortization of intangibles and deficit distributions to minority partners. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock/partnership units, adding back preferred dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and adding back the interest
expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for FFO data reconciled to Net Income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
NET RENTAL INCOME (NRI): NRI is an operating measure calculated as the product of the number of rental units in Aimco's "Same Store" portfolio multiplied by average occupancy multiplied by average effective rent per unit. NRI does not reflect income from all sources and does not reflect operating expenses. Therefore, NRI is not a measure of net operating income or earnings.
NON-CORE PROPERTIES: Properties located in markets that are not considered selected markets or in less favored locations within selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for the intermediate term.
OTHER PROPERTIES: Properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
PARTNERSHIP EXPENSES: Expenses incurred at the partnership level, either directly or indirectly, such as audit, tax and legal.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (2) other significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (done upon lease expirations), is underway or has been complete for less than one year, as of the earliest period presented. In both cases the properties have been removed from the Same Store portfolio.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe conventional properties in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions.
Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership.
Please see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c for Same Store data reconciled to Rental and other property revenues and Property operating expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.
UNCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ITEMS: Unconsolidated balance sheet items such as Aimco's share of unconsolidated cash, unconsolidated restricted cash, unconsolidated accounts receivable, unconsolidated current liabilities and unconsolidated debt are components of Balance Sheet line items on the GAAP financial statements that are useful in understanding Aimco's proportionate share of assets and liabilities, prior to consolidation in the GAAP financial statements.
Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations [a] (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited)
[a]    Effective with the fourth quarter 2003 and for all periods presented, Aimco has adjusted its presentation of Funds From Operations (FFO) to conform to the NAREIT definition to deduct the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of all adjustments and remove the common partnership units in the Aimco Operating Partnership, which had previously been assumed to have been redeemed in exchange for Aimco's Class A Common Stock.
[b]    Effective January 1, 2004 and on a prospective basis, Capital Enhancements are now included as part of Capital Improvements (See Supplemental Schedule 9 for further details).
[c]    On October 1, 2003, NAREIT clarified its definition of FFO to include impairment losses, which previously had been added back to calculate FFO. Although Aimco's presentation conforms with the NAREIT definition, Aimco considers such approach to be inconsistent with the treatment of gains on dispositions of real estate, which are not included in FFO. Aimco no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with this clarification. As a result, FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 includes impairment losses of $2.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively. FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003 includes an adjustment of $2.7 million and $7.9 million, respectively, to reflect this change.
[d]    In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, Aimco now includes redemption related preferred stock issuance costs in FFO. As a result, FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004 includes issuance costs of $0.08 million, respectively. FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003 includes an adjustment of $2.2 million, respectively, to reflect this change.

Same store amounts in this schedule may differ from the same store amounts in Schedules 6a-6c.

Capital Expenditures For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2004 (in thousands, except per unit) (unaudited)
Effective January 1, 2004, all capital spending is classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI") or Redevelopment. These categories replace Aimco's prior capital spending categories - capital replacements, capital enhancements, redevelopment, initial capital expenditures, and disposition capital expenditures. Aimco believes the new classifications will be simpler to apply, allow more discrete differentiation between categories, facilitate sound economic decisions, and assist investors and analysts in better understanding of its capital spending.
Non-redevelopment capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
The table below details Aimco's share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for Capital Replacements Capital Improvements and Redevelopment for the six months ended June 30, 2004 (per unit is based on approximately 158,000 units):
