Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among the Company, AIMCO Properties, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, as managers for the underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Underwriters 3,000,000 shares of its 7.875% Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Class Y Preferred Stock"), at a price of $24.2125 per share, for resale to the public by the Underwriters at $25 per share. The Company also gave the Underwriters an option to purchase up to 450,000 additional shares of the Class Y Preferred Stock to cover over-allotments. The over-allotment option has been exercised in full. The closing of the sale of the 3,450,000 shares of Class Y Preferred Stock contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement occurred on December 21, 2004. A copy of the Underwriting Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03 Amendment to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.
     On December 17, 2004, the Company filed with the State of Maryland Articles Supplementary relating to the Class Y Preferred Stock (the "Class Y Articles"), which Articles Supplementary were effective on filing. The Class Y Articles will classify 3,450,000 authorized but unissued shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock into 3,450,000 shares of Class Y Preferred Stock. The Class Y Preferred Stock entitles the holders thereof to cumulative cash dividends payable quarterly in an amount per share equal to $0.49219 per quarter. The liquidation preference for the Class Y Preferred Stock is $25 per share, plus an amount equal to accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not earned or declared. The Class Y Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to December 21, 2009, except in limited circumstances relating to the ownership limitation necessary to preserve the Company's qualification as a REIT. On and after December 21, 2009, the Company will be able to redeem the Class Y Preferred Stock for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date. The Class Y Preferred Stock ranks prior to the Class A Common Stock of the Company, and on the same level as the Company's remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders of shares of the Class Y Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights. If, however, the Company has not paid dividends on the Class Y Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Class Y Preferred Stock, together with holders of other classes of preferred stock of the Company with similar rights, will be entitled to elect two additional directors to the Company's board of directors until all unpaid dividends on the Class Y Preferred Stock and such other series of preferred stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment and dividends thereon for the current quarterly period have been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment. Certain material adverse changes to the terms of the Class Y Preferred Stock cannot be made without the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Class Y Preferred Stock. A copy of the Class Y Articles is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On December 22, 2004, the Company called for redemption 1.25 million shares (with a liquidation preference of $31.25 million) of the 8.75% Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Class D Preferred Stock") (NYSE: AIVPrD; CUSIP 03748R-30-9). This redemption will be made on January 21, 2005 at $25 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date of $0.0425 per share. The redemption price is payable only in cash. This redemption is funded with a portion of the proceeds of the public offering of the Class Y Preferred Stock. After the January 21, 2005 redemption, no shares of the Class D Preferred Stock will remain outstanding.
     In addition, on December 22, 2004, the Company called for redemption all of its issued and outstanding 6 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2016 (the "Debentures") (CUSIP 45767CAB7), of which $19,643,000 aggregate principal amount is outstanding, and the corresponding 6 1/2% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities due 2016 (the "Trust Preferred Securities") (CUSIP 449516301/449516202), and 6 1/2% Trust Convertible Common Securities due 2016 ("Trust Common Securities" and, together with the Trust Preferred Securities, the "Trust Securities"), of which $15,019,250 aggregate liquidation amount of Trust Preferred Securities is outstanding and $4,623,750 aggregate liquidation amount of Trust Common Securities is outstanding. The Debentures and Trust Securities will be redeemed on January 11, 2005. All of the Trust Preferred Securities are held by public investors, and all of the Trust Common Securities are held by the Company. The proceeds from the original issuance of the Trust Securities by IFT Financing I (formerly known as Insignia Financing I) (the "Trust") were used to purchase a corresponding aggregate principal amount of Debentures, which are the sole assets of the Trust. Accordingly, upon the redemption of the Debentures, pursuant to the declaration of trust governing the Trust Securities, the Trust, as the sole holder of the Debentures, will apply the redemption proceeds of $19,643,000, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, from the Debentures to redeem the outstanding $15,019,250 of Trust Preferred Securities held by public investors and the $4,623,750 of Trust Common Securities held by the Company. The Company assumed the obligations under the Debentures and the Trust Securities in connection with the Insignia merger in 1998. The redemption price for each Trust Security is $50 per security, plus accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date. As an alternative to the cash redemption, holders of the Trust Securities have the option to convert their securities into Class A Common Stock of the Company at a conversion rate of $49.61 per security (1.007 shares per $50 liquidation amount) at any time before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 10, 2005. These redemptions are funded with a portion of the proceeds of the public offering of the Class Y Preferred Stock. After the January 11, 2005 redemption, no Debentures or Trust Securities will remain outstanding.
      On December 22, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing the redemption of the Class D Preferred Stock and the closing of the issuance of the Class Y Preferred Stock. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Annex C
     (vi) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, and such counsel has been advised by the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or threatened by the Commission. The Prospectus has been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act.
     (vii) The Company and the Operating Partnership are not and upon the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus Supplement, will not be an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     In addition, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, the Underwriters and counsel for the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Such
 
counsel did not participate in the preparation of the documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (the "") but has, however, reviewed such documents and discussed the business and affairs of the Company with the officers and other representatives of the Company in the course of the conferences referenced above. Such counsel is not passing upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus except as set forth in such counsel's opinion relating to certain tax matters delivered pursuant to Section 4(e) of the Underwriting Agreement, and has made no independent check or verification thereof.

     (iv) The Initial Equity Securities have been duly authorized and upon issuance and delivery against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be duly and validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable and free of any preemptive right (or, to such counsel's knowledge, similar rights) that are contained in the Company's Charter or arising under the Maryland General Corporation Law that entitle or will entitle any person to acquire any of the Initial Equity Securities upon issuance thereof by the Company.
     (v) The Company has corporate power and authority to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and to issue, sell and deliver to the Underwriters the Initial Equity Securities to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to such Underwriting Agreement.
     (vi) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporation action on the part of the Company and, assuming that it has been executed and delivered by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or any Vice President of the Company, has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
     (vii) The authorized capital stock of the Company conforms in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Preferred Stock," "Provisions of Maryland Law Applicable to Preferred Stock, Equity Stock and Class A Common Stock," "Description of Outstanding Classes of Preferred Stock," "Description of Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock," in so far as such description relates to the Company's Charter and By-Laws (as defined in such counsel's opinion) and the Maryland General Corporation Law.
     (viii) The form of certificates evidencing the Equity Securities is in due and proper form and complies in all material respects with the requirements of the Maryland General Corporation Law.
     (ix) Neither the issuance and sale of the Initial Equity Securities, the execution, delivery or performance of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby (i) requires any consent, approval, authorization or other order of, or registration or filing with, any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body, agency or official of the State of Maryland, (ii) conflicts or will conflict with or constitutes or will constitute a breach of, or a default under, the Charter or By-Laws of the Company, or (iii) violates or will violate any statute, law, regulation, filing, judgment, injunction, order or decree of the State of Maryland known to us, applicable to the Company or any of its properties.
     (x) The statements under the caption "Description of Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock" in the Prospectus Supplement, insofar as such statements
 
constitute a summary of legal matters, documents, or proceedings referred to therein, are accurate summaries and fairly and correctly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters, documents, or proceedings in all material respects.
     (xi) The statements in Item 15 of Part II of the Registration Statement, insofar as such statements constitute a summary of Maryland statutes or provisions of the Charter or By-Laws of the Company referred to therein, are accurate in all material respects.
     (xii) To such counsel's knowledge, the Company is not (i) in violation of its Charter or By-Laws, or (ii) in breach of any applicable statute, rule or regulation or any writ, order or decree of any court or governmental agency or body of the State of Maryland having jurisdiction over the Company or its properties.
     (xiii) To such counsel's knowledge, there are no material legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened in the State of Maryland against the Company, or to which the Company or any of its properties is subject.
     (e) The Underwriters shall also be furnished with a copy of the tax opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Company, to the effect that:
     (i) Commencing with the Company's initial taxable year ended December 31, 1994, the Company was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable, the Company to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. As noted in the Registration Statement, the Company's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, certain requirements, including requirements relating to distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which will not be reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of the Company's operation for any one taxable year will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
     (ii) Although the discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the captions "Certain Federal Income Taxation Considerations" and "Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences" does not purport to discuss all possible United States Federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Equity Securities, such discussion, although general in nature, constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary under current law of certain material United States Federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Equity Securities by a holder who purchases such Equity Securities, subject to the qualifications set forth therein. The United
 
States Federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Equity Securities by an investor will depend upon that holder's particular situation, and we express no opinion as to the completeness of the discussion set forth in "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations" as applied to any particular holder.

     (c) If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Equity Securities as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an Underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary in the judgment of the Company or in the opinion of counsel to the Underwriters and counsel to the Company to amend or supplement the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, the Company shall forthwith prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses the Managers will furnish to the Company) to which Equity Securities may have been sold by the Managers on behalf of the Underwriters and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
     (d) The Company shall make generally available to the Company's security holders and to the Managers as soon as practicable an earnings statement covering a twelve month period beginning on the first day of the first full fiscal quarter after the date of this Agreement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. If such fiscal quarter is the last fiscal quarter of the Company's fiscal year, such earnings
 
statement shall be made available not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby and in all other cases shall be made available not later than 45 days after the close of the period covered thereby.
     (e) The Company shall contribute the net proceeds from the sale of the Equity Securities to the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership shall apply such net proceeds substantially in accordance with the description set forth under the caption "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus Supplement. Upon receipt of such net proceeds, on the Closing Date, the Operating Partnership will issue Preferred Units to the Company. The terms of such Preferred Units will be substantially equivalent to the economic terms of the Equity Securities.
     (f) The Company will use its best efforts to meet the requirements to maintain its qualification for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004 (and each fiscal quarter of such year) as a REIT under the Code.
     (g) The Company will use its reasonable efforts to (i) accomplish the listing of the Equity Securities on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the issuance thereof and (ii) maintain the listing of the Equity Securities, on the New York Stock Exchange or on any other national securities exchange on which the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, is listed, for a period of three years following the Closing Date.
     (h) For a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the Prospectus Supplement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Managers on behalf of the Underwriters, offer, sell, hedge or otherwise issue any shares of preferred stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for preferred stock of the Company, other than in any transaction not constituting a public offering in which the Company is not required to register such securities for public sale for a period of thirty days from the date hereof or the sale and issuance of the Equity Securities.
     (i) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and the Company's accountants in connection with the registration and delivery of the Equity Securities under the Securities Act and all other fees or expenses in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus and amendments and supplements to any of the foregoing, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers, in the quantities hereinabove specified, (ii) all costs and expenses related to the transfer and delivery of the Equity Securities to the Underwriters, including any transfer or other taxes payable thereon, (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or legal investment memorandum in connection with the offer and sale of the Equity Securities under state law and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Equity Securities for offer and sale under state law, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in
 
connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or legal investment memorandum, (iv) all costs and expenses incident to listing the Equity Securities on the New York Stock Exchange, (v) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Equity Securities, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and any such consultants, and the cost of any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show and (vi) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section, Section 6 entitled "Indemnity and Contribution," and the last paragraph of Section 7 below, the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsel, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     6. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Managers expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Managers expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Managers, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Equity Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 6(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by
 
the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Equity Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Equity Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Equity Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to the respective amount of Equity Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Equity Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Equity Securities.
     7. The Managers may terminate this Agreement by notice given to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange
Termination.
 
or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Managers, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the judgment of the Managers, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Equity Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Managers because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     8. If, on the Closing Date, or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Equity Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate amount of Equity Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Equity Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Equity Securities set forth opposite their respective names in the Underwriting Agreement bears to the aggregate amount of Equity Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Managers may specify, to purchase the Equity Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the amount of Equity Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Equity Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Equity Securities and the aggregate amount of Equity Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Equity Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Managers and the Company for the purchase of such Equity Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Managers or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
Defaulting Underwriters.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as Maryland counsel to Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Company (Registration No. 333-113977) (the "Registration Statement") filed on March 26, 2004, including the prospectus included therein at the time the Registration Statement was declared effective (the "Prospectus"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), for offering by the Company from time to time of up to $1,049,096,085 aggregate initial offering price of certain securities described in the Registration Statement, including up to 3,450,000 shares (the "Shares," including 450,000 Shares which are the subject of an underwriters' over-allotment option) of the Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class Y Preferred Stock"), of the Company, to be issued and sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2004 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and the other underwriters identified in the Underwriting Agreement, on the one hand, and the Company and AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, on the other hand. This opinion is being provided at your request in connection with the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K and supplements our opinion, dated March 26, 2004, previously filed as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement.
     In rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have reviewed originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents:
     (a) The Charter of the Company (the "Charter"), certified by the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "MSDAT"), including the draft of the Articles Supplementary of the Company relating to the Class Y Preferred Stock, to be filed with the MSDAT (the "Articles Supplementary").
     (b) The By-Laws of the Company (the "By-Laws"), as amended and restated and in effect on the date hereof.
     (c) The Underwriting Agreement.

     (d) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and the related final Prospectus Supplement, dated December 16, 2004 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), relating to the Shares.
     (e) The resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof relating to the authorization of the Underwriting Agreement and the authorization and the issuance of the Shares (the "Resolutions").
     (f) A short-form Good Standing Certificate for the Company, dated a recent date, issued by the MSDAT.
     (g) An Officer's Certificate of the Company, dated the date hereof (the "Certificate"), as to certain factual matters.
     (h) Such other documents as we have considered necessary to the rendering of the opinion expressed below.
     In our examination of the aforesaid documents, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of the aforesaid documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity with originals of all documents submitted to us as copies (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), the absence of other agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, or actions or conduct of the parties or otherwise that would modify, amend, supplement, or waive the terms of the Underwriting Agreement or the respective rights or obligations of the parties thereunder, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties as set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, and the accuracy and completeness of all public records reviewed by us. In making our examination of documents executed by parties other than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and the valid execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and the validity, binding effect, and enforceability thereof with respect to such parties. As to any facts material to this opinion, we have relied solely upon the Certificate. We have also further assumed, without independent investigation, that the Shares will be issued in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and the Resolutions.
     Based upon the foregoing, having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, and limited in all respects to applicable Maryland law, we are of the opinion and advise you that the Shares have been duly authorized, and when issued and delivered pursuant to terms of the Resolutions, the Charter (including the Articles Supplementary), the Underwriting Agreement, and all applicable laws, and upon receipt by the Company of the consideration for

     The opinion set forth herein is subject to additional assumptions, qualifications and limitations as follows:
     (a) This opinion concerns only the effect of the laws (exclusive of the principles of conflict of laws) of the State of Maryland as currently in effect. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if any facts or circumstances come to our attention after the date hereof that might change this opinion.
     (b) We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Maryland.

     (c) We express no opinion as to compliance with the securities (or "blue sky") laws or the real estate syndication laws of the State of Maryland.
     (d) We assume that the issuance of the Shares by the Company will not cause any person to violate any of the provisions of the Charter relating to the Initial Holder Limit, the Look-Through Ownership Limit, or the Ownership Limit (as those terms are defined in the Charter).
     (e) We further assume that the issuance and sale of the Shares will not cause the Company to exceed the total limit of the authorized capital stock of the Company, as provided in the Charter.
     (f) This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K and to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Shares. In giving our consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
