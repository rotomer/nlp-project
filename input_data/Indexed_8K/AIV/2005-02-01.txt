ITEM 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     At the January 27, 2005 meeting of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco"), the Board unanimously approved compensation for 2005 for the independent directors. For each of the independent directors, James N. Bailey, Richard S. Ellwood, J. Landis Martin, Thomas L. Rhodes and Michael A. Stein, 2005 compensation will consist of an annual fee of 4,000 shares of Aimco's Class A Common Stock, which shares will be issued on February 15, 2005 pursuant to Aimco's 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, a fee of $1,000 for attendance at each meeting of the Board, and a fee of $1,000 for attendance at each meeting of any committee thereof. This compensation is consistent with the 2004 compensation for Aimco's independent directors. Terry Considine, who is the only Aimco director who is also part of management, is not an independent director and thus does not receive the fees indicated above.
