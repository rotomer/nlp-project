Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces Fourth Quarter 2004 Results
SUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS Apartment Investment and Management Company (Aimco) (NYSE:AIV) announced fourth quarter 2004 results including:
Net income was $72.3 million, compared with $37.2 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The $35.1 million increase in net income is primarily a result of an increase in net gains on dispositions of real estate (net of impairment losses, income tax and minority interests and including dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities) totaling $45.0 million, somewhat offset by $16.9 million higher depreciation. Earnings per share (EPS) was $0.53 on a diluted basis, compared with $0.19 in the fourth quarter 2003, based on net income attributable to common shareholders.
Funds from operations (diluted) (FFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the glossary in the Supplemental Information (the Glossary)) was $67.6 million, or $0.72 per share, compared with $67.9 million, or $0.72 per share, in the fourth quarter 2003. These FFO results were calculated in accordance with the definition of FFO prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).
Adjusted funds from operations (diluted) (AFFO; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary) was $47.0 million, or $0.50 per share, compared with $56.0 million, or $0.58 per share, in the fourth quarter 2003. AFFO includes deductions of $0.22 and $0.18 per share for capital replacement expenditures in the fourth quarter 2004 and fourth quarter 2003, respectively.
 
Management Comments
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco had a good quarter. Its Same Store' rental revenue continued its recovery and equaled the level achieved in the fourth quarter 2002. Aimco Capital continued to build its business of owning affordable properties and developing them with tax credit equity. Aimco strengthened its balance sheet, increased its liquidity, and lowered its weighted average cost of capital."
Mr. Considine adds: "We look for further progress in 2005 with a strengthening economy and further refinement and experience with our business plans and objectives."
Chief Financial Officer Paul McAuliffe comments: "Fourth quarter FFO of $0.72 per share met the high end of guidance, while AFFO per share was lower than expected due to higher capital replacement expenditures. Results for the quarter included a net benefit of less than one cent per share for items not considered in guidance. With regard to 2005, FFO guidance is $2.80 to $3.05 per share with Same Store' NOI projected to increase 4.0% to 6.5%." For further details, please refer to Aimco's Outlook for 2005 on page 11.
Business Components  Conventional Operations and Aimco Capital
CONVENTIONAL REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS  Conventional real estate operations include Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities. At year-end, this portfolio had 591 properties with 164,807 units in which Aimco had a weighted average 81% ownership. During the fourth quarter 2004, conventional real estate operations generated free cash flow (FCF; a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the Glossary and presented and reconciled to GAAP on Supplemental Schedule 2) of $142.4 million. Conventional operations also generated property management income of $1.3 million, principally from unconsolidated partnerships, and $4.0 million from activity and asset management income.
"Same Store" Results
The "Same Store" portfolio is a sub-set of total conventional properties. In the fourth quarter 2004, the "Same Store" portfolio included 532 communities with 121,149 effective units based on Aimco's weighted average ownership of 81.4% (see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 7).
Comparing "Same Store" results in the fourth quarter 2004 with the fourth quarter 2003, total revenue increased $6.3 million or 2.5%. The increase in revenue was generated by higher average rent, up $13 per unit or 2%, from $717 per unit to $730 per unit and from lower bad debt, down $1.8 million. Occupancy was comparable at 91.5% in the fourth quarter 2004 and 91.6% in the fourth quarter 2003. "Same Store" expenses of $115.9 million increased by $10.1 million, or 9.5%, compared with the fourth quarter 2003. Increased expenses included: $6.0 million primarily due to increased staffing and compensation to support leasing and maintenance activities; $1.2 million higher utilities expense due to increased natural gas rates; $0.8 million higher marketing expenses; and $1.5 million higher insurance expense. "Same Store" portfolio net operating income was $147.4 million for the fourth quarter 2004, down 2.5% from the fourth quarter 2003.
 
Comparing "Same Store" results on a sequential basis, total revenue increased $2.4 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared with the third quarter 2004, driven primarily by a 2.5% increase in average rent per unit from $712 to $730 partially offset by a 140 basis point decline in average occupancy. Expenses decreased $1.6 million and included a reduction in controllable operating expenses of $4.8 million, primarily from lower resident turnover, lower seasonal maintenance and lower utilities expense. The lower controllable expenses were largely offset by higher property taxes. Net operating income increased $4.1 million, or 2.8%, on a sequential basis.
Comparing the full year 2004 with 2003, "Same Store" revenue declined $6 million, or 0.6%, to $1,005 million from $1,011 million. "Same Store" expenses increased $24 million, or 5.8%, from $417 million to $441 million and NOI declined $30 million, or 5.1%.
AIMCO CAPITAL  Aimco Capital oversees affordable property operations, asset management and transactional activities, and is led by a management team dedicated to this sector. Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of affordable properties in the United States. During the fourth quarter 2004, affordable property operations included 415 properties with 49,853 units. Aimco has a weighted average 40% ownership in its affordable properties. Occupancy and rents in the affordable sector were stable and ended the fourth quarter 2004 at 95.1% and $651, respectively, up slightly from the first nine months of 2004. In the fourth quarter, Aimco Capital generated net operating income of $20.7 million from property operations, $2.7 million from property management income and $3.9 million from activity and asset management income. For the full year, Aimco Capital generated net operating income of $81.1 million from property operations, $16.3 million from property management and $18.5 million from activity and asset management.
 
Portfolio Management and Redevelopment Activity
ACQUISITIONS  Aimco made three acquisitions during the fourth quarter 2004 for a total purchase price of $62 million (Aimco share $33 million). The properties include: Hyde Park, a 155-unit high-rise located in Chicago, Illinois purchased for $19 million; and two university communities, one located at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and the second located at The University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. The university community acquisitions were purchased under Aimco's joint venture with CalSTRS (California State Teachers' Retirement System) in which Aimco has a one-third interest. During the fourth quarter, Aimco also purchased for an aggregate of $19 million additional limited partnership interests in 54 partnerships that own 129 properties. For the full year 2004, Aimco acquired 13 properties for $404 million (Aimco share $375 million) and purchased additional limited partnership interests for $39 million. See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on acquisition activity.
DISPOSITIONS  Strategic sales: Aimco completed four strategic property sales for gross proceeds of $279 million (Aimco share $191 million) at an average 4.3% cap rate and $219,000 per unit. Aimco's share of net proceeds from strategic property sales after payment of property debt and transaction costs was $99 million. "Strategic sales" include sales of properties suitable for conversion to condominiums or other properties that allow Aimco to take advantage of current market conditions and obtain favorable pricing. These sales included: Grosvenor House, a 405-unit high-rise located in Rockville, Maryland; Briar Bay Racquet Club, a 194-unit mid-rise located in Miami, Florida; Villa Azure, a 624-unit high-end community located in Los Angeles, California; and Topanga 49, a 49-unit townhome community located in Chatsworth, California. For the full year 2004, Aimco sold seven core properties and sold one land parcel for gross proceeds of $751 million (Aimco share $605 million) at an average cap rate of 4.2% and $212,000 per unit.
Non-core sales: Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria. Aimco considers these properties as "Non-Core" (defined in the Glossary) and seeks to hold them over the intermediate term.
In addition to strategic sales discussed above, in the fourth quarter 2004, Aimco sold 14 non-core conventional properties and 21 affordable properties with 3,376 and 2,484 units, respectively, for $220 million in gross proceeds (Aimco share $141 million). Aimco's share of net proceeds after payment of property debt and transaction costs was $61 million. For the full year 2004, Aimco sold 40 non-core conventional properties for gross proceeds of $358 million (Aimco share $265 million) and 60 affordable properties for gross proceeds of $248 million (Aimco share $99 million). See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on disposition activity.
GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS  Aimco's property dispositions resulted in total gains on dispositions of real estate (including gains from sales of unconsolidated entities, land sale gains and discontinued operations), net of related taxes, of $78.5 million for the fourth quarter 2004, compared with a gain of $28.3 million for the fourth quarter 2003. Total gains for the fourth quarter 2004 included $54.5 million from strategic property sales and $24.0 million from non-core property sales. For the full year 2004, total gains on dispositions of real estate, net of related taxes, was $302.6 million ($240.8 million from strategic property sales and $61.8 million from non-core property sales) compared with $92.9 million in 2003.
REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY  At year-end, Aimco's Redevelopment and Construction Services groups had 34 projects at various stages of redevelopment, including 22 conventional
 
projects and 12 affordable projects. During 2004, redevelopment expenditures totaled $137 million (Aimco share $89 million) and one major project and three moderate projects were completed. Further information on redevelopment projects is provided in Supplemental Schedule 10.
ENTITLEMENT ACTIVITY  During the fourth quarter, among other projects, Aimco continued to work on rezoning the Lincoln Place property located in Venice Beach, California and the Spring Hill Lake property located in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Additional Financial Information
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INCOME  Income from property management is generated from management of properties in which Aimco has unconsolidated interests. Property management income was $4.0 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared with $7.4 million in the fourth quarter 2003. Property management income declined due to newly consolidated properties and sales of unconsolidated properties that generated management income as well as due to a $0.9 million year-end management fee true-up. For the full year 2004, property management income totaled $23.3 million compared with $29.9 million in 2003.
ACTIVITY FEE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT INCOME  Activity fees are generated from transactional activities including dispositions, refinancings, tax credit syndications and redevelopment, and are earned primarily by Aimco Capital. Asset management income is earned by Aimco Capital from the financial management of properties, rather than management of day-to-day operations. Activity fee and asset management income from both conventional and Aimco Capital operations was $7.9 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared with $5.5 million in the fourth quarter 2003. For the full year 2004, activity fee and asset management income totaled $23.0 million compared with $11.8 million in 2003. The amount of this income may vary each quarter depending upon the nature and timing of transactional activity.
INTEREST INCOME  Interest income (which includes transactional accretion income of $1.6 million) was $7.3 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $0.6 million compared with the fourth quarter 2003. The increase is primarily due to accretion income in the fourth quarter 2004 compared with the fourth quarter 2003. Interest income is generated from notes receivable totaling $197.0 million at December 31, 2004. For the full year, interest income totaled $32.5 million compared with $24.8 million in 2003.
DEBT ACTIVITY  During the fourth quarter 2004, Aimco closed 21 mortgage loans, including 20 refinancings of existing mortgage debt and one new mortgage on a newly acquired property. Total proceeds were $132.5 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.27%. After repayment of existing debt, transaction costs, distributions to limited partners and funding the acquisition totaling $118.7 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $13.8 million.
During the fourth quarter 2004, Aimco reduced its variable rate corporate debt by $49.7 million from $418.4 million to $368.7 million. At year-end Aimco's revolving credit facility was reduced to $68.7 million, leaving $381.3 million (less $23.1 million in outstanding letters of credit) in available capacity. Please refer to Schedule 5 of the Supplemental Information for more detail on debt activity.
 
INTEREST EXPENSE  Consolidated interest expense was $90.9 million for the fourth quarter 2004, an increase of $3.4 million from $87.5 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of: (i) $5.1 million due to increased property debt balances, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on property debt; and (ii) $1.4 million in non-recurring charges in connection with the November 2004 corporate debt modification; partially offset by (iii) $3.1 million in higher capitalized interest due to redevelopment. Interest expense for the full year was $366.6 million compared with $341.8 million in 2003.
PREFERRED STOCK ACTIVITY  As previously announced on December 22, 2004, Aimco completed the public offering of 3.45 million shares of its 7.875% Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $86.25 million as well as the redemption of the remaining shares of its 8.75% Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock (Class D), which was completed on January 21, 2005. The Class D redemptions made in November and January had redemption prices (including accrued and unpaid dividends) of $36.25 million and $31.25 million, respectively. In January 2005, Aimco also redeemed the remaining Trust Based Convertible Preferred Securities, or TOPRS, for $15.02 million.
G&A  General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 2004 of $23.5 million were up compared with $20.9 million in the fourth quarter 2003. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to higher year-end variable compensation. For the full year 2004, general and administrative expenses were $78.1 million compared with $48.7 million in 2003, with the increase primarily due to increased staffing levels, higher variable compensation, a new health care plan, and legal and compliance costs.
Outlook
For the first quarter 2005, FFO is forecast to range from $0.65 to $0.70 per share, and AFFO is forecast to range from $0.47 to $0.53 per share. The first quarter FFO forecast includes $0.01 per share charge for Topic D-42 preferred stock issuance costs for the Class D redemption. Before this charge, the FFO forecast would be $0.66 to $0.71 per share
For the full year 2005, FFO is forecast to range from $2.80 to $3.05 per share and AFFO is forecast to range from $2.05 to $2.25 per share. Please refer to the Outlook Schedule for more detail on the first quarter and full year 2005, which follows the Consolidated Financial Statements in this release.
Dividends on Common Stock
As announced on January 28, 2005, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, payable on February 28, 2005 to stockholders of record on February 18, 2005. The dividend represents 120% of AFFO (diluted) and 83% of FFO (diluted), on a per share basis, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 and a 6.75% annualized yield based on the $35.55 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on January 27, 2005.

GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES: Consolidated properties owned less than one year as of the beginning of the most recent quarter.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES: Affordable properties benefit from government programs designed to pay rental income on behalf of people with low or moderate incomes and includes properties that were owned for all periods presented.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less Capital Replacement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco operating partnership's share (AIMCO Properties, L.P.). Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. From the second quarter 2002 through the fourth quarter 2003, the calculation of AFFO also deducted Capital Enhancements (CE) expenditures. CE was Aimco's categorization of expenditures made to improve Aimco's assets by adding a new feature or revenue source; however, as part of changes effective as of the first quarter 2004, these expenditures are included within the capital improvements category. Capital improvement expenditures are not deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF.
Please see Supplemental Schedule I for AFFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): As of the first quarter 2004, CI expenditures include all non-redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. This category combines certain of Aimco's prior capital expenditure categories. This new classification, along with Capital Replacements, is intended to be simpler to apply, allow more discrete differentiation between categories, facilitate sound economic decisions, and assist investors and analysts in better understanding capital spending.
CI expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): CR expenditures do not increase the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. They represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR expenditures are deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF. Effective January 1, 2004 Aimco refined its methodology in calculating CR. Please refer to Schedule 9 for further detail.
 
CR expenditures are a component of Capital expenditures in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
CORE PROPERTIES: Conventional properties located in selected markets that Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term.
EFFECTIVE UNITS: Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF, as defined by Aimco, is net operating income from real estate minus CR spending. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the investment management business, interest income, general and administrative expenses, provision for or recovery of losses on notes receivable and other expenses (income), net incurred by Aimco. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. Because Aimco has substantial unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
Please see Supplemental Schedule 2 for FCF data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock, adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and adding back the interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for FFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
NON-CORE PROPERTIES: Properties located in markets that are not considered selected markets or in less favored locations within selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for the intermediate term.
OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME), NET: Other expenses (income), net includes tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal.)
 
OTHER PROPERTIES: Properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (2) other significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (done upon lease expirations), is underway or has been complete for less than one year, as of the earliest period presented. In both cases the properties have been removed from the Same Store portfolio.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe conventional properties in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions.
Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership.

Supplemental Schedule 1
Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations [a] (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited)
[a] Effective with the fourth quarter 2003 and for all periods presented, Aimco has adjusted its presentation of Funds From Operations (FFO) to conform to the NAREIT definition to deduct the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of all adjustments and remove the common partnership units in the Aimco Operating Partnership, which had previously been assumed to have been redeemed in exchange for Aimco's Class A Common Stock.
[b] Includes amortization of management contracts where Aimco is the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where Aimco acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, Aimco believes it is consistent with the White Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry.
[c] In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in Aimco's income statement when cash is distributed to a non-controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partner's capital account, which is classified as minority interest on the balance sheet. Aimco records these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (1) recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non-controlling partner or (2) a cost related to the non-controlling partner's share of real estate appreciation. Based on White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, Aimco adds back deficit distributions and subtracts related recoveries in its reconciliation of net income to FFO.
[d] Effective January 1, 2004 and on a prospective basis, Capital Enhancements are now included as part of Capital Improvements (See Supplemental Schedule 9 for further details).
[e] On October 1, 2003, NAREIT clarified its definition of FFO to include impairment losses, which previously had been added back to calculate FFO. Although Aimco's presentation conforms with the NAREIT definition, Aimco considers such approach to be inconsistent with the treatment of gains on dispositions of real estate, which are not included in FFO. Aimco no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with this clarification. As a result, FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 includes $1.5 million of impairment recoveries and the year ended December 31, 2004 includes impairment losses of $10.7 million. FFO for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 includes impairment losses of $4.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively.
[f] In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, Aimco now includes redemption related preferred stock issuance costs in FFO. As a result, FFO for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 includes issuance costs of $1.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively. FFO for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 includes no issuance costs and issuance costs of $7.6 million, respectively.

Capital Expenditures For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 (in thousands, except per unit) (unaudited)
Effective January 1, 2004, all capital spending is classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI") or Redevelopment. These categories replace Aimco's prior capital spending categories  capital replacements, capital enhancements, redevelopment, initial capital expenditures, and disposition capital expenditures. Aimco believes CR, CI and Redevelopment will be simpler to apply, allow more discrete differentiation between categories, facilitate sound economic decisions, and assist investors and analysts in better understanding its capital spending.
Non-redevelopment capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
The table below details Aimco's share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for Capital Replacements, Capital Improvements and Redevelopment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 (per unit is based on approximately 160,000 units):
