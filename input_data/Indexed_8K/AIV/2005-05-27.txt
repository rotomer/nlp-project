(b)-(c) On May 27, 2005, Aimco announced that Mr. McAuliffe, 49, has elected to step down as chief financial officer in first quarter 2006 to assume a senior advisory role as an executive vice president supporting Aimco in various capital markets activities. Mr. McAuliffe plans to return with his family to his native New Jersey. Mr. McAuliffe has served as Aimco's chief financial officer since October 1999. Aimco will begin an orderly transition with Thomas M. Herzog, 42, currently Aimco's chief accounting officer, succeeding Mr. McAuliffe as chief financial officer.

Effective July 1, 2005, Mr. Herzog will become executive vice president and chief accounting officer and will assume the chief financial officer title when Mr. McAuliffe assumes his new role in early 2006. Prior to joining Aimco, Mr. Herzog was at GE Real Estate, serving as chief accounting officer and global controller from April 2002 to January 2004 and as chief technical advisor from March 2000 to April 2002. Prior to joining GE Real Estate, Mr. Herzog was at Deloitte & Touche LLP from 1990 to 2000.

Exhibit 99.1
DENVERCOLORADO, May 27, 2005
,
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE: AIV) today announced that Paul J. McAuliffe will step down as chief financial officer (CFO) in the first quarter of 2006. Aimco will begin an orderly transition with Thomas M. Herzog, currently Aimco's chief accounting officer, succeeding Mr. McAuliffe as CFO. Mr. McAuliffe plans to return with his family to his native New Jersey and will continue to support Aimco as an executive vice president (EVP) in various capital markets activities. Mr. McAuliffe joined Aimco in February 1999 as an EVP and assumed the role of CFO in October 1999. During Mr. McAuliffe's tenure Aimco has grown to a greater than $10 billion enterprise and its shares added to the S&P 500.
Aimco's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Terry Considine, said, "I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to Paul for his leadership as chief financial officer over the past seven years. Paul's new role will focus on key financial strategies that are part of Aimco's future planning. Paul is a true leader. During his tenure to date he has overseen not just Aimco's finances but also much of Aimco's activities. Among Paul's many accomplishments, he selected Tom Herzog to be Aimco's chief accounting officer with the expectation that Tom could eventually succeed him as Aimco's chief financial officer. Paul will continue as CFO through January 2006, allowing for a smooth and orderly transition."
Prior to joining Aimco, Mr. Herzog served as chief accounting officer and global controller at GE Real Estate. Prior to GE Real Estate, Mr. Herzog worked at Deloitte & Touche for ten years in audit and technical accounting.
Said Mr. McAuliffe, "I have appreciated the opportunity to serve Aimco as CFO and be associated with Terry and the many good and capable people at Aimco. For personal reasons, my family and I would like to return to the New York area. I look forward to my continuing role with Aimco. As for my successor, Tom Herzog is an exceptional talent who has already had a significant and positive impact on Aimco as chief accounting officer. I would expect more of the same when he becomes CFO."
Aimco will undertake a search for a new chief accounting officer to replace Mr. Herzog.
Mr. McAuliffe's compensation arrangement for 2005, which has been agreed upon in connection with this new role, is expected to increase costs and reduce Aimco's funds from operations guidance for 2005 by approximately $1.5 million.
