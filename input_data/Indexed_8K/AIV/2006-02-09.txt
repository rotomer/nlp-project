Management Comments
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco enjoyed a successful fourth quarter on several fronts:
We have a lot of momentum as we begin 2006, and I look forward to the year ahead."
Chief Financial Officer Tom Herzog adds: "Our mid-point 2006 FFO projection of $2.89 is up 7% over 2005, after adjusting 2005 by $0.22 for impairment, preferred redemption and hurricane charges. Same Store NOI is projected to increase 7%, which assumes a 5.5% increase in revenue and a 3.5% increase in expenses. Projected revenue growth is driven primarily by (i) higher average occupancy, up 2.3% from the 2005 average; and (ii) rental rate increases, up 3.5% from 2005. Expenses are expected to rise with inflationary effects on salaries and services as well as higher rates for utilities, taxes & insurance, partially offset by lower year-over-year unit turnover costs." Please refer to the 2006 Outlook on page 12 for further details.
Business Components  Conventional Operations and Aimco Capital
CONVENTIONAL REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS  Conventional real estate operations include Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities. At the end of the fourth quarter 2005, this portfolio had 526 properties with 151,613 units in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 81%. During the fourth quarter 2005, conventional real estate operations generated net operating income of $159.9 million.
"Same Store" Results
The Same Store portfolio is a sub-set of total conventional properties (see the Glossary). In the fourth quarter 2005, the Same Store portfolio included 464 communities with 109,136 effective units based on Aimco's weighted average ownership of 82% (see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 7).
Comparing Same Store results in the fourth quarter 2005 with the fourth quarter 2004, total revenue increased $17.2 million, or 7.0%. The increase in revenue was generated by: higher occupancy, up 370 basis points from 90.9% to 94.6%; higher average rent, up $17 per unit, or 2.3%, from $752 per unit to $769 per unit; and lower bad debt, down $1.9 million. Same Store expenses of $114.1 million increased by $5.4 million, or 5.0%, compared with the fourth quarter 2004. Increased expenses were primarily due to: $3.4 million increased utility costs driven by higher natural gas rates up 45%, as well as higher water and electricity rates; $1.4 million increased payroll and benefits; and $0.8 million increased turnover costs related to a greater number of turned units; all partially offset by lower repairs and maintenance. Same Store portfolio net operating income was $147.5 million for the fourth quarter 2005, up 8.7% from the fourth quarter 2004.
 
Same Store Operating Results
Comparing Same Store results on a sequential basis, total revenue increased $3.4 million in the fourth quarter 2005 compared with the third quarter 2005, driven primarily by a 130 basis point increase in occupancy and a 0.3% increase in rental rate. Expenses decreased $2.9 million, primarily due to lower unit turnover costs due to stable occupancy, lower marketing costs and lower property taxes, all partially offset by higher utilities costs. Net operating income increased $6.3 million, or 4.5%, on a sequential basis.
Comparing the full year 2005 with 2004, Same Store revenue increased $57.7 million, or 6.1%, from $941.7 million to $999.4 million reflecting a 290 basis point increase in occupancy and a 2.1% increase in rental rates. Same Store expenses increased $24.9 million or 6.0% primarily due to higher personnel, utilities and property tax expenses. Same Store NOI increased $32.8 million, or 6.3%.
CORE PROPERTIES  Core properties (defined in the Glossary) offer the potential for long-term growth at higher rates of return. In the fourth quarter 2005, Aimco reduced its core markets from 38 to 27, with core operations focused in markets located predominantly in coastal states as well as the Rocky Mountain region and Chicago. Markets moved from core to non-core include certain Texas and Midwest markets where the average four-year growth rate is projected below the core average of 3.3%. In the fourth quarter 2005, core properties accounted for 72% of conventional operations net operating income. The core properties portfolio had better operating characteristics than non-core properties (defined in the Glossary). Core property average rent was $974 per month and average occupancy was 94.1% compared with non-core, which had average monthly rent of $612 and average occupancy of 93.2%.
UNIVERSITY COMMUNITIES  Aimco's University Communities portfolio includes 15 properties with 4,443 units after completing the sale of five properties in the fourth quarter. Aimco seeks to own properties in close proximity to major universities. In the fourth quarter 2005, University Communities had average occupancy of 95.7% and average rent of $733.
AIMCO CAPITAL  Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of affordable properties in the United States. Aimco Capital has been organized to oversee Aimco's affordable property operations, asset management and transactional activities, and is led by a management team dedicated to this sector.
Affordable Property Operations
At the end of the fourth quarter 2005, Aimco's owned affordable portfolio included 357 properties with 42,204 units in which Aimco had an average ownership of 40%. During the fourth quarter 2005, affordable property operations generated net operating income of $18.2 million and property management net operating income of $2.0 million. On a year-over-year
 
basis, fourth quarter average month-end occupancy for the owned and managed portfolio increased 170 basis points from 94.8% to 96.5%, and average rent per unit increased 4.1% from $655 to $682 per unit.
Affordable Asset Management and Transactional Activity
Aimco Capital generates activity fees from transactions (including tax credit redevelopments, syndications, dispositions, refinancings and partnership promotes), and asset management income from the financial management of affordable real estate partnerships. Aimco Capital activity fee and asset management net operating income was $8.3 million in the fourth quarter 2005 compared with $3.9 million in the fourth quarter 2004. For the full year 2005, Aimco Capital generated net operating income of $72.2 million from property operations, $10.3 million from property management and $22.6 from activity and asset management compared with $81.1 million, $16.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively, in 2004. Lower net operating income from property operations and property management in 2005 compared with 2004 is primarily due to the sale of 47 affordable properties during 2005.
Portfolio Management and Redevelopment Activity
Acquisitions  Aimco did not acquire any properties in the fourth quarter 2005. For the full year 2005, Aimco purchased seven properties including 1,526 units for a total purchase price of $352 million, plus one property for which the purchase price was not disclosed. Acquired properties are located in New York, New Jersey and California and have average rents of $2,068 per month. The Palazzo East property located in the Mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles continues to lease-up and reached 79% occupancy at the end of January. See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on acquisition activity.
During the fourth quarter 2005, Aimco also purchased for an aggregate of $3.6 million additional limited partnership interests in 30 partnerships that own 91 properties. For 2005, Aimco purchased for an aggregate of $52.7 million limited partnership interests in 84 partnerships that own 153 properties.
Dispositions  Non-core sales: Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria and are typically located in markets that Aimco seeks to exit. These properties are considered non-core and Aimco seeks to hold them over the intermediate term.
In the fourth quarter 2005, Aimco sold 39 non-core conventional properties and 14 affordable properties with 8,618 and 2,146 units, respectively, for $437 million in gross proceeds (Aimco share $323 million). Aimco's share of net proceeds after repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $131 million. For the year 2005, Aimco sold 71 conventional properties and 47 affordable properties for gross proceeds of $960 million (Aimco share $726 million) and exited nine markets. Since identifying non-core properties in January 2003, Aimco has sold 190 non-core conventional properties for $1.9 billion in gross proceeds and reduced the number of conventional markets from nearly 100 to 59, and Aimco Capital has sold 140 non-core affordable properties for gross proceeds of $608 million. See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on disposition activity.
Gain on Dispositions  Aimco's property dispositions resulted in total gains on dispositions of real estate (including gains related to sales of unconsolidated entities and other and gains within discontinued operations net of related taxes), of $26.3 million for the fourth quarter 2005, compared with gains of $78.6 million for the fourth quarter 2004. For the year 2005, net gains totaled $117.4 million compared with 2004 at $302.6 million.
REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY  Aimco continues to expand its redevelopment activity. At year-end, Aimco's Redevelopment and Construction Services groups had 59 projects in various stages of redevelopment, including 37 conventional projects and 22 affordable projects. During the fourth quarter 2005, redevelopment expenditures totaled $63.0 million (Aimco share $41.8 million) as Aimco completed nine new conventional projects and initiated four new conventional projects. During 2005, Aimco's redevelopment program included the completion of interior upgrades or new construction on 2,188 conventional units of which 1,687 were leased at year-end for an estimated 33% increase in rent from prior rates. Further information on redevelopment projects is provided in Supplemental Schedule 10.
 
ENTITLEMENT ACTIVITY  Aimco has additional development opportunities tied to successful property re-entitlement activity. During the fourth quarter, Aimco received final approval for the Springhill Lake conceptual site plan, including increasing the density of the property from 2,899 to 5,800 units. Aimco currently has 27 active entitlement projects.
Additional Financial Information
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INCOME  Income from property management is generated from the management of properties in which Aimco has unconsolidated interests. Property management net operating income was $4.2 million in the fourth quarter 2005 compared with $4.0 million in the fourth quarter 2004. For the year 2005 property management income was $17.2 million compared with $22.7 million in 2004. Property management net operating income declined due to sales of unconsolidated properties and increased ownership resulting in consolidation.
ACTIVITY FEE AND ASSET MANAGEMENT INCOME  Activity fees are generated from transactional activities (including tax credit redevelopments, syndications, dispositions, refinancings and partnership promotes) and are earned primarily by Aimco Capital. Asset management income is earned by Aimco Capital from the financial management of partnerships, rather than property management of day-to-day operations. Activity fee and asset management net operating income from both conventional and Aimco Capital operations was $11.7 million in the fourth quarter 2005 compared with $7.9 million in the fourth quarter 2004. For the year 2005, fee and asset management income was $26.7 million compared with $23.0 million in 2004. The amount of this net operating income may vary each quarter depending upon the nature and timing of transactional activity.
Aimco received $3.1 million in "promote distributions" from an unconsolidated partnership. This income reflects provisions within the partnership agreement that reward the general partner for achieving financial returns to the limited partners in excess of established targets.
INTEREST INCOME  Interest income was $9.3 million for the fourth quarter 2005, an increase of $2.0 million compared with the fourth quarter 2004 primarily due to increased interest rates received on general partner loans and cash balances. Interest income in the fourth quarter 2005 benefited from transaction related accretion income of $0.7 million versus $1.6 million in the fourth quarter 2004. Interest income was generated primarily from notes receivable totaling $201.0 million at December 31, 2005 and from interest-bearing accounts.
DEBT ACTIVITY  During the fourth quarter 2005, Aimco closed 31 mortgage loans. Total proceeds were $290.3 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.97%. After repayment of existing property debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners totaling $224.8 million, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $65.5 million. For the year 2005, Aimco closed 91 mortgage loans totaling $971.5 million at an average rate of 5.06%. This included the refinancing of loans totaling $415.2 with prior rates averaging 7.33%.
At year-end 2005, Aimco's corporate debt balance was $617.0 million at an average interest rate of 6.21%. The balance on Aimco's revolving credit facility totaled $217 million, leaving $208.3 million (after $24.7 million in outstanding letters of credit) in available capacity. Please refer to Schedule 5 of the Supplemental Information for more detail on debt activity.
As of December 31, 2005, Aimco had $6.3 billion total consolidated debt outstanding of which $2.0 billion was floating rate. The floating rate debt included $617 million corporate debt, $668 million floating rate secured notes and $726 million of tax-exempt bonds.
INTEREST EXPENSE  Consolidated interest expense was $95.0 million for the fourth quarter 2005, an increase of $10.5 million from $84.5 million in the fourth quarter 2004. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of: (i) $8.0 million due to increased interest rates on variable rate debt and increased debt balances; and (ii) $2.5 million due to increased debt balances primarily associated with acquisition and newly consolidated properties. For the year 2005, consolidated interest expense was $367.9 million, up $25.8 million from 2004. The increase was primarily the result of (i) $21.0 million due to increased debt balances (ii) $12.3 million due to increased rates on variable rate debt and other items; partially offset by (iii) $8.5 million higher capitalized interest due to increased redevelopment activity.
 
G&A  General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 2005 of $27.2 million were up $3.7 million compared with $23.5 million in the fourth quarter 2004. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to increased compensation related to increased staffing levels, recruiting fees and higher health care costs. For the year 2005, general and administrative expenses were $92.9 million compared with $77.5 million in 2004, with the increase similarly the result of increased compensation and benefits.
Outlook
For the first quarter 2006, FFO is forecast in a range from $0.64 to $0.68 per share, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, and AFFO is forecast in a range from $0.47 to $0.51 per share.
For the full year 2006, FFO is forecast in a range from $2.81 to $2.97 per share, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, and AFFO is forecast in a range from $2.18 to $2.34 per share. Please refer to the Outlook Schedule for more detail on the first quarter and full year 2006, which follows the Consolidated Financial Statements in this release.
Dividends on Common Stock
As announced on December 28, 2005, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, payable on January 31, 2006 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2005.

Capital Expenditures For the Year Ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands, except per unit) (unaudited)
All capital spending is classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI"), casualties or redevelopment. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
The table below details Aimco's share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for Capital Replacements, Capital Improvements, casualties and redevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2005 (per unit is based on approximately 150,200 units which represent effective units (excluding non-managed units) weighted for the period):

GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES: Consolidated properties owned less than one year as of the beginning of the most recent quarter.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES: Affordable properties benefit from government programs designed to pay rental income on behalf of people with low or moderate incomes and includes properties that were owned for all periods presented.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less Capital Replacement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco operating partnership's share (AIMCO Properties, L.P.). Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for AFFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI expenditures include all non-redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. This category combines certain of Aimco's prior capital expenditure categories. This new classification, along with Capital Replacements, is intended to be simpler to apply, allow more discrete differentiation between categories, facilitate sound economic decisions, and assist investors and analysts in better understanding capital spending. CI expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): CR expenditures do not increase the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. They represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR expenditures are deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF. Please refer to Schedule 9 for further detail. CR expenditures are a component of Capital expenditures in the GAAP Statement of Cash Flows.
CASUALTY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: Casualty capital expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs is reimbursed by insurance carriers based on deductibles associated with each loss.
CORE PROPERTIES: Conventional properties located in selected markets that Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term.
EFFECTIVE UNITS: Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF is net operating income from real estate minus CR spending. FCF also includes cash flows generated from the investment management business, interest income, general and administrative expenses, provision for or recovery of losses on notes receivable and other expenses (income), net incurred by Aimco. FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital.
Because Aimco has substantial unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings. Please see Supplemental Schedule 2 for FCF data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/ distributions on dilutive preferred securities. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for FFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
NON-CORE PROPERTIES: Properties located in markets that are not considered selected markets or in less favored locations within selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for the intermediate term.
OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME), NET: Other expenses (income), net includes tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal.)
OTHER PROPERTIES: Properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (2) other significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (done upon lease expirations), is underway or has been complete for less than one year, as of the earliest period presented. In both cases the properties have been removed from the Same Store portfolio.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe Conventional properties managed by Aimco, in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. Properties classified as held for sale are not included in Same Store. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions. Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. Please see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c for Same Store data reconciled to rental and other property revenues and property operating expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.
