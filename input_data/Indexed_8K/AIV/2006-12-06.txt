ITEM 8.01.
Other Events
     Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company") is re-issuing, in an updated format, its historical financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, in connection with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 requires the primary assets and liabilities of the Company's consolidated properties that are classified as held for sale to be presented separately in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and requires the results of operations of such properties to be reported as discontinued operations in the Company's consolidated statements of income. For each period presented in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported the assets, liabilities and results of operations of its consolidated properties that were sold or classified as held for sale during the first nine months of 2006 in accordance with SFAS 144. Under SEC requirements, the assets and liabilities of those properties are required to be reported as held for sale, and the results of operations of those properties are required to be reported as discontinued operations, in all previously issued financial statements presented in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, if those financial statements are incorporated by reference in subsequent filings with the SEC made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, even though those financial statements relate to periods prior to the date the properties met the criteria in SFAS 144 to be reported as held for sale and discontinued operations. The adjustments to reflect the presentation of properties as held for sale and discontinued operations have no effect on the Company's reported net income available to common stockholders or funds from operations.
     This Current Report on Form 8-K updates Items 6, 7 and 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 ("Form 10-K"), to present separately the assets and liabilities of the Company's consolidated properties that were sold or classified as held for sale prior to September 30, 2006, and to present the results of operations of those properties as discontinued operations. The updated Items 6, 7 and 8 are included in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. All other items of the Company's Form 10-K remain unchanged.

Selected Financial Data
     The following selected financial data is based on our audited historical financial statements. This information should be read in conjunction with such financial statements, including the notes thereto, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included herein or in previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Executive Overview
     We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the ownership, acquisition, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or managed 1,370 apartment properties containing 240,484 units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases.
     The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Funds From Operations, or FFO; FFO less spending for Capital Replacements, or AFFO; same store property operating results; net operating income; net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements, or Free Cash Flow; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. These terms are defined and described in the sections captioned "Funds From Operations" and "Capital Expenditures" below. The key macro-economic factors and non-financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: rates of job growth; single-family and multifamily housing starts; and interest rates.
     Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties, the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties, and the volume and timing of fee transactions affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings.
     Our focus in 2005 has been to increase revenue and implement cost management and productivity initiatives, which includes centralizing purchasing, restructuring business processes, using technology to increase efficiency and implementing structured monthly reporting to identify issues and improve effectiveness of spending. We believe that our efforts are having their intended effect, are resulting in a positive trend in certain operating results and are the foundation for improved long-term operating results. These initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality, and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions.
     For 2006, our focus will include the following: continue to improve operations so that customer satisfaction and occupancy increase to bring improved profitability; upgrade the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management and redevelopment; increase efficiency through improved business processes and automation; improve balance sheet flexibility; minimize our cost of capital in the face of rising interest rates; and monetize a portion of the value inherent in our properties with increased entitlements.
     The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements.
 
Results of Operations
Overview
     
2005 compared to 2004
     We reported net income of $71.0 million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to net income of $263.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, decreases of $192.5 million and $191.7 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section:
     These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net operating income associated with property operations, which included increases related to acquisition, newly consolidated and same store properties.
     
2004 compared to 2003
     We reported net income of $263.5 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $174.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to net income of $158.9 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, increases of $104.6 million and $109.4 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail within this section:
     These increases were partially offset by:
     The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail.
Rental Property Operations
     Our operating income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties. The principal components within our total consolidated property operations are: consolidated same store properties, which consist of all conventional properties that were owned (and not classified as held for sale) and managed by us, stabilized and consolidated for all comparable periods presented; and other consolidated entities, which primarily include acquisition, newly consolidated, affordable and redevelopment properties.
 
     The following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):
     For the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by $71.5 million, or 11.0%. This increase was principally due to a $39.3 million increase in consolidated same store net operating income (see further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results"); a $21.3 million increase related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of Palazzo East at Park La Brea and five other properties purchased in 2005 and The Palazzo at Park La Brea and 10 other properties purchased in 2004; an $18.0 million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties, which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method (21 properties first consolidated in 2005 and 42 properties first consolidated in 2004, which includes 24 properties that were consolidated due to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46); a $3.9 million increase related to operations of our affordable properties; and a $2.7 million increase related to the completion of certain redevelopment properties. These increases were offset by $6.4 million of increased property management expenses and $3.3 million of higher net casualty losses in 2005 as compared to 2004, primarily relating to greater hurricane and tropical storm damage that occurred in 2005.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income for our consolidated property operations decreased by $16.5 million, or 2.5%. This decrease was principally due to a $40.3 million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income (see further discussion of same store results under the heading "Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results"). Additionally, there was a $6.6 million decrease related to net casualty losses and other costs primarily resulting from hurricanes and tropical storms in the third quarter of 2004, which damaged over 100 of our properties and $4.0 million in higher property management expenses. These decreases were offset by an $18.2 million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties, which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method (42 properties first consolidated in 2004 and 12 properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of 2003) and a $16.0 million increase related to operations of acquisition properties, which were principally comprised of The Palazzo at Park La Brea and 10 other properties purchased in 2004, and three properties purchased in 2003.
 
Conventional Same Store Property Operating Results
     Same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties. We define "same store" properties as conventional properties (i) that we manage, (ii) in which our ownership interest exceeds 10%, (iii) the operations of which have been stabilized for all periods presented and (iv) that have not been classified as held for sale. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on our ownership in the most current period presented in each table. The following tables summarize the conventional rental property operations on a "same store" basis (which is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) and reconcile them to consolidated rental property operations (which is in accordance with GAAP) described in the above comparative discussions (dollars in thousands):
 
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, our share of same store net operating income increased $32.8 million, or 6.3%. Revenues increased $57.7 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to higher occupancy (up 2.9%), higher average rent (up $16 per unit) and lower bad debt. Expenses increased by $24.9 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to: an increase of $9.1 million in compensation expense related to increased staffing levels to support our initiatives to improve customer service; a $7.2 million increase in utilities due primarily to higher natural gas rates; a $5.5 million increase in real estate taxes; and $2.4 million of increases primarily related to turnover expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy.
 
 
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, our share of same store net operating income decreased $30.4 million, or 5.1%. Revenues decreased $6.2 million, or 0.6%, primarily due to lower occupancy (down 1.6%), offset by higher utility reimbursements from residents and lower bad debt expense. Expenses increased by $24.1 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to: an increase of $20.0 million in compensation and benefit expense related to a new employee health plan, merit increases and increased staffing levels; an increase of $4.3 million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas; and an increase of $3.9 million in marketing and administrative expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property taxes related to successful appeals and changes in estimates related to assessments.
Property Management
     We earn income from property management primarily from certain unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner. The income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property management and other associated activities. Reported revenue from property management decreases as we consolidate real estate partnerships because it is eliminated in consolidation. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by GAAP. Additionally, our revenue decreases as properties within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships are sold. Offsetting the revenue earned in property management are the direct expenses associated with property management.
     The following table summarizes the overall performance of our property management business for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):
 
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income from property management decreased by $5.5 million, or 24.3%. For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income from property management decreased by $6.9 million, or 23.3%. In both periods the decreases were principally due to an increase in the number of consolidated real estate partnerships (resulting from increased ownership and GAAP consolidation requirements), which required elimination of fee income and associated property-operating expense related to such partnerships and the sales of properties within our unconsolidated partnerships (35 properties in 2005, 53 properties in 2004 and 37 properties in 2003) that had previously generated property management revenues.
Activity Fees and Asset Management
     Activity fees are generated from transactional activity including tax credit syndications and redevelopments, dispositions, and refinancings. These transactions occur on varying timetables, thus the income varies from period to period. The majority of these fees are earned in connection with transactions related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio. We have a large number of affiliated real estate partnerships for which we have identified a pipeline of transactional opportunities. As a result, we view activity fees as a predictable part of our core business strategy. Asset management revenue is from the financial management of partnerships, rather than management of day-to-day property operations. Asset management revenue includes deferred asset management fees that are recognized once a transaction or improvement in operations has occurred thereby generating available cash. Activity and asset management expenses are the direct expenses associated with transactional activities and asset management.
     The following table summarizes the operating results of our transactional and asset management activities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):
     Included in the activity fees and asset management revenues, primarily from affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, were $33.3 million, $30.3 million and $18.9 million, respectively, of fees related to affordable properties within the Aimco Capital portfolio.
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased $3.8 million, or 16.6%. This overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to syndication and developer activities of $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively, as well as a $1.2 million decrease in expenses associated with these activities. Additionally, we received $3.1 million in promote distributions from an unconsolidated partnership, as a result of us, as general partner, achieving financial returns to the limited partners in excess of established targets. These increases were offset by a $5.2 million decrease in asset management fees and decreases of $3.3 million and $1.9 million in activity fees related to disposition and refinancing activities, respectively.
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased by $11.1 million, or 93.7%. This overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to disposition, refinancing and developer activities of $7.3 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, due to a greater number of transactions in 2004 than in 2003. Additionally, there was an increase of $2.9 million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from closed transactions and improved operations. These increases were offset by a $2.1 million decrease in syndication fees and $3.5 million in higher expenses associated with these activities.
Depreciation and Amortization
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization increased $62.2 million, or 19.1%. This increase was principally due to: $34.6 million of additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively (see Impairment of Long-Lived Assets in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8); $13.8 million and $8.3 million of
 
additional depreciation related to newly consolidated and acquisition properties, respectively; and $11.0 million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties. Additionally, $4.3 million of the increase was due to a change in estimated useful lives that apply to capitalized payroll and certain indirect costs (see Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased $30.7 million, or 10.4%. This increase was principally due to $8.5 million and $7.2 million of additional depreciation related to the newly consolidated and acquisition properties, respectively, as well as $9.9 million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties. Additionally, $5.9 million of the increase resulted from additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively (see Impairment of Long-Lived Assets in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
General and Administrative Expenses
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, general and administrative expenses increased $15.4 million, or 19.9%. This increase was principally due to $14.1 million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels, increased health care costs, and transition costs associated with the chief financial and chief accounting officer positions. Additionally, at the end of 2005 there was $0.6 million in severance costs related to the restructuring of regional operating centers as a result of property dispositions.
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, general and administrative expenses increased $29.1 million, or 60.1%. This increase was principally due to: $15.5 million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels, merit increases and variable compensation; $7.7 million related to increased health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in 2003 related to our accrual for insurance claims incurred but not reported (IBNR); $3.2 million in increased amortization of restricted stock and stock option compensation; and $3.1 million in legal costs and compliance costs primarily related to the internal control reporting requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Other Expenses (Income), Net
     Other expenses (income), net includes income tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses.
     For the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, other expenses (income), net changed $6.2 million from expense of $1.5 million in 2004 to income of $4.7 million in 2005. This change was principally due to an $9.5 million higher income tax benefit recognized in 2005 as compared to 2004, reflecting increased losses of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (see further discussion in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). In the year ended December 31, 2005, there was a tax benefit of $16.1 million recorded, as compared to $6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2004. Additionally, we had higher income associated with our risk management activities, primarily due to better workers compensation claim experience as a result of more focused loss prevention measures. These increases in other income were partially offset by $3.8 million of higher partnership expenses primarily related to increases in professional fees.
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, other expenses (income), net changed $8.6 million from income of $7.1 million in 2003 to expense of $1.5 million in 2004. This change was principally due to an $11.3 million lower income tax benefit recognized in 2004 as compared to 2003, due primarily to an $8.0 million benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in 2003 (see further discussion in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). In the year ended December 31, 2004, there was a tax benefit of $6.7 million recorded, as compared to $18.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2003.
Interest Income
     Interest income consists primarily of interest and accretion on general partner notes receivable from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period.
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, interest income decreased $1.0 million, or 3.2%. This decrease was principally a result of $3.8 million in lower accretion income, partially offset by higher interest income from money market and interest-bearing accounts due to increased interest rates and higher cash balances.
 
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income increased $7.8 million, or 32.0%. This increase was principally a result of $5.0 million in higher interest due from general partner notes receivable, and $3.0 million in higher accretion income.
Interest Expense
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, increased $25.2 million, or 7.7%. This increase was principally due to: $16.0 million and $5.0 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition and newly consolidated properties, respectively; $17.7 million due to increased borrowings and increased interest rates on corporate and variable rate property debt and other items. These increases were partially offset by: $4.8 million in lower amortization of loan costs, primarily due to corporate debt restructuring in 2004; $8.5 million in higher capitalized interest due to increased redevelopment activity; and a $2.1 million decrease related to the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in 2004 and early 2005.
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense increased $23.3 million, or 7.7%. This increase was principally due to: $9.9 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to the newly consolidated properties; $9.6 million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition properties; and a $4.7 million decrease in capitalized interest due to redevelopment properties being placed in service. Additionally, an $8.8 million increase related to the credit facility and term loan (of which $1.8 million was associated with the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the November 2004 modification of the credit facility and term loan and $0.8 million related to the payoff of the indebtedness incurred to complete the acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc) due to higher average principal balances along with a higher weighted average interest rate. The November 2004 modification reduced the spread over LIBOR by an average of 1.25%, which has favorably impacted interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and $300 million term loan. These increases were partially offset by lower weighted average effective interest rates on mortgage debt due to refinancings that occurred in 2003 and 2004.
Deficit Distributions to Minority Partners
     When real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we record a charge equal to the amount of such distribution, even though there is no economic effect or cost.
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $5.8 million, or 33.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, deficit distributions to minority partners decreased $0.2 million, or 1.1%. The decrease in both periods was due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity and decreased operating results, as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships.
Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate Related to Unconsolidated Entities and Other
     Gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other includes our share of gain related to dispositions of real estate within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gain on dispositions of land and other non-depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities.
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other decreased $52.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased $66.0 million. The change in both periods was principally due to a $34.6 million gain on the sale of a parcel of land located in Florida and a $17.4 million gain from the sale of one of our unconsolidated core properties, both of which occurred in 2004.
     Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period.
 
Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
     Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects minority partners' share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships. This includes the minority partners' share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, such minority interests had a favorable effect on our consolidated operating results.
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased $9.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships increased $14.2 million. The change in both periods was driven by property operating results. During 2005 as compared to 2004 our property operating results improved, thereby reducing the benefit from minority interest. When comparing 2004 to 2003 our property operating results declined, thereby increasing the benefit from minority interest.

     For properties accounted for as held for sale, the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further policy information). The property-specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property-related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property-specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale, and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported as discontinued operations.
     For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, income from discontinued operations, net totaled $96.3 million, $212.9 million and $98.8 million, respectively, which includes a loss from operations of $4.1 million in 2005 and income from operations of $9.0 million and $26.0 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005, the income from operations included the operating results of 128 properties and one partnership that were sold or classified as held for sale during 2005 and the first nine months of 2006. In 2004 and 2003, the income from operations included the operating results of 182 properties and one partnership and 239 properties and one partnership, respectively, that were sold or classified as held for sale in 2003, 2004, 2005 and the first nine months of 2006. Due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales, the income from operations is not comparable year to year.
     During 2005, we sold 83 properties and one partnership, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $100.6 million (which is net of $4.5 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $3.8 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2005 and $14.6 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2004, we sold 54 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $233.4 million (which is net of $16.0 million of related income taxes). Additionally, we recognized $7.3 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2004 and $3.2 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners. During 2003, we sold 72 properties, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $89.7 million (which is net of $12.1 million of related taxes). Additionally, we recognized $9.0 million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in 2003 and $5.6 million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners.
     Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period. See Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more details on discontinued operations.
Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle
     On March 31, 2004, we recorded a $4.0 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of FIN 46. This charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interest that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
     We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
     Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
     Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include:
     Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long-lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded impairment losses of $3.4 million related to properties to be held and used. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we determined that the carrying amount for our properties to be held and used was recoverable and, therefore, we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties.
Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition
     Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as "par value notes," and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as "discounted notes."
     We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income.
     We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. For the year
 
ended December 31, 2005, if we had not been able to complete certain transactions, our accretion income would have been lower by $2.5 million. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods.
Allowance for Losses on Notes Receivable
     We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.
     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $1.4 million and $1.8 million in net recovery of impairment losses on notes receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we identified and recorded $2.2 million in net impairment losses on notes receivable. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors.
Capitalized Costs
     We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level. We characterize as "indirect costs" an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the regional operating center and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. Costs incurred in connection with capital expenditure activities are capitalized where the costs of the improvements or replacements exceed $250. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses. See Note 2  Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further policy information.
     For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $18.1 million, $9.5 million and $14.5 million of interest costs, respectively, and $53.3 million, $46.7 million and $45.4 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively.
 
Funds From Operations
     Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO (diluted) by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our FFO is calculated as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management. Both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans.
     Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short-term liquidity needs. In the event that the cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short-term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short-term liquidity demands. We use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long-term borrowings, both secured and unsecured, the issuance of debt or equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations.
     At December 31, 2005, we had $161.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $56.4 million from December 31, 2004, which cash is principally from sales and refinancing transactions that has yet to be distributed or applied to the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). At December 31, 2005, we had $284.0 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital expenditures, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8.
Operating Activities
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net cash provided by operating activities of $355.5 million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $10.0 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2004, driven by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to cash used to reduce current liabilities related to interest and real estate tax accruals, offset by decreases in accounts receivable related to improved collections, and decreases in prepaid expense and restricted cash balances.
 
Investing Activities
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, our net cash used in investing activities of $50.0 million primarily resulted from investments in our existing real estate assets through capital spending as well as the acquisition of Palazzo East at Park La Brea and five other properties (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on acquisitions), partially offset by proceeds received from sales of properties.
     Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we sold 83 consolidated properties and 35 unconsolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $960.0 million, of which $764.0 million related to the consolidated properties. The sale of the consolidated properties generated proceeds totaling $718.4 million, after the payment of transaction costs. Our share of the total net proceeds from the sale of the 118 properties, after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $331.8 million, of which $36.4 million related to the unconsolidated properties and was included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Sales proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes.
     We are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. Additionally, from time to time, we may market certain properties that are consistent with our long-term investment strategy but offer attractive returns, such as sales to buyers who intend to convert the properties to condominiums. Gross sales proceeds from 2006 dispositions are expected to be $750 million to $950 million, and we plan to use our share of the net proceeds from such dispositions to reduce debt, fund capital expenditures on existing assets, fund property and partnership acquisitions, redeem preferred securities and for other operating needs and corporate purposes.
     Capital Expenditures
     We classify all capital spending as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI), casualties or redevelopment. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during our ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to our ownership represents CI).
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, we spent a total of $89.7 million on CR. These are expenditures that represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we spent a total of $112.0 million, $23.9 million and $140.3 million, respectively, on CI, casualties and redevelopment. CI expenditures represent all non-redevelopment and non-casualty capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. Casualty expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss. Redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property.
 
     The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI, casualties and redevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2005 on a per unit and total dollar basis (based on approximately 150,200 ownership equivalent units (excluding non-managed units) weighted for the portion of the period that we owned the property), and reconciles it to our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the same period (in thousands, except per unit amounts).
     Included in the above spending for CI, casualties and redevelopment, was approximately $33.2 million of our share of capitalized site payroll and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2005.
     We funded all of the above capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities, working capital, property sales and borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
Financing Activities
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash used in financing activities of $249.2 million primarily related to payments on our secured notes payable, payment of our dividends, and redemptions of the Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock and Trust Based Convertible Preferred Securities, which we refer to as TOPRS, partially offset by proceeds from borrowings.
 
     Mortgage Debt
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $5.7 billion in consolidated mortgage debt outstanding, which included $260.6 million and $636.6 million, respectively, of mortgage debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we refinanced or closed mortgage loans on 68 consolidated properties generating $591.1 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.02%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $254.1 million. In addition, we closed mortgage loans on 15 unconsolidated properties, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.95%. Our share of the net proceeds from these 15 mortgage loans totaled $26.4 million. We used our total net proceeds from all loans closed of $280.5 million for corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance mortgage debt to generate proceeds in amounts exceeding our scheduled amortizations and maturities.
     During the year ended December 31, 2005, we closed five mortgage loans totaling $130.3 million, with an initial weighted average interest rate of 3.27%, to finance our consolidated acquisitions.
     Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans
     We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. On June 16, 2005, we amended our Credit Agreement, to provide for $100.0 million in additional term loan borrowings. The additional term loan matures on November 2, 2009 and bears interest at a rate of either LIBOR plus 1.75% or a base rate (determined by reference to the federal funds rate or Bank of America's prime rate) plus 0.25%. The proceeds from the additional term loan were used to repay outstanding revolving loans.
     The aggregate amount of commitments and loans under the Credit Agreement is $850.0 million, comprised of $450.0 million of revolving loan commitments and $400.0 million in term loans. The term loans mature on November 2, 2009 and the revolving loans mature on November 2, 2007. At December 31, 2005, the term loans had an outstanding principal balance of $400.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6.18% (based on LIBOR plus 2.00% for the original $300.0 million and LIBOR plus 1.75% for the additional $100.0 million). At December 31, 2005, the revolving loans had an outstanding principal balance of $217.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 6.26% (based on various weighted average LIBOR and base rate borrowings outstanding with various maturities). The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2005 was $208.3 million (after giving effect to $24.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes. For more information, see Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
     Equity Transactions
     During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Class D Cumulative Preferred Stock for $31.3 million in cash.
     As of December 31, 2005, under our shelf registration statement, which was declared effective in April 2004, we had available for issuance approximately $877 million of debt and equity securities and the Aimco Operating Partnership had available for issuance $500 million of debt securities. From time to time we may issue preferred securities in both public offerings and private placements to generate proceeds to be used to redeem higher cost preferred securities, to finance acquisitions of real estate interests and for other corporate purposes.
     Our Board of Directors has, from time to time authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock. In April 2005, our Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to a total of eight million shares of our Common Stock. These repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to applicable law. During 2005, we did not repurchase any shares of our Common Stock.
 
Contractual Obligations
     This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (amounts in thousands):
 
     In addition, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
Future Capital Needs
     In addition to the items set forth in "Contractual Obligations" above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax-free exchange proceeds), short-term borrowings, debt and equity financings and operating cash flows.
     In 2006, we plan to invest between $150 and $200 million in conventional redevelopment projects that will impact approximately 70 properties with nearly 30,000 units. Additionally, in 2006 redevelopment expenditures on affordable properties will be approximately $80 million, predominantly funded by third-party tax credit equity, impacting 20 to 25 properties with more than 3,000 units.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests range typically from less than 1% up to 50%. However, based on the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements, we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes (see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 
Stockholders and Board of Directors Apartment Investment and Management Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apartment Investment and Management Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying Index to Financial Statements. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Apartment Investment and Management Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2004 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), .
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Apartment Investment and Management Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 6, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTE 1  Organization
     Apartment Investment and Management Company, or Aimco, is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January 10, 1994. We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or managed a real estate portfolio of 1,370 apartment properties containing 240,484 apartment units located in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Based on apartment unit data compiled by the National Multi Housing Council, as of December 31, 2005, we were the largest REIT owner and operator of apartment properties in the United States.
     As of December 31, 2005, we:
     Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP, Inc. and AIMCO-LP, Inc., we own a majority of the ownership interests in AIMCO Properties, L.P., which we refer to as the Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2005, we held approximately a 90% interest in the common partnership units and equivalents of the Aimco Operating Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business and own substantially all of our assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are referred to as "OP Units." OP Units include common OP Units, partnership preferred units, or preferred OP Units, and high performance partnership units, or High Performance Units. The Aimco Operating Partnership's income is allocated to holders of common OP Units based on the weighted average number of common OP Units outstanding during the period. The Aimco Operating Partnership records the issuance of common OP Units and the assets acquired in purchase transactions based on the market price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock at the date of execution of the purchase contract. The holders of the common OP Units receive distributions, prorated from the date of issuance, in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Aimco Class A Common Stock. Holders of common OP Units may redeem such units for cash or, at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option, Aimco Class A Common Stock, which we refer to as Common Stock. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the weighted average ownership interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership held by the common OP Unit holders was 10%, 10%, and 11%, respectively. Preferred OP Units entitle the holders thereof to a preference with respect to distributions or upon liquidation. At December 31, 2005, 95,732,200 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding and the Aimco Operating Partnership had 10,339,262 common OP Units and equivalents outstanding for a combined total of 106,071,462 shares of Common Stock and OP Units outstanding (excluding preferred OP Units).
     Except as the context otherwise requires, "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and their consolidated entities, collectively.
 
NOTE 2  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities. As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "partnership" refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and "partner" refers to a limited partner in a limited partnership or a member in a limited liability company. Interests held in consolidated real estate partnerships by limited partners other than us are reflected as minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The assets of consolidated real estate partnerships owned or controlled by Aimco or the Aimco Operating Partnership generally are not available to pay creditors of Aimco or the Aimco Operating Partnership.
     FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), , or FIN 46, addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities. As a result of the adoption of FIN 46, as of March 31, 2004, we consolidate all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, a variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. FIN 46 requires a VIE to be consolidated in the financial statements of the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary generally is the entity that will receive a majority of the VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, or both.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
     Upon adoption of FIN 46, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of 27 previously unconsolidated and five previously consolidated VIEs. These VIEs consisted of partnerships that are engaged, directly or indirectly, in the ownership and management of 29 apartment properties with 3,478 units. The initial consolidation of the previously unconsolidated entities as of March 31, 2004 resulted in an increase in our consolidated total assets (primarily real estate), liabilities (primarily indebtedness) and minority interest of approximately $113.5 million, $90.6 million and $26.8 million, respectively. We recorded a charge of approximately $4.0 million for the cumulative effect on retained earnings resulting from the adoption of FIN 46. This charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interests that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits.
     As of December 31, 2005, we were the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidated, 46 VIEs, which owned 40 apartment properties with 5,816 units. Real estate with a carrying value of $378.2 million collateralized the debt of those VIEs. The creditors of the consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to our general credit. As of December 31, 2005, we also held variable interests in 107 VIEs for which we were not the primary beneficiary. Those 107 VIEs consist primarily of partnerships, in which we acquired an interest prior to the adoption of FIN 46, that are engaged, directly or indirectly, in the ownership and management of 112 apartment properties with 10,812 units. We are involved with those VIEs as a non-controlling equity holder, lender, management agent, or through other contractual relationships. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with unconsolidated VIEs is limited to our recorded investments in and receivables from those VIEs totaling $30.8 million at December 31, 2005. We may be subject to additional losses to the extent of any financial support that we voluntarily provide in the future.
 
     Generally, we consolidate real estate partnerships and other entities that are not VIEs when we own, directly or indirectly, a majority voting interest in the entity. In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 04-5, , or EITF 04-5. EITF 04-5 provides an accounting model to be used by a general partner, or group of general partners, to determine whether the general partner(s) controls a limited partnership or similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited partners and provides additional guidance on what constitutes substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. EITF 04-5 was effective after June 29, 2005 for general partners of (a) all newly formed limited partnerships and (b) existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified. We consolidated four limited partnerships in the fourth quarter of 2005 based on EITF 04-5 requirements. The consolidation of these partnerships had an immaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 19, we are required to apply EITF 04-5 to all existing limited partnerships and similar entities where we are the general partner as of January 1, 2006.
Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights
Acquisition of Real Estate Assets and Related Depreciation and Amortization
     We capitalize the purchase price and incremental direct costs associated with the acquisition of properties as the cost of the assets acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, , or SFAS 141, we allocate the cost of acquired properties to land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment and intangibles, such as the value of above and below market leases, and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. In order to allocate purchase price on these various components we perform the following procedures for properties we acquire:
Business Combinations
     The values of the above and below market leases are amortized over the remaining terms of the associated lease, including estimated lease renewals for below-market leases, to rental income. For the values associated with avoided leasing commissions and other costs that were incurred to execute leases and the value associated with lost rents during the absorption period, amortization expense is recorded over the expected terms of the associated leases. If a resident vacates the unit prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off.
     Depreciation for all tangible real estate assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Acquired buildings and improvements are depreciated over a composite life of 14 to 52 years, based on the age, condition and other physical characteristics of the property. As discussed under below, we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of prior to the end of their useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment associated with acquired properties are depreciated over five years.
Impairment of Long Lived Assets
 
Capital Expenditures and Related Depreciation
     We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level. We characterize as "indirect costs" an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the regional operating center and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. Costs incurred in connection with capital expenditure activities are capitalized where the costs of the improvements or replacements exceed $250. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses.
     We depreciate capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related component or improvement, which is five, 15 or 30 years. Prior to July 1, 2005, we recorded capitalized site payroll costs and most capitalized indirect costs separately from other costs of the related capital projects. We depreciated capitalized site payroll costs over five years and capitalized indirect costs associated with capital replacement and improvement projects over five or 15 years. Capitalized indirect costs associated with redevelopment projects, together with other costs of the redevelopment projects, were depreciated over the estimated useful lives of those projects, predominantly 30 years.
     Effective July 1, 2005, we refined the estimated useful lives for the capitalized site payroll and indirect costs that were recorded separately from other costs of the related capital projects. All capitalized site payroll and indirect costs incurred after June 30, 2005 are allocated proportionately, based on direct costs, among capital projects and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of such projects. This change in estimate is also being applied prospectively to the June 30, 2005 carrying amounts, net of accumulated depreciation, of previously incurred site payroll and indirect costs. Those amounts, based on the periods the costs were incurred, were allocated among capital projects that were completed in the corresponding periods in proportion to the original direct costs of such projects and are being depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the projects. We anticipate that these refinements will result in generally higher depreciation expense in foreseeable future accounting periods. For the year ended December 31, 2005, these changes in estimated useful lives resulted in decreased net income of approximately $4.6 million, and resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.05.
     Certain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as carpeting and appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of property casualties, where the net book value of lost property is written off in the determination of casualty gains or losses, we generally do not recognize any loss in connection with the replacement of an existing property component because normal replacements are considered in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.
     For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $18.1 million, $9.5 million and $14.5 million of interest costs, respectively, and $53.3 million, $46.7 million and $45.4 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively.
Asset Retirement Obligations
     In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, , or FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies the accounting for legal obligations to perform asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on future events. FIN 47 requires the fair value of such conditional asset retirement obligations to be recorded as incurred, if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We have determined that FIN 47 applies to certain obligations that we have based on laws that require property owners to remove or remediate hazardous substances in certain circumstances. We adopted the provisions of FIN 47 as of December 31, 2005 and determined that asset retirement obligations that are required to be recognized under FIN 47 are immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 9 for further discussion of asset retirement obligations.
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
     We apply the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or SFAS 144, to determine whether our real estate and other long-lived assets are
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
 
impaired. Such assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded impairment losses of $3.4 million related to properties to be held and used. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we determined that the carrying amounts of our properties to be held and used were recoverable and, therefore, we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties.
     Our tests of recoverability address real estate assets that do not currently meet all conditions to be classified as held for sale, but are expected to be disposed of prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. If an impairment loss is not required to be recorded in accordance with SFAS 144, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. These depreciation adjustments decreased net income by $31.9 million and $6.4 million, and resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 and $0.07, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Cash Equivalents
     We consider highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
     Restricted cash includes capital replacement reserves, tax-free exchange funds, completion repair reserves, bond sinking fund amounts and tax and insurance escrow accounts held by lenders.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
     Accounts receivable are generally comprised of amounts receivable from residents, amounts receivable from non-affiliated real estate partnerships for which we provide property management and other services and other miscellaneous receivables from non-affiliated entities. We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable from residents and establish an allowance, after the application of security deposits and other anticipated recoveries, for accounts greater than 30 days past due for current residents and all receivables due from former residents. Accounts receivable from residents are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $2.3 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
     We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable from non-affiliated entities and establish an allowance for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable relating to non-affiliated entities are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $4.2 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from Affiliates
     Accounts receivable from affiliates are generally comprised of receivables related to property management and other services provided to unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which we have an ownership interest. We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable balances from affiliates on a periodic basis, and establish an allowance for the amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable from affiliates are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $4.7 million and $4.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
Deferred Costs
     We defer lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining financing and amortize the cost over the terms of the related loan agreements. Amortization of these costs is included in interest expense.
     We defer leasing commissions and other direct costs incurred in connection with successful leasing efforts and amortize the costs over the terms of the related leases. Amortization of these costs is included in property operating expenses.
Advertising Costs
     We generally expense all advertising costs as incurred to property operating expense. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, for both continuing and discontinued operations, total advertising expense was $36.1 million, $33.1 million and $28.7 million, respectively.
Notes Receivable from Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships and Related Interest Income and Provision for Losses
     Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as "par value notes," and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as "discounted notes."
     We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income.
     We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method.
     We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.
Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
     We own general and limited partner interests in real estate partnerships that own apartment properties. We generally account for investments in real estate partnerships that we do not consolidate under the equity method. Under the equity method, our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented is included in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated real estate partnerships, except for our share of impairments and property disposition gains related to such entities, which we report separately in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investments in real estate partnerships that were acquired in business combinations were determined to have insignificant value at the acquisition date and are accounted for under the cost method. Any distributions received from such partnerships are recognized as income when received.
 
Intangible Assets
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, other assets included goodwill of $81.9 million and $88.1 million, respectively, associated with our real estate segment. We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, , or SFAS 142. SFAS 142 does not permit amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, but requires an annual impairment test of such assets. The impairment test compares the fair value of reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. Based on the application of the goodwill impairment test set forth in SFAS 142, we determined that our goodwill was not impaired in 2005, 2004 or 2003. As discussed in Note 10, we reduced goodwill by $6.2 million in 2005 in connection with the recognition of deferred income tax assets that were acquired in connection with business combinations in prior years.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
     Other assets also includes intangible assets for purchased management contracts with finite lives that we amortize on a straight-line basis over terms ranging from five to twenty years and intangible assets for in-place leases as discussed under
Acquisition of Real Estate Assets and Related Depreciation and Amortization.
Capitalized Software Costs
     Purchased software and other costs related to software developed for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally five years. We write off the costs of software development projects when it is no longer probable that the software will be completed and placed in service. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we capitalized software development costs totaling $9.9 million, $18.1 million and $18.9 million, respectively. During 2005 and 2004, we wrote off $0.5 million and $1.1 million of software development costs. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, other assets included $40.2 million and $43.4 million of net capitalized software, respectively.
Minority Interest in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
     We report unaffiliated partners' interests in consolidated real estate partnerships as minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships represents the minority partners' share of the underlying net assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships. When these consolidated real estate partnerships make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest, we generally record a charge equal to the amount of such excess distribution, even though there is no economic effect or cost. We report this charge in the consolidated statements of income as deficit distributions to minority partners. We allocate the minority partners' share of partnership losses to minority partners to the extent of the carrying amount of the minority interest. We generally record a charge when the minority partners' share of partnership losses exceed the carrying amount of the minority interest, even though there is no economic effect or cost. We report this charge in the consolidated statements of income within minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships. We do not record charges for distributions or losses in certain limited instances where the minority partner has a legal obligation and financial capacity to contribute additional capital to the partnership. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we recorded charges for partnership losses resulting from depreciation of approximately $9.5 million, $5.2 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, that were not allocated to minority partners because the losses exceeded the carrying amount of the minority interest.
     Minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships consists primarily of equity interests held by limited partners in consolidated real estate partnerships that have finite lives. The terms of the related partnership agreements generally require the partnership to be liquidated following the sale of the partnership's real estate. As the general partner in these partnerships, we ordinarily control the execution of real estate sales and other events that could lead to the liquidation, redemption or other settlement of minority interests. The aggregate carrying value of minority interests in consolidated real estate partnerships is approximately $217.7 million at December 31, 2005. The aggregate fair value of these interests varies based on the fair value of the real estate owned by the partnerships. Based on the number of classes of finite-life minority interests, the number of properties in which there is direct or indirect minority ownership, complexities in determining the allocation of liquidation proceeds among partners and other factors, we believe it is impracticable to determine the total required payments to the minority interests in an assumed liquidation at December 31, 2005. As a result of real estate depreciation that is recognized in our financial statements and appreciation in the fair value of real estate that is not recognized in our financial statements, we believe that the aggregate fair value of our minority interests exceeds their aggregate carrying value. As a result of our ability to control real estate sales and other events that require payment of minority interests and our expectation that proceeds from real estate sales will be sufficient to liquidate related minority interests, we anticipate that the eventual liquidation of these minority interests will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
 
Revenue Recognition
     Our properties have operating leases with apartment residents with terms generally of twelve months or less. We recognize rental revenue related to these leases, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We recognize revenues from property management, asset management, syndication, development and other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable.
Stock-Based Compensation
     Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the accounting provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, or SFAS 123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, or SFAS 148, and applied the prospective method set forth in SFAS 148 with respect to the transition. Under this method, we apply the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled on or after January 1, 2003, which has resulted in recognition of compensation expense related to stock options based on the fair value of the stock options. For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2003, we apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, , or APB 25, and related interpretations. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of our employee stock options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense related to such options has been recognized. We recognize compensation expense for stock options accounted for under SFAS 123 and restricted stock awards ratably over the period the awards vest. Compensation expense is reversed as forfeitures occur.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
     For purposes of the pro forma disclosures below, the estimated fair values for all awards made prior to January 1, 2003 are amortized over the respective vesting period for each such option and are shown as expense as if SFAS 123 had been applied to all such awards. Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123, which also requires that the information be determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair value method. The fair value for our options granted over the last three years was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The estimated fair value of our stock options and underlying assumptions are as follows:
     The Black-Scholes valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and does not take into account vesting requirements or restrictions on transferability. In addition, the valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
 
     The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented. Our pro forma information for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
     The effects of applying SFAS 123 in calculating pro forma income attributable to common stockholders and pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share may not necessarily be indicative of the effects of applying SFAS 123 to future years' earnings. As discussed in Note 19, we will change our method of accounting for share-based compensation in 2006.
Discontinued Operations
     In accordance with SFAS 144, we classify certain properties and related liabilities as held for sale (see Note 14). The operating results of such properties are presented in discontinued operations in both current periods and all comparable periods presented. Depreciation is not recorded on properties held for sale; however, depreciation expense recorded prior to classification as held for sale is included in discontinued operations. The net gain on sale and any impairment losses are presented in discontinued operations when recognized.
Derivative Financial Instruments
     We primarily use long-term, fixed-rate and self-amortizing non-recourse debt to avoid, among other things, risk related to fluctuating interest rates. For our variable-rate debt, we are sometimes required by our lenders to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering into interest rate swap or cap agreements. The interest rate swap agreements moderate our exposure to interest rate risk by converting the variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. The interest rate cap agreements effectively limit our exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate. The fair values of these instruments are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, and periodic changes in fair value are included in interest expense. In 2005, we entered into a natural gas commodity swap agreement to limit our exposure to increases in the price of natural gas purchases for certain properties. These instruments are not material to our financial position and results of operations.
 
Insurance
     We believe that our insurance coverages insure our properties adequately against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils. In addition, we reinsure substantial portions of our property, workers' compensation, health, and general liability insurance coverage. Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience.
Income Taxes
     We have elected to be taxed as a REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to United States Federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income that is distributed to our stockholders if we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. If our taxable income exceeds our dividends in a tax year, REIT tax rules allow us to "throw back" dividends from the subsequent tax year in order to avoid current taxation on undistributed income. Throwing back of dividends can result in excise taxes. REITs are also subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income will be subject to United States Federal income tax at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax). Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local income taxes and to United States Federal income tax. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax on non-arms length transactions between us and a taxable REIT subsidiary and on any net income from sales of property that was property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course.
     Certain of our operations (property management, asset management, risk, etc.) are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are subsidiaries of the Aimco Operating Partnership and each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and as such is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use the TRS format to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents, which services and activities are not generally considered to be qualifying REIT activities.
     For our taxable REIT subsidiaries, deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for Federal income tax purposes, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We reduce deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance when we determine based on available evidence that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.
Earnings per Share
     We calculate earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, common stock equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period (see Note 15).
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
     The aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short-term secured debt as of December 31, 2005 approximates their carrying value due to their relatively short-term nature. We further believe that the fair value of our variable rate secured tax-exempt bond debt and secured long-term debt also approximate their carrying value. For notes receivable, fixed rate secured tax-exempt bond debt and secured long-term debt, fair values have been based on estimates using present value techniques. Present value calculations vary significantly depending on the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. We estimate fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements based on the market rate for debt with the same or similar terms. In many cases, the fair value estimates may not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. The estimated combined fair value of our notes receivable at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, was approximately $211 million and $201 million, respectively. See Note 5 for further details on notes receivable. The estimated combined fair value of our secured tax-exempt bonds and secured notes payable, including amounts within liabilities related to assets held for sale, at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, was approximately $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. The combined carrying value of our secured tax-exempt bonds and secured notes payable, including amounts within liabilities related to assets held for sale, at both December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, was approximately $5.7 billion. See Note 6 for further details on secured tax-exempt bonds and secured notes payable.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
     Financial instruments that potentially could subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of notes receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes receivable are limited due to the large number of partnerships comprising our partnership base, and the geographic diversity of the underlying properties.
Use of Estimates
     The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
     Certain items included in the 2004 and 2003 financial statements amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.
NOTE 3  Acquisitions
Real Estate Acquisitions
     During 2005, we completed acquisitions of six properties (including Palazzo East at Park La Brea), containing approximately 1,006 residential units and six retail spaces for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $283.6 million, including transaction costs. Of the six properties acquired, four are located in the New York City area, one in Los Angeles, and one in New Jersey. The purchases were funded with cash, new debt and the assumption of existing debt.
     During 2004, we completed acquisitions of 11 properties (including The Palazzo at Park La Brea), containing approximately 1,880 residential units (and some ground floor retail space) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $361 million. Of the 11 properties acquired, six are located in the New York City area, one in Los Angeles, two in Massachusetts, one in Florida and one in the Chicago area. The purchases were funded with cash, tax-free exchange funds, new debt and the assumption of existing debt.
Acquisitions of Partnership Interests
     During 2005 and 2004, we acquired limited partnership interests in 84 partnerships and 147 partnerships, respectively, in which our affiliates served as general partner. In connection with such acquisitions in both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, during 2005 we paid approximately $56.0 million, including transaction costs, of which $55.6 million was in cash and the remainder in OP Units, and during 2004 we paid approximately $50.0 million, including transaction costs, of which $47.8 million was in cash and the remainder in OP Units. The 2005 and 2004 amounts were approximately $60.6 million and $89.2 million, respectively, in excess of the carrying amount of minority interest in such limited partnerships, which excess we generally assigned to real estate.
 
NOTE 4  Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
     We owned general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships owning approximately 264, 330 and 441 properties at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We acquired these interests through various transactions, including large portfolio acquisitions and offers to individual limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships ranges typically from less than 1% to 50%.
     The following table provides selected combined financial information for unconsolidated real estate partnerships as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):
     The decrease in the amounts in the above table from year to year was primarily due to dispositions of real estate owned by the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and our purchase of additional interests in, and resulting consolidation of, various partnerships previously accounted for under the equity method
.
     As a result of our acquisition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, the investment in these partnerships at December 31, 2005 and 2004 of $167.8 million and $207.8 million, respectively, is approximately $236.0 million and $272.3 million, respectively, in excess of our share of the underlying historical partners' deficit of the partnerships. The excess of the cost of the investments acquired over the equity in the underlying historical partners' deficit is primarily ascribed to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the unconsolidated real estate partnerships. We amortize the excess basis related to the buildings over the estimated useful lives of the buildings. Such amortization is recorded as a component of equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
NOTE 5  Notes Receivable
     The following table summarizes our notes receivable at December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands):
     Included in notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December 31, 2005 and 2004, are $28.8 million and $31.3 million, respectively, in notes that were secured by interests in real estate or interests in real estate partnerships. We earn interest on these secured notes receivable at various annual interest rates ranging between 6.0% and 12.0% and averaging 10.3%.
 
     Included in the notes receivable from non-affiliates at December 31, 2005 and 2004, are $6.4 million and $9.1 million, respectively, in notes that were secured by interests in real estate or interests in real estate partnerships. We earn interest on these secured notes receivable at various annual interest rates ranging between 4.0% and 7.3% and averaging 6.1%.
     Additionally, included in notes receivable from non-affiliates at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are notes receivable from Alan I. Casden for an aggregate of $2.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively. The notes were part of the settlement of litigation involving NAPICO that was underway prior to the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc. (which we refer to as the Casden Transactions) in which we acquired NAPICO. The notes were secured by certain shares of Common Stock and certain cash settlement proceeds. In 2004, we entered into an agreement with respect to certain proceeds to be received by Alan I. Casden and his right to deliver Common Stock at an agreed-upon value of $47 per share in satisfaction of the Notes. Pursuant to this agreement, in 2004 we received $20 million in cash as payment in full on three notes due in 2004, 2005 and 2006. In 2005, we received cash payments of $7.0 million in satisfaction of the note due in 2007 and in partial satisfaction of the note due in 2008. In 2006, we will receive a final payment of $2.5 million in satisfaction of the note due in 2008. This transaction resolved a contingency based on the price of our Common Stock related to the Casden Transactions. In accordance with SFAS 141, in 2004 we recorded a $4.8 million charge to additional paid-in capital, representing the difference between the $29.1 million fair value of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the settlement and the $33.9 million book value of the notes.
     Interest income from total non-impaired par value and certain discounted notes for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $19.2 million, $20.5 million and $15.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, we recognized accretion income on certain discounted notes of approximately $2.5 million, $6.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively.
     The activity in the allowance for loan losses in total for both par value notes and discounted notes for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, is as follows (in thousands):
     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we determined that an allowance for loan losses of $2.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively, was required on certain of our par value notes that had carrying values of $6.5 million and $17.1 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in the impaired par value notes for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $6.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively. The remaining $105.8 million in par value notes receivable at December 31, 2005 is estimated to be collectible and, therefore, interest income on these par value notes is recognized as it is earned.
     As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we determined that an allowance for loan losses of $2.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, was required on certain of our discounted notes that had carrying values of $5.0 million and $6.0 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in the impaired discounted notes for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $5.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively.
 
NOTE 6  Secured Tax-Exempt Bond Financings and Secured Notes Payable
     The following table summarizes our secured tax-exempt bond financings at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the majority of which is non-recourse to us (in thousands):
     Fixed rate secured tax-exempt bonds payable mature at various dates through October 2045. Variable rate secured tax-exempt bonds payable mature at various dates through June 2034. Principal and interest on these bonds are generally payable in semi-annual installments or in monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. Certain of our tax-exempt bonds at December 31, 2005 are remarketed periodically by a remarketing agent to maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. We believe that the likelihood of this occurring is remote. At December 31, 2005, our secured tax-exempt bond financings were secured by 75 properties with a combined net book value of $1,054.3 million.
     The following table summarizes our secured notes payable at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the majority of which are non-recourse to us (in thousands):
     Fixed rate secured notes payable mature at various dates through August 2053. Variable rate secured notes payable mature at various dates through August 2011. Principal and interest are generally payable monthly or in monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. At December 31, 2005, our secured notes payable were secured by 486 properties with a combined net book value of $7,253.0 million.
     We have a secured revolving credit facility that provides for borrowings of up to $250 million primarily to be used for financing properties that we generally intend to hold for the intermediate term, as well as properties that are designated for redevelopment. In addition to the amounts in the above table, there were approximately $4 million and $10 million of notes that were provided through this facility that are obligations of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and not included within secured notes payable at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The interest rate on the notes provided through this facility is the Fannie Mae Discounted Mortgage-Backed Security index plus 0.85%, which interest rate resets monthly. Each such loan under this facility is treated as a separate borrowing and is collateralized by a specific property, and none of the loans is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted. This facility matures in September 2007, but can be terminated and repaid in full without penalty.
     Our consolidated debt instruments generally contain covenants common to the type of facility or borrowing, including financial covenants establishing minimum debt service coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios. At December 31, 2005, we were in material compliance with all financial covenants pertaining to our consolidated debt instruments.
     As of December 31, 2005, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our secured tax-exempt bonds and secured notes payable are as follows (in thousands):
 
NOTE 7  Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities
     In connection with the Insignia merger in 1998, we assumed the obligations under Trust Based Convertible Preferred Securities, which we refer to as TOPRS, with an aggregate liquidation amount of $149.5 million. Prior to 2005, approximately $134.5 million of these securities were converted, resulting in $15.0 million remaining as of December 31, 2004, which also represented the redemption value. On January 11, 2005, we redeemed for cash all outstanding TOPRS for a total redemption price of $50 per security, or $15.0 million, plus any accrued and unpaid distributions through the redemption date. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, $30,000, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of distributions have been recorded in interest expense.
NOTE 8  Term Loans and Credit Facility
     On November 2, 2004, we entered into an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement, with a syndicate of financial institutions. In addition to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and an Aimco subsidiary are also borrowers under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement replaced our previous two separate credit agreements.
     The Credit Agreement includes customary financial covenants, including the maintenance of specified ratios with respect to total indebtedness to gross asset value, total secured indebtedness to gross asset value, aggregate recourse indebtedness to gross asset value, variable rate debt to total indebtedness, debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage; the maintenance of a minimum adjusted tangible net worth; and limitations regarding the amount of cross-collateralized debt. The Credit Agreement includes other customary covenants, including a restriction on distributions and other restricted payments, but permits distributions during any four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount of up to 95% of our funds from operations for such period or such amount as may be necessary to maintain our REIT status. The Credit Agreement also permits us to repurchase our Common Stock using up to 80% of sales proceeds in any trailing four-quarter period.
     The original aggregate commitment under the Credit Agreement was $750 million, comprised of $450 million of revolving loan commitments and a $300 million term loan tranche. The revolving loans bear interest at a rate equal to (i) the LIBOR rate plus a margin that can range from 1.50% to 2.00% (for LIBOR loans) or (ii) the base rate plus a margin that can range from 0% to 0.25% (for base rate loans), in each case, depending on our leverage ratio. The original $300 million term loan bears interest at a rate equal to (i) the LIBOR rate plus 2.00% (for LIBOR loans) or (ii) the base rate plus 0.25% (for base rate loans). The default rate of interest for the loan is equal to the applicable rate described above plus 3%. The revolving loans mature on November 2, 2007, and the term loan matures on November 2, 2009.
     On June 16, 2005, we amended the Credit Agreement to provide for $100.0 million in additional term loan borrowings from a syndicate of financial institutions. The additional $100.0 million term loan matures on November 2, 2009 and bears interest at a rate of either LIBOR plus 1.75% or a base rate (determined by reference to the federal funds rate or Bank of America's prime rate) plus 0.25%. The proceeds from the additional term loan were used to repay outstanding revolving loans.
     The lenders under the Credit Agreement may accelerate any outstanding loans if, among other things: we fail to make payments when due (subject to applicable grace periods); material defaults occur under other debt agreements; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events occur; material judgments are entered against us; we fail to comply with certain covenants, such as the requirement to deliver financial information or the requirement to provide notices regarding material events (subject to applicable grace periods in some cases); indebtedness is incurred in violation of the covenants; or prohibited liens arise.
     At December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance of the term loans was $400.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.18%. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans was $217.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.26% (based on various weighted average LIBOR and base rate borrowings outstanding with various maturities). The amount available under the revolving facility at December 31, 2005 was $208.3 million (after giving effect to $24.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving facility). As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements.
 
NOTE 9  Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
     In connection with the Casden Transactions, we made commitments to:
     In connection with our redevelopment and capital improvement activities, we have commitments of approximately $99.6 million related to construction projects that are due to be completed by early 2007. Additionally, there are times we may enter into certain commitments for future purchases of goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
Tax Credit Syndication
     We are required to manage certain consolidated real estate partnerships in compliance with various laws, regulations and contractual provisions that apply to our syndication of historic and low-income housing tax credits. In some instances, noncompliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and require a refund or reduction of investor capital contributions, which are reported as minority interests in our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining compliance period for our tax credit syndication arrangements range from less than one year to 15 years. At December 31, 2005, we do not anticipate that any material refunds or reductions of investor capital contributions will be required in connection with these arrangements.
Legal Matters
     In addition to the matters described below, we are a party to various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which are covered by liability insurance, and none of which we expect to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
     Limited Partnerships
     In connection with our acquisitions of interests in real estate partnerships, we are sometimes subject to legal actions, including allegations that such activities may involve breaches of fiduciary duties to the partners of such real estate partnerships or violations of the relevant partnership agreements. We may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of such litigation. We believe that we comply with our fiduciary obligations and relevant partnership agreements. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not expect any such legal actions to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
     Environmental
     Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain hazardous substances present on a property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous substances. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remedy properly, hazardous substances may adversely affect occupancy at affected apartment communities and the ability to sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by government agencies, and potential fines or penalties imposed by such agencies in connection therewith, the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal, remediation or disposal of hazardous substances through a licensed disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever
 
owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of properties, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our properties or properties we acquire or manage in the future.
     We have determined that our legal obligations to remove or remediate hazardous substances may be conditional asset retirement obligations as defined in FIN 47. Except in limited circumstances where the asset retirement activities are expected to be performed in connection with a planned construction project or property casualty, we believe that the fair value of our asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated due to significant uncertainties in the timing and manner of settlement of those obligations. Asset retirement obligations that are reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2005 are immaterial to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
     Mold
     We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits that have alleged personal injury and property damage as a result of the presence of mold. In addition, we are aware of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold, some of which have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage loss claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure. We have implemented policies, procedures, third-party audits and training, and include a detailed moisture intrusion and mold assessment during acquisition due diligence. We believe these measures will prevent or eliminate mold exposure from our properties and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. Because the law regarding mold is unsettled and subject to change we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
     Unclaimed Property and Use Taxes
     Based on inquiries from several states, we are reviewing our historic forfeiture of unclaimed property pursuant to applicable state and local laws. We are also reviewing our historic filing of use tax returns in certain state and local jurisdictions that impose such taxes. At this time, we do not have sufficient information available to determine the extent or potential effect of any non-compliance on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
     National Union Litigation
     National Program Services, Inc. and Vito Gruppuso (collectively "NPS") were insurance agents who sold to us property insurance issued by National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ("National Union"). The financial failure of NPS resulted in defaults under two agreements by which NPS indemnified us from losses relating to the matters described below. As a result of such defaults, we had a $16.7 million insurance-related receivable that was subsequently reduced to $6.7 million following our settlement with Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company ("Lumbermens") and an insurance agency. In addition, we have pending litigation against National Union, First Capital Group, a New York based insurance wholesaler, NPS and other agents of National Union, for a refund of at least $10 million of the prepaid premium plus other damages. Trial is set for May 30, 2006. The contingent liabilities arising from the NPS defaults also resulted in litigation against us by Cananwill, Inc. ("Cananwill"), a premium funding company, regarding an alleged balance due of $5.7 million on a premium finance agreement that funded premium payments made to National Union. We are also plaintiffs in litigation against Cananwill and Combined Specialty Insurance Company, formerly known as Virginia Surety Company, Inc., alleging Cananwill's conversion of $1.6 million of unearned premium belonging to us and misapplication of such funds to the alleged debt asserted in the lawsuit initiated by Cananwill. The matter in which we are plaintiffs has been stayed by the court pending resolution of the action filed by Cananwill against us. The previously disclosed litigation brought by WestRM  West Risk Markets, Ltd. ("WestRM") against XL Reinsurance America, Inc. ("XL"), Greenwich Insurance Company ("Greenwich") and Lumbermens in which we have been made a third party defendant continues. Summary judgment has been entered against defendants XL and Greenwich. Similarly, the previously disclosed litigation brought by Highlands Insurance Company ("Highlands") against Cananwill, XL, Greenwich and us also continues. In those cases in which we are a defendant, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to assert, and we will vigorously defend ourselves against claims brought against us. In addition, we will vigorously prosecute our own claims. Although the outcome of any claim or matter in litigation is uncertain, we do not believe that we will incur any material loss in connection with the insurance-related receivable or that the ultimate outcome of these separate but related matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
 
     FLSA Litigation
     The Aimco Operating Partnership and NHP Management Company ("NHPMN"), our subsidiary, are defendants in a lawsuit alleging that they willfully violated the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA") by failing to pay maintenance workers overtime for all hours worked in excess of forty per week. The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, attempts to bring a collective action under the FLSA and seeks to certify state subclasses in California, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the Aimco Operating Partnership and NHPMN failed to compensate maintenance workers for time that they were required to be "on-call." Additionally, the complaint alleges the Aimco Operating Partnership and NHPMN failed to comply with the FLSA in compensating maintenance workers for time that they worked in excess of 40 hours in a week. In June 2005, the court conditionally certified the collective action on both the on-call and overtime issues, which allows the plaintiffs to provide notice of the collective action to all non-exempt maintenance workers from August 7, 2000 through the present. Notices have been sent out to all current and former hourly maintenance workers. The opt-in period has not yet closed. When it does, the Aimco Operating Partnership and NHPMN will have the opportunity to move to decertify the collective action. Because the court denied plaintiffs' motion to certify state subclasses, on September 26, 2005, the plaintiffs filed a class action with the same allegations in the Superior Court of California (Contra Costa County), and on November 5, 2005 in Montgomery County Maryland Circuit Court. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
     SEC Investigation
     The Central Regional Office (the "Regional Office") of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") conducted a formal investigation relating to certain matters. We believe the areas of investigation included our miscalculated monthly net rental income figures in third quarter 2003, forecasted guidance, accounts payable, rent concessions, vendor rebates, capitalization of payroll and certain other costs, and tax credit transactions. On December 19, 2005, we announced that the Regional Office informed us that its investigation has been recommended for termination and no enforcement action has been recommended to the Commission.
Operating Leases
     We are obligated under office space and equipment non-cancelable operating leases. In addition, we sublease certain of our office space to tenants under non-cancelable subleases. Approximate minimum annual rentals under operating leases and approximate minimum payments to be received under annual subleases are as follows (in thousands):
     Substantially all of the office space and equipment subject to the operating leases described above are for the use of our corporate offices and regional operating centers. Rent expense recognized totaled $7.4 million, $5.8 million, and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sublease receipts that offset rent expense totaled approximately $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
 
NOTE 10  Income Taxes
     Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the taxable REIT subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows (in thousands):
     During the year ended December 31, 2005, we identified approximately $12.2 million in previously unrecorded net deferred tax assets that were acquired in connection with business combinations in prior years. We recorded adjustments to recognize these net assets and reduce goodwill and real estate acquired in the corresponding business combinations by $6.2 million and $6.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we maintained a $1.9 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets primarily related to alternative minimum tax credits totaling approximately $1.9 million. At December 31, 2004, we also maintained a $1.2 million valuation allowance for certain low-income housing credits and rehabilitation credits. That allowance was reversed in 2005 based on our determination that it is more likely than not that the credits will be realized.
     Significant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows and are classified within other expenses (income), net in continuing operations and income from discontinued operations, net in our statements of income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands):
     Consolidated income (loss) subject to tax, consisting of pretax income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries and gains on certain property sales that are subject to income tax under section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code, is $(36.9) million
 
for 2005, $20.5 million for 2004, and $(4.0) million for 2003. The reconciliation of income tax attributable to continuing and discontinued operations computed at the U.S. statutory rate to income tax expense (benefit) is shown below (dollars in thousands):
     During the quarter ended March 31, 2003, in an effort to streamline business processes and operational efficiencies of our property management and services businesses, we contributed all of the capital stock of NHP Management Company to AIMCO/Bethesda Holdings, Inc. (both of which are wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries). In connection with this transaction, we reversed a valuation allowance related to future deductions and tax loss carryforwards of NHP Management Company and thereby recognized approximately $8.0 million of deferred tax benefits within other expenses (income), net. This deferred tax benefit increased net income by approximately $7.1 million, net of minority interest, and resulted in an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.08 for the year ended December 31, 2003.
     Income taxes paid totaled approximately $4.8 million, $2.7 million, and $3.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     At December 31, 2005, we had net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) of approximately $87.0 million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2020 to 2023. Subject to certain separate return limitations, we may use these NOLs to offset all or a portion of taxable income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, we had low income housing and rehabilitation tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6.0 million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2012 to 2024.
     For income tax purposes, dividends paid to holders of Common Stock primarily consist of ordinary income, return of capital, capital gains, qualified dividends and unrecaptured Sec. 1250 gains, or a combination thereof. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, dividends per share held for the entire year were estimated to be taxable as follows:
 
 
NOTE 11  Transactions Involving Minority Interest in Aimco Operating Partnership
Preferred OP Units
     Various classes of preferred OP Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership are outstanding. Depending on the terms of each class, these preferred OP Units are convertible into common OP Units or redeemable for Common Stock and are paid distributions varying from 5.9% to 9.6% per annum per unit, or equal to the dividends paid on Common Stock based on the conversion terms. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 3.3 million preferred OP Units were outstanding with a redemption value of $90.2 million, which were redeemable into approximately 2.4 million shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2004, a total of 3.3 million preferred OP Units were outstanding with a redemption value of $90.5 million, which were redeemable into approximately 2.5 million shares of Common Stock.
     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 1,700 and 10,400 preferred OP Units were tendered for redemption in exchange for approximately 1,100 and 7,900 shares of Common Stock, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were approximately 12,800 and 1,600 preferred OP Units tendered for redemption in exchange for cash, respectively.
Common OP Units
     We completed tender offers for limited partnership interests resulting in the issuance of approximately 3,000 and 82,000 common OP Units in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
     During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 77,000 and 160,000 common OP Units, respectively, were redeemed in exchange for cash, and approximately 425,000 and 735,000 common OP Units, respectively, were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock.
High Performance Partnership Units
     As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were 2,379,084 Class I High Performance Partnership Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding. Also outstanding were 5,000 Class VI High Performance Partnership Units, or the Class VI Units, for which the valuation period began on January 1, 2003 and ended on December 31, 2005, 4,109 Class VII High Performance Partnership Units, or the Class VII Units, for which the valuation period began on January 1, 2004 and will end on December 31, 2006 and 5,000 Class VIII High Performance Partnership Units, or the Class VIII Units, for which the valuation period began on January 1, 2005 and will end on December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2005, we did not meet the required measurement benchmarks for the Class VI Units, Class VII Units or Class VIII Units and, therefore, we have not recorded any additional minority interest in Aimco Operating Partnership for such High Performance Partnership Units in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005 and such High Performance Partnership Units have no dilutive effect.
 
NOTE 12  Stockholders' Equity
Preferred Stock
     At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had the following classes of preferred stock outstanding classified as equity:
 
     All classes of preferred stock are pari passu with each other and are senior to Common Stock. The holders of each
 
class of preferred stock are generally not entitled to vote on matters submitted to stockholders. Dividends on all shares of preferred stock are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. All of the above outstanding classes of preferred stock have a liquidation preference per share of $25, with the exception of the Class W Preferred Stock, which has a liquidation preference per share of $52.50.
     The dividends paid on each class of preferred stock classified as equity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
 
 
Common Stock
     During 2005 and 2004, we issued approximately 37,000 shares and 45,000 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to certain non-executive officers at market prices. In exchange for the shares purchased, the officers executed notes payable totaling $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. These notes, which are 25% recourse to the borrowers, have a 10-year maturity and bear interest either at a fixed rate of 6% annually or a floating rate based on the one-month LIBOR plus 3.85%, which is subject to an annual interest rate cap of typically 7.25%. Total payments on such notes from officers in 2005 and 2004 were $12.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively.
     In addition, in 2005 and 2004, we issued approximately 393,000 and 532,000 restricted shares of Common Stock, respectively, to certain officers and employees. The restricted stock was recorded at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of issuance. These shares of restricted Common Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and are subject to a risk of forfeiture prior to the expiration of the applicable vesting period (typically ratably over a period of three or five years). Certain shares of restricted stock issued during 2005 are subject to accelerated vesting upon the achievement of a specified calendar year performance measure target. As of December 31, 2005, achievement of the specified target is not considered probable.
     There were no shares of stock repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2005. On February 18, 19 and 24, 2004, we purchased on the open market 30,000, 60,000 and 20,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at an average price per share of approximately $32.03, $32.17 and $31.26, respectively. Additionally, on February 24, 2004, we completed the purchase of 287,272 shares of Common Stock in a privately negotiated transaction at a price of $31.60 per share.
Registration Statements
     As of December 31, 2005, under our shelf registration statement, which was declared effective in April 2004, we had available for issuance approximately $876.6 million of debt and equity securities, and the Aimco Operating Partnership had available for issuance $500.0 million of debt securities.
NOTE 13  Employee Benefit and Stock Plans
401K Plan
     We provide a 401(k) defined-contribution employee savings plan. Employees who have completed 30 days of service and are age 18 or older are eligible to participate. Our matching contributions are made in the following manner: (1) a 100% match on the first 3% of the participant's contribution; (2) a 50% match on the next 2% of the participant's contribution. We incurred costs in connection with this plan of approximately $4.1 million, $3.2 million and $2.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Stock Award and Incentive Plan and Stock Warrants
     We adopted the Apartment Investment and Management Company 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, or the 1997 Plan to attract and retain officers, key employees and independent directors. The 1997 Plan reserves for issuance a maximum of 20,000,000 shares, which may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, or other types of awards as authorized under the 1997 Plan. At December 31, 2005, there were approximately 4,200,000 shares available for issuance. The 1997 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. In the case of incentive stock options, the exercise price of the options granted may not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant. The term of the incentive and non-qualified options is ten years from the date of grant. The options typically vest over a period of one to five years from the date of grant. Terms may be modified at the discretion of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors.
     The 1997 Plan also authorizes grants of restricted stock awards as part of our equity compensation plan. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we granted restricted stock awards of approximately 393,000, 532,000 and 235,000 shares, respectively, with weighted average fair values per share of $38.46, $29.56, and $38.09, respectively. Compensation cost related to these awards is being recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period (typically three or five years). Dividends paid on restricted stock awards (whether vested or unvested) are charged to distributions in excess of earnings. We evaluate quarterly the previously paid dividends on restricted stock awards that are forfeited to determine whether a reclassification between distributions in excess of earnings and compensation expense should be recorded. Dividends paid on restricted stock awards that were forfeited were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
 
     On December 2, 1997, we issued warrants, which we refer to as the Oxford Warrants, exercisable through December 31, 2006 to purchase up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $41 per share. The Oxford Warrants were issued to affiliates of Oxford Realty Financial Group, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or Oxford, in connection with the amendment of certain agreements pursuant to which we manage properties formerly controlled by Oxford or its affiliates. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we purchased from the holders thereof all outstanding Oxford Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $1.05 million, which was determined to be fair value.
     The following table summarizes the option and warrant activity for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands, except price data):
     As of December 31, 2005, outstanding and exercisable options have the following ranges of exercise prices and remaining weighted average contractual terms (in thousands, except for price data):
 
NOTE 14  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale
     In accordance with SFAS 144 we report as discontinued operations real estate assets that meet the definition of a component of an entity and have been sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale under SFAS 144. We included all results of these discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes, in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of income under the heading "discontinued operations." This treatment resulted in certain reclassifications of 2004 and 2003 financial statement amounts.
     At December 31, 2005, we had 45 properties with an aggregate of 10,550 units classified as held for sale. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, discontinued operations includes the results of operations of these properties. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we sold 83 properties with an aggregate of 16,835 units and our interest in one partnership. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, discontinued operations includes the results of operations of these 83 properties and one partnership for periods prior to the date of sale. During 2004, we sold 54 properties with an aggregate of 12,248 units. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, discontinued operations includes the results of operations of these 54 properties for periods prior to the date of sale. During 2003, we sold 72 properties with an aggregate of 18,291 units. For the year ended December 31, 2003, discontinued operations includes the results of operations of these 72 properties for periods prior to the date of sale.
     The following is a summary of the components of income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (dollars in thousands):
     We are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. We expect that all properties classified as held for sale will sell within one year from the date classified as held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale of $418.9 million at December 31, 2005 include real estate net book value of $413.4 million and restricted cash and other assets of $5.5 million. Liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale of $267.9 million at December 31, 2005 include mortgage debt of $260.6 million. Assets classified as held for sale of $975.6 million at December 31, 2004 include real estate net book value of $961.9 million and restricted cash and other assets of $13.7 million, represented by 128 properties with 27,385 units that were classified as assets held for sale during 2004 and 2005. Liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale of $644.8 million at December 31, 2004 include mortgage debt of $636.6 million. The estimated proceeds, less anticipated costs to sell, for certain of these assets were less than the related net book value, and therefore we recorded impairment losses of $3.8 million, $7.3 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We are also marketing for sale certain other properties that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
 
     
NOTE 15  Earnings per Share
     We calculate earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, common stock equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period. The following table illustrates the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in thousands, except per share data):
     The Class W Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and the Class X Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible into Common Stock (see Note 12). All of our convertible preferred stock is anti-dilutive on an "as converted" basis. Therefore, we deduct all of the dividends payable on the convertible preferred stock to arrive at the numerator and no additional shares are included in the denominator when calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share. We have excluded from diluted earnings per share the common share equivalents related to approximately 12.6 million, 12.4 million and 11.8 million of vested and unvested stock options, shares issued for non-recourse notes receivable, and restricted stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, we treat the dilutive impact of the unvested portion of restricted shares as common stock equivalents.
Earnings per Share,
 
NOTE 16  Unaudited Summarized Consolidated Quarterly Information
     Summarized unaudited consolidated quarterly information for 2005 and 2004 is provided below (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts).
 
 
NOTE 17  Business Segments
     We have two reportable segments: real estate (owning and operating apartments) and investment management business (providing property management and other services relating to the apartment business to third parties and affiliates). We own and operate properties throughout the United States and Puerto Rico that generate rental and other property related income through the leasing of apartment units to a diverse base of residents. We separately evaluate the performance of each of our properties. However, because each of our properties has similar economic characteristics, the properties have been aggregated into a single apartment communities, or real estate, segment. All real estate revenues are from external customers and no revenues are generated from transactions with other segments. No single resident or related group of residents contributed 10% or more of total revenues during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003.
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, , or SFAS 131, requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing such segments' performance. Our chief operating decision maker is comprised of several members of our executive management team who use several generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance of the business including net operating income, free cash flow, funds from operations, and adjusted funds from operations. In 2005 and 2004, the chief operating decision maker emphasized net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Accordingly, below we disclose net operating income for each of our segments. Net operating income is defined as segment revenues (after the elimination of intersegment revenues) less direct segment operating expenses. In 2003, we reported free cash flow as the primary basis for measurement of segment profit or loss. Certain reclassifications have been made to 2004 and 2003 amounts to conform to the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications primarily represent presentation changes related to discontinued operations.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
     The following table presents revenues and net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, from these segments, and reconciles net operating income of reportable segments to operating income as reported (in thousands):
 
 
     Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the real estate segment and totaled $443.9 million, $301.9 million and $245.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
NOTE 18  Transactions with Affiliates
     We earn revenue from affiliated real estate partnerships. These revenues include fees for property management services, partnership and asset management services, risk management services and transactional services such as syndication and acquisition, development, refinancing, construction supervisory and disposition. In addition, we are reimbursed for our costs in connection with the management of the unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These fees and reimbursements for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled $73.6 million, $89.6 million and $93.1 million, respectively. The total accounts receivable due from affiliates was $43.1 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.7 million, at December 31, 2005, and $39.2 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $4.4 million, at December 31, 2004.
     Additionally, we earn interest income on notes from real estate partnerships in which we are the general partner and hold either par value or discounted notes. Interest income earned on par value notes from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $17.4 million, $16.8 million, and $14.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accretion income earned on discounted notes from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $0.7 million, $6.2 million, and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information on notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
NOTE 19  Recent Accounting Developments
     In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), , or SFAS 123R, which supersedes the existing SFAS 123, which we adopted in 2003 using the prospective method of transition as described therein. SFAS 123R requires all share-based employee compensation, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value and requires a modified prospective application method of adoption. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS 123R will be applied prospectively to new and modified awards granted on or after the required effective date. In addition, compensation cost is required to be recognized over the remaining vesting period for the unvested portion of outstanding awards granted prior to the effective date. The measurement and recognition provisions of SFAS 123R that apply to our stock option plans are similar to those currently being followed by us for awards granted on or after January 1, 2003. The primary change in expense recognition requirements, which also applies to our unvested restricted stock awards, relates to the treatment of forfeitures. Under SFAS 123R, expected forfeitures are required to be estimated in determining periodic compensation cost, whereas we currently recognize forfeitures as they occur. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we will estimate forfeitures of unvested awards of stock options and restricted stock and record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the compensation expense that would not have been recognized in prior periods had forfeitures been estimated prior to the date of adoption. We are required to adopt SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. Upon adoption, our periodic compensation cost will increase over the remaining vesting period for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2003, for which no cost is currently being recognized. Based on preliminary estimates of such additional compensation cost, we do not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Share-Based Payment
 
     In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, or SFAS 154, which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 3, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, although early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date SFAS 154 was issued. We do not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,
     As discussed under in Note 2, we applied EITF 04-5 after June 29, 2005 to newly formed limited partnerships and to existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreement was modified. EITF 04-5 is effective on January 1, 2006 for general partners in all other limited partnerships. We are analyzing the effects of EITF 04-5 on our investments in limited partnerships where we are a general partner and have tentatively identified certain unconsolidated partnerships that will be consolidated upon adoption of EITF 04-5. We plan to adopt EITF 04-5 using a transition method that does not involve retrospective application, but potentially involves an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle. A charge to opening retained earnings will be required if we consolidate partnerships with deficits in partners' equity that we were not required to recognize using the equity method of accounting for our investments in such partnerships. After adoption, we may be required to recognize losses for deficit distributions to minority partners in newly consolidated partnerships that would not be recognized using the equity method. We have not yet fully determined the effects that the adoption of EITF 04-5 will have on our financial condition or results of operations, but we anticipate that it will result in consolidation of additional partnerships.
Principles of Consolidation
NOTE 20  Subsequent Events
Redemption of Class Q Cumulative Preferred Stock
     On February 17, 2006, we announced that we would redeem for cash all 2.53 million outstanding shares of 10.10% Class Q Cumulative Preferred Stock on March 19, 2006. The total redemption price of $25.035 per share, or $63.3 million, includes the redemption price of $25.00 per share and $0.035 per share of accumulated and unpaid dividends through March 19, 2006.
Sale of a Portion of the Flamingo South Beach Property
     On February 17, 2006, we closed the sale of a portion of the Flamingo South Beach property known as the South Tower. The South Tower sale price was $163.5 million and included 562 residential units and our rights to the property's marina. Additionally, the buyer paid non-refundable funds of $5 million for the option to purchase the 614-unit North Tower for $169 million between September 1, 2006 and February 28, 2007 (subject to the right to extend for up to six months subject to certain conditions), and the option to purchase the 513-unit Central Tower, along with the remainder of improvements on the property, for $267.5 million between December 1, 2007 and May 31, 2008 (subject to the right to extend for up to four months subject to certain conditions and provided that the buyer has previously purchased the North Tower). The sales agreement also provides us with profit participation if certain thresholds are met. We will receive, through one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, the first $19.8 million in proceeds in the proposed condominium conversion after certain development fees and certain returns on the buyer's equity have been achieved, plus 20% of the buyer's net profits thereafter. At December 31, 2005, the South Tower had a net book value of approximately $80 million and related property debt of approximately $77 million.
