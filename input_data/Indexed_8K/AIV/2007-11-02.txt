Diluted Per Share Results

Management Comments
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco's property operations team achieved solid results with same-store occupancy of 94.8%, year-over-year revenue growth of 4.2% and NOI growth of 4.9%. Most of our markets performed well and met our expectations; however, Florida was softer than we had anticipated. Our redevelopment team currently has 53 conventional projects underway and is on track to invest a total of $300 million dollars in conventional redevelopment projects in 2007 and a similar amount next year."
Chief Financial Officer Tom Herzog adds: "Third quarter FFO of $0.86 per share was $0.04 above the mid-point of guidance due primarily to higher transaction income partially offset by lower than expected Same Store net operating income. We are establishing fourth quarter FFO guidance of $0.89 to $0.95 per share and increasing our full year FFO guidance from a range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share to a range of $3.37 to $3.43 per share. At the mid-point of guidance, this represents a 10% increase over 2006. Full year FFO guidance contemplates Same Store net operating income growth of 4.75% to 5.25%, which is a reduction from the previous range of 5.5% to 6.5%."
Property Operations
Conventional Real Estate Operations
Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of market rate properties in the United States. Conventional real estate operations consist of Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities. At the end of the third quarter 2007, this portfolio included 446 properties with 129,199 units in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 88%. During the third quarter 2007, conventional real estate operations generated net operating income of $178.3 million.
"Same Store" Results
The Same Store portfolio is a sub-set of total conventional properties (see the Glossary). In the third quarter 2007, the Same Store portfolio included 360 communities with 94,177 Effective Units (see the Glossary) based on Aimco's weighted average ownership of 88% (See Supplemental Schedules 6a through 7).
Comparing Same Store results in the third quarter 2007 with the third quarter 2006, total revenue increased $10.5 million, or 4.2%. The increase in revenue was primarily generated by higher average rent, up $27 per unit, or 3.2%, from $850 per unit to $877 per unit, higher occupancy, which was up 0.4% from 94.4% to 94.8%, and increased utility reimbursements, up $1.4 million. Same Store expenses of $108.3 million increased $3.4 million, or 3.2%, compared with the prior year period as a result of higher taxes, utilities, marketing and payroll. Same Store portfolio net operating income was $150.8 million for the third quarter 2007, up 4.9% from the third quarter 2006.
Same Store Operating Results
 
Comparing Same Store results on a sequential basis, total revenue increased $1.4 million in the third quarter 2007 compared with the second quarter of 2007, driven by a $10 per unit increase in average rental rates and an increase in occupancy of 0.1%. Expenses increased $2.0 million, or 1.9%, primarily due to higher turnover, payroll, marketing and taxes and insurance, offset by lower repairs and maintenance and utilities. Net operating income decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, on a sequential basis.
Affordable Real Estate Operations
Aimco is among the largest owners and operators of affordable properties in the United States. At the end of the third quarter 2007, Aimco's owned affordable portfolio included 315 properties with 36,685 units in which Aimco had an average ownership of 52%. During the third quarter 2007, affordable property operations generated net operating income of $20.9 million. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter average month-end occupancy for the affordable portfolio decreased 60 basis points from 97.2% to 96.6%, and average rent per unit increased 3.0% from $723 to $745 per unit.
Aimco Capital
Aimco Capital oversees Aimco's asset management, transaction and portfolio management activities, and is led by a management team dedicated to this business.
Asset Management and Transactions
Asset management income is earned from the financial management of partnerships. Transaction income is earned from activities such as tax credit syndications, dispositions, refinancings and land sales. Proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of tax credits are recognized ratably as the tax benefits are delivered, and syndication fees are recognized upon completion of tax credit syndications. Consolidated asset management and transaction net operating income, net of tax, was $15.4 million in the third quarter 2007, up 45% when compared to $10.6 million in the third quarter 2006. See Supplemental Schedule 11 for additional information on asset management and transaction income.
Portfolio Management
ACQUISITIONS  During the third quarter 2007, Aimco acquired The Acres Apartments with 118 units, located in North San Diego, California, for $19.3 million, or $163,136 per unit.
DISPOSITIONS  Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria. In the third quarter 2007, Aimco sold nine non-core conventional properties and seven affordable properties with 2,133 and 659 units, respectively, for $106.4 million in gross proceeds (Aimco share $50.1 million). Aimco's share of net proceeds after repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $25.9 million.
In connection with the 2006 sale of the Flamingo South Tower in Miami, Florida, Aimco and the buyer entered into an agreement under which the buyer paid a total of $6.0 million in non-refundable fees for the option to purchase the North and Central Towers. The option agreement was terminated during the third quarter 2007 and, as a result, Aimco has no further obligation to the buyer with respect to the sale of the North and Central Towers. Accordingly, Aimco recognized income of $5.5 million, net of tax, during the third quarter 2007.
Aimco's property dispositions resulted in gains on dispositions of real estate (including gains on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other and gains within discontinued operations), of $23.2 million for the third quarter 2007 (including the Flamingo North and Central Tower option income described above), compared with gains of $19.2 million for the third quarter 2006.
See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on acquisition and disposition activity.
 
Redevelopment
Aimco actively reinvests in and upgrades its portfolio through property redevelopments. At the end of the third quarter 2007, Aimco had 53 active conventional redevelopment projects and 12 active tax credit redevelopment projects. Aimco's share of total redevelopment expenditures was $95.9 million during the third quarter 2007. Conventional redevelopment project expenditures totaled $78.4 million and tax credit redevelopment project expenditures totaled $17.5 million for the quarter. Further information on redevelopment projects is provided in Supplemental Schedule 10.
Additional Financial Information
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INCOME  Income from property management is generated when Aimco provides property management services to properties with unaffiliated partners. Income from consolidated properties is eliminated in Aimco's consolidated GAAP financial statements and the related economic benefit is reflected in minority interest.
INTEREST INCOME  Consolidated interest income was $9.9 million for the third quarter 2007 compared with $7.4 million for the third quarter 2006. Interest income is earned in part from money market and interest bearing accounts as well as on notes receivable from unconsolidated partnerships and non-affiliates.
DEBT ACTIVITY  During the third quarter 2007, Aimco closed 59 property loans generating gross proceeds of $600.3 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.26%. This included refinancing $297.6 million in existing mortgage loans, reducing the average interest rate from 6.64% to 6.43%. After repayment of existing property debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $258.3 million.
During the third quarter 2007, we amended our corporate credit agreement to increase our revolving debt capacity by $200.0 million with the same maturity and pricing terms as the existing $450.0 million revolving credit facility. The amendment also provided for an additional $75.0 million term loan that bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.375%, which is 12.5 basis points less than the existing $400.0 million term loan. The $75.0 million term loan matures on September 14, 2008 with an option to extend the maturity date to September 14, 2009. The proceeds from the additional term loan were used to repay outstanding revolving loans. At quarter-end, Aimco's corporate debt balance was $550.0 million, up from $540.0 million at year-end 2006, and carried a weighted average interest rate of 6.93%. The balance on Aimco's revolving credit facility was $75.0 million and total dry powder at quarter end was more than $600.0 million.
As of September 30, 2007, Aimco had $7.3 billion of consolidated debt outstanding (excluding other borrowings), of which $5.6 billion was fixed rate mortgage debt and $1.7 billion was floating rate debt. The floating rate debt included $550.0 million of corporate debt, $704.6 million of tax-exempt bonds, and $485.5 million of other property loans. In addition, Aimco had $100.0 million of floating rate preferred stock. Aimco's FFO exposure to changes in floating interest rates is mitigated by tax-exempt bonds with rates tied to the Bond Market Association Index which moves at approximately 0.68% for a 1.00% change in LIBOR. Exposure is further offset by floating rate assets, such as cash and notes receivable, and interest capitalized on entitlement and redevelopment properties. Based on Aimco's proportionate share of quarter-end balances (see Supplemental Schedule 3), Aimco estimates its sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in LIBOR to be approximately $0.02 per share per quarter. Other borrowings of $65.0 million at quarter-end consisted primarily of unsecured notes payable and obligations under sale and leaseback arrangements accounted for as financings. As of September 30, 2007, other borrowings included $56.5 million of fixed rate obligations with interest rates ranging from zero to 10.00%, and $8.5 million of variable rate obligations bearing interest at the prime rate plus 1.75%.
See Supplemental Schedule 5 for more detail on debt characteristics and activity.
INTEREST EXPENSE  Consolidated interest expense was $106.7 million for the third quarter 2007 compared with $100.2 million for the third quarter 2006. The $6.5 million increase in interest expense is the result of higher balances on property debt, offset by lower weighted average interest rates and higher capitalized interest.
 
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  During the third quarter 2007, Aimco repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of its Class A Common Stock at an average price of $41.71 per share for a total cost of $49.1 million, bringing year-to-date 2007 common stock repurchases to 3.4 million shares at an average price of $51.27 per share for a total cost of $175.4 million. We are currently authorized to repurchase approximately 12.3 million additional shares. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
On September 30, 2007, Aimco redeemed the 1,904,762 outstanding shares of its privately held 8.1% Class W Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. The aggregate redemption price of $104.0 million included a redemption price per share of $53.55 (102% of the $52.50 per share liquidation preference) plus approximately $1.06 per share of accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date.
G&A  General and administrative expenses for the third quarter 2007 of $20.2 million decreased $3.1 million or 13% when compared with the third quarter 2006. The year-over-year decrease in G&A was primarily due to lower compensation costs and related expenses.
Outlook
For the fourth quarter 2007, FFO is expected to be in a range from $0.89 to $0.95 per share, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, and we are increasing our full year FFO guidance from a range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share to a range of $3.37 to $3.43 per share. The full year 2007 AFFO outlook of greater than $2.40 per share is unchanged. Please refer to the Outlook Schedule, which follows the Consolidated Financial Statements in this release, for more detail on fourth quarter and full year 2007 guidance.
Dividends on Common Stock
As announced on October 30, 2007, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, payable on November 30, 2007, to stockholders of record on November 16, 2007. Class A Common Stock cash dividends declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 totaled $1.80 per share, or 97% of AFFO (undiluted) and 73% of FFO (diluted), on a per share basis. Year-to-date dividends represent a 5.3% annualized yield based on the $45.13 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on September 28, 2007.

Outlook and Forward Looking Statement Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2007 (unaudited)
This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding projected results and specifically forecasts of fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. These forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date and include certain risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Aimco's ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rent levels and Same Store results and Aimco's ability to close transactions necessary to generate transactional income as anticipated.
Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors that are beyond the control of Aimco including, without limitation: natural disasters such as hurricanes; national and local economic conditions; the general level of interest rates; energy costs; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which Aimco operates; financing risks, including the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in local markets and competition for tenants in such markets; insurance risk; acquisition and development risks, including failure of such acquisitions to perform in accordance with projections; the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by Aimco.
Readers should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and notes thereto, as well as the risk factors described in Aimco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements reflect management's judgment as of this date, and Aimco assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect future events or circumstances.
[1] Aimco's earnings per share guidance does not include estimates for (i) fourth quarter gains on dispositions or impairment losses due to the unpredictable timing of transactions, or (ii) fourth quarter gains or losses on early repayment of debt.
[2] FFO per share represents FFO before impairment charges and preferred stock redemption related charges. Impairments and redemption related preferred stock charges were $0.03 per share year to date 2007. No preferred stock redemption related charges are projected to occur in the fourth quarter.
[3] Outlook for AFFO is provided on an annual basis.
[4] Aimco anticipates gross sales proceeds of $500 to $600 million for 2007 ($400 to $450 million related to conventional properties and $100 to $150 million related to affordable properties). Aimco share of proceeds is expected to be $300 to $350 million ($225 to $250 million related to conventional properties and $75 to $100 million related to affordable properties). Aimco estimates that its share of cash from these dispositions, net of mortgage debt and third-party equity interests, will be $150 to $175 million ($125 to $145 million related to conventional properties and $25 to $30 million related to affordable properties).
[5] Gross acquisitions include property acquisitions, limited partnership acquisitions and repurchase of Aimco stock.
 
 
 
Supplemental Schedule 1
Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited)
 
Supplemental Schedule 1 (continued)
Notes to Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations
[1] Represents the numerator for calculating basic earnings per common share in accordance with GAAP.
[2] Includes amortization of management contracts where Aimco is the general partner. Such management contracts were established in certain instances where Aimco acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership. Because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships, Aimco believes it is consistent with NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper to add back such amortization, as the White Paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry.
[3] "Minority partners' interests" means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships.
[4] In accordance with GAAP, deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in Aimco's income statement when cash is distributed to a non-controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partner's capital account, which is classified as minority interest on the balance sheet. Aimco records these charges for GAAP purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost. Deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value. As a result, the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents, in substance, either (1) recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non-controlling partner or (2) a payment related to the non-controlling partner's share of real estate appreciation. Based on NAREIT's White Paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from FFO, Aimco adds back deficit distributions and subtracts related recoveries in its reconciliation of net income to FFO.
[5] On October 1, 2003, NAREIT clarified its definition of FFO to include impairment losses, which previously had been added back to calculate FFO. Although Aimco's presentation conforms with the NAREIT definition, Aimco considers such approach to be inconsistent with the treatment of gains on dispositions of real estate, which are not included in FFO. Aimco no longer adds back impairment losses when computing FFO in accordance with this clarification. FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 includes impairment losses of $0.8 million and recoveries of impairment losses of $0.9 million, respectively.
[6] In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's July 31, 2003 interpretation of the Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, Aimco includes preferred stock redemption related costs in FFO. As a result, FFO for the three months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 includes redemption premiums and issuance costs of $2.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively; and for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, includes redemption premiums and issuance costs of $2.6 million and $6.8 million, repsectively.
[7] Represents the denominator for calculating Aimco's diluted earnings per common share in accordance with GAAP plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for FFO or AFFO.

Notes to Schedule 2:
[1] See definitions and descriptions in Glossary.
[2] Same store amounts in this schedule may differ from the same store amounts in Schedule 6. Any such differences are the result of (a) certain variations in the treatment of intercompany eliminations in GAAP versus non-GAAP measures; (b) the effect of changing ownership percentages over time due to Aimco's acquisition of additional partnership interests and (c) the elimination of non-recurring and comparability items that if included in Schedule 6 would distort Schedule 6 same store results.
[3] Property management revenues reported in Aimco's GAAP income statement reflect fees charged to unconsolidated properties. Property management revenues reported in the proportionate income statement reflect the minority partners' share of fees charged to both consolidated and unconsolidated properties.
[4] Property management expenses reported on this line in Aimco's GAAP income statement reflect expenses related to the management of consolidated properties. Property management expenses reported on this line in the proportionate income statement reflect Aimco's share of both consolidated and unconsolidated property management expenses.
[5] Property management expenses reported on this line in Aimco's GAAP income statement reflect expenses related to the management of unconsolidated properties. Property management expenses reported on this line in the proportionate income statement reflect minority partners' share of both consolidated and unconsolidated property management expenses.

Capital Expenditures
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2007
(in thousands, except per unit data) (unaudited)
All capital spending is classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI"), casualties, redevelopment or entitlement. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.

GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES: Properties that have not reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less Capital Replacement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for preferred stock redemption related costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco Operating Partnership's share. Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for AFFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES: Affordable properties benefit from government programs designed to pay rental income on behalf of people with low or moderate incomes and includes properties that were owned for all periods presented.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI expenditures include all non-redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CI expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statements of Cash Flows.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): CR expenditures do not increase the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. They represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR expenditures are deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF. Please refer to Supplemental Schedule 9 for further detail. CR expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statements of Cash Flows.
CASUALTY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: Casualty capital expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs is reimbursed by insurance carriers based on deductibles associated with each loss.
CORE PROPERTIES: Conventional properties located in selected markets that Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term.
EFFECTIVE UNITS: Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. FCF is comprised of AFFO (defined above), with adjustments to add back interest expense, minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership, and preferred dividends. Because Aimco has unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting preferred stock redemption related redemption related costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/ distributions on dilutive preferred securities. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for FFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
NON-CORE PROPERTIES: Properties located in markets that are not considered selected markets or in less favored locations within selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for the intermediate term.
OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME), NET: Other expenses (income), net includes tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal.)
OTHER PROPERTIES: Conventional properties that have significant rent control restrictions, university housing properties that have been owned for more than one year and properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (2) other significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (done upon lease expirations), is underway or has been complete for less than one year, as of the earliest period presented. In both cases the properties have been removed from the Same Store portfolio.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe Conventional properties managed by Aimco, in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. Properties classified as held for sale are not included in Same Store. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions. Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. Please see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c for Same Store data reconciled to rental and other property revenues and property operating expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.
