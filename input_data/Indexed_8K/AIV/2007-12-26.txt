Under the agreement, Aimco contributed its wholly-owned properties The Palazzo at Park La Brea, The Palazzo East at Park La Brea and The Villas at Park La Brea to the Venture at a value of $726 million, or approximately $525,000 per unit.

Aimco will own approximately 53% of the Venture and will operate the properties in exchange for a property management fee and certain other fees over the term of the Venture.
According to David Robertson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aimco Capital, "Joint ventures allow us to rebalance efficiently our geographic allocation of capital while maintaining operational scale in our target markets. The recapitalization of the Palazzo properties is consistent with our overall asset allocation strategy and our focus on property operations. J.P. Morgan is recognized as a global leader in investment and wealth management, and we are pleased to have such a valued partner in this Venture."
Aimco intends to use the proceeds from this transaction for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock under its approved share repurchase program. "Using the proceeds of this joint venture to buy back shares at current market prices is accretive to Aimco's shareholders," said Tom Herzog, Chief Financial Officer. "The Palazzo Joint Venture is consistent with Aimco's view of the value embedded within our portfolio."
As announced separately today, in light of the closing of the Venture, Aimco's Board of Directors has also declared a special dividend.

DENVER, COLORADO, December 21, 2007
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE: AIV) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a special dividend payable to holders of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock of $2.51 per share, or approximately $232 million in the aggregate. The dividend will be payable not later than January 31, 2008, to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2007.
The special dividend will be payable in a combination of cash and additional shares of Class A Common Stock. The aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders in the special dividend, other than cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, will not exceed $55 million. Subject to this limitation on the aggregate amount of cash payable, stockholders will have the option to elect to receive payment of the special dividend in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, except that cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares.
A portion of the special dividend in the amount of $0.60 per share represents an accelerated payment of the regular first quarter 2008 quarterly cash dividend, and a portion represents an additional dividend payment as a result of the gain arising from the closing of the Palazzo joint venture and other property dispositions during 2007. Aimco expects the special dividend to be a taxable dividend to its stockholders, without regard to whether a particular stockholder receives the dividend in the form of cash or shares. It therefore allows Aimco to satisfy its REIT distribution requirement while preserving cash for other corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
This press release does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale. A prospectus and election form will be mailed to stockholders promptly after December 31, 2007, and will describe in more detail the special dividend and the process by which eligible stockholders may elect to receive the dividend in the form of cash and/or shares of Aimco's Class A Common Stock. The cash or stock election must be exercised prior to 5:00 p.m. (EST) on January 22, 2008.
