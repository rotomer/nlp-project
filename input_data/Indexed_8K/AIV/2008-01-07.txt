Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 31, 2007, AIMCO-GP, Inc. (the "General Partner"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("Aimco"), and the general partner of AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), entered into the First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement"). The First Amendment is summarized below. Partnership Common Units A holder of Partnership Common Units may redeem his or her units after a twelve month holding period in exchange for shares of Aimco common stock or cash, as determined by the Partnership in its sole discretion. The First Amendment provides that the number of shares of Aimco common stock issuable in exchange for Partnership Common Units upon redemption will not be adjusted if the Partnership concurrently pays a distribution with respect to each Partnership Common Unit consisting of (i) a number of Partnership Common Units (or fraction thereof) equal to the number of shares of Aimco common stock (or fraction thereof) paid as a dividend with respect to each share of Aimco common stock, or (ii) cash in an amount equal to the value, as determined in good faith by the General Partner, of the number of shares of Aimco common stock (or fraction thereof) paid as a dividend with respect to each share of Aimco common stock. High Performance Partnership Units The First Amendment effects the following changes with respect to the Partnerships High Performance Partnership Units:  A distribution of Aimco common stock will not be deemed an "Extraordinary Distribution."  A "Extraordinary Distribution" will not require any adjustment in the calculation of the "Value" of a "REIT Share" or in the calculation of "Total Return."  For purposes of calculating "Total Return," a stock dividend will not be treated as a dividend, but share prices a fter the ex-dividend date for a stock dividend will be adjusted to reflect its dilutive impact.  In lieu of the adjustment provisions previously in effect, in determining the "Value" of a share of Aimco common stock, the General Partner is authorized to adjust the market price for any trading day used in the calculation of the Value, to the extent necessary to reflect an event that occurs at any time after the commencement of the relevant valuation period that would unfairly distort the Value, including, without limitation, a stock dividend, split, subdivision, reverse stock split, or share combination. Class Five and Eight Partnership Preferred Units The Partnerships Class Five and Class Eight Partnership Preferred Units are convertible at the option of the holder into Partnership Common Units based on a formula in which a dollar amount is divided by the "value" of a share of Aimco common stock. In this case, "value" was not defined, but "Value" was already defined in the Partnership Agreement. In order to resolve the ambiguity, the First Amendment clarifies that "value" for this purpose has the same meaning as the defined term "Value" in the Partnership Agreement, which is the average closing price of Aimcos common stock over a specified ten day period. A copy of the First Amendment is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
