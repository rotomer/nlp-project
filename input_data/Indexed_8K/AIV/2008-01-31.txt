DENVER, COLORADO, January 30, 2008
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE: AIV) announced today the results of the stockholders' elections relating to Aimco's special dividend declared by its Board of Directors on December 21, 2007, to holders of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2007. The special dividend of $2.51 per share, or approximately $232 million in the aggregate, is payable January 30, 2008.
A portion of the special dividend in the amount of $0.60 per share represents an accelerated payment of the dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, and a portion represents an additional dividend payment in the amount of $1.91 as a result of taxable gains arising from property dispositions during 2007.
The terms of the special dividend, including the ability of shareholders to elect to receive the special distribution in the form of cash and/or shares of Aimco's Class A Common Stock, and a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be included in the special dividend, were described in detail in the prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 2, 2008.
Based on stockholder elections, Aimco expects the special dividend to consist of approximately 4.6 million shares of its Class A Common Stock, and approximately $55 million in cash. The number of shares included in the special distribution is calculated based on the $38.71 average closing price per share of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 23 and 24, 2008.  
Aimco's Class A Common Stock began trading "ex-dividend" for the special dividend on December 27, 2007.
