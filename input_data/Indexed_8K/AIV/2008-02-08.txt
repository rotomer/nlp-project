Management Comments
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco had a solid 2007. Property operating results improved on a Same Store basis by 4.5%. We invested more than $300 million in value-adding redevelopments. A highlight of the quarter for our asset management and transactions team was the formation of a joint venture with a fund managed by J.P. Morgan Asset Management to invest in certain Los Angeles properties. Given the current choppiness of the economy, we expect more moderate growth in 2008."
Chief Financial Officer Tom Herzog adds: "Fourth quarter FFO of $0.88 per share was in-line with guidance, as restated for the special dividend, and full year 2007 FFO of $3.25 per share was 10% higher than in 2006. During the fourth quarter 2007 and January 2008, Aimco repurchased, on an accretive basis, approximately 8.5 million shares of its Common Stock for approximately $302 million, or an average price of $35.19 per share. Looking ahead to 2008, we expect FFO of $0.68 to $0.72 per share in the first quarter and $3.22 to $3.38 per share for the year."
Property Operations
Conventional Real Estate Operations
Aimco is among the nation's largest owners and operators of market rate apartment communities. Conventional real estate operations consist of Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities. At the end of the fourth quarter 2007, this portfolio included 439 properties with 127,532 units in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 88%. During the fourth quarter 2007, conventional real estate operations generated net operating income of $179.9 million.
"Same Store" Results
In the fourth quarter 2007, the Same Store portfolio included 357 communities with 94,047 Effective Units (see the Glossary) based on Aimco's weighted average ownership of 88% (See Supplemental Schedules 6a through 7).
Comparing Same Store results in the fourth quarter 2007 with the fourth quarter 2006, total revenue increased $9.9 million, or 4.0%. The increase in revenue was primarily generated by higher average rent, up $24 per unit, or 2.8%, from $862 per unit to $886 per unit, higher occupancy, which was up 0.3% from 94.4% to 94.7%, and increased utility reimbursements, up $2.2 million. Same Store expenses of $105.5 million increased $5.6 million, or 5.7%, compared with the prior year period as a result of higher payroll, marketing, insurance, contract services and utilities. Same Store portfolio net operating income was $152.6 million for the fourth quarter 2007, up 2.9% from the fourth quarter 2006.
Same Store Operating Results
 
 
Comparing Same Store results on a sequential basis, total revenue increased $2.9 million in the fourth quarter 2007 compared with the third quarter of 2007, driven by a $5 per unit increase in average rental rates, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy of 10 basis points. Expenses decreased $1.6 million, or 1.5%, primarily due to lower turnover, contract services, repairs and maintenance costs and taxes. Net operating income increased $4.5 million, or 3.0%, on a sequential basis.
Comparing Same Store results on a full year basis, total revenue increased $41.4 million in 2007 compared with 2006, driven by a 3.7% increase in average rental rates per unit, a 20 basis point increase in occupancy and a 20.6% increase in utility reimbursements. Expenses increased $16.5 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to higher payroll, utilities, contract services, marketing, administrative expenses, taxes and insurance, partially offset by lower turnover and repairs and maintenance. Net operating income increased $24.9 million, or 4.5%, on a year-over-year basis.
Affordable Real Estate Operations
Aimco is among the nation's largest owners and operators of affordable apartment communities. At the end of the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco's owned affordable portfolio included 312 properties with 37,104 units in which Aimco had an average ownership of 51%. During the fourth quarter 2007, affordable property operations generated net operating income of $19.2 million. Average month-end occupancy for the affordable portfolio decreased 60 basis points from 96.9% for the fourth quarter 2006 to 96.3% for the fourth quarter 2007, while average rent per unit increased 5.1% from $719 to $756 per unit. Average month-end occupancy also decreased 60 basis points from 97.2% in 2006 to 96.6% for the full year 2007, while rents increased $28 per unit, or 3.9%, from $711 to $739 per unit.
Aimco Capital
Aimco Capital, a division led by a dedicated management team, oversees Aimco's portfolio management activities including acquisitions, dispositions and joint venture efforts, as well as asset management and partnership transactions.
Asset Management and Transactions
Asset management income is earned from the financial management of partnerships. Transaction income is earned from activities such as tax credit syndications, dispositions, refinancings and land sales. Proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of tax credits are recognized ratably as the tax benefits are delivered, and syndication fees are recognized upon completion of tax credit syndications. Consolidated asset management and transaction net operating income, net of tax, was $28.7 million in the fourth quarter 2007 compared to $13.3 million in the fourth quarter 2006. Consolidated asset management and transaction net operating income, net of tax, for the full year 2007 was $58.8 million, an increase of $18.1 million, or 44.3%, when compared to 2006. See Supplemental Schedule 11 for additional information on asset management and transaction income.
During the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco formed a joint venture with a fund managed by J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Aimco contributed to the venture The Palazzo at Park La Brea, The Palazzo East at Park La Brea and The Villas at Park La Brea at a value of $725.7 million, or approximately $525,000 per unit. Aimco received $202.2 million in cash from J.P. Morgan in exchange for an approximate 47% interest in the joint venture. Aimco receives property management and other fees for its continued operation of the properties.
Portfolio Management
ACQUISITIONS  During the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco had no significant acquisition activity.
 
 
DISPOSITIONS  Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria. In the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco sold eight non-core conventional properties and ten affordable properties with 1,675 and 689 units, respectively, for $101.5 million in gross proceeds (Aimco share $66.8 million). Aimco's share of net proceeds after repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $27.7 million.
Aimco's property dispositions resulted in gains on dispositions of real estate (including gains on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other and gains within discontinued operations) of $12.9 million for the fourth quarter 2007, compared with gains of $113.9 million for the fourth quarter 2006.
See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on acquisition and disposition activity.
Redevelopment
Aimco actively reinvests in and upgrades its portfolio through property redevelopments. At the end of the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco had 48 active conventional redevelopment projects and 11 active tax credit redevelopment projects in process. Aimco's share of total redevelopment expenditures was $121.5 million during the fourth quarter 2007. Conventional redevelopment project expenditures totaled $99.8 million and tax credit redevelopment project expenditures totaled $21.7 million for the quarter. Further information on redevelopment projects is provided in Supplemental Schedule 10.
Additional Financial Information
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT INCOME  Income from property management is generated when Aimco provides property management services to properties with unaffiliated partners. Income from consolidated properties is eliminated in Aimco's consolidated GAAP financial statements and the related economic benefit is reflected in minority interest.
INTEREST INCOME  Consolidated interest income was $11.1 million for the fourth quarter 2007 compared with $12.7 million for the fourth quarter 2006. Interest income is earned in part from money market and interest bearing accounts as well as on notes receivable from unconsolidated partnerships and non-affiliates.
DEBT ACTIVITY  During the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco closed 28 property loans generating gross proceeds of $398.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 6.24%. This included refinancing $121.6 million in existing mortgage loans, reducing the average interest rate from 6.74% to 6.08%. After repayment of existing property debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $248.9 million.
As of December 31, 2007, Aimco had $7.5 billion of consolidated debt outstanding, which consisted of: $5.7 billion of fixed rate mortgage debt, which is primarily non-recourse; $1.7 billion of floating rate property and corporate debt; and $75.1 million of other borrowings. In addition, Aimco had $100.0 million of floating rate preferred stock outstanding. Aimco's FFO exposure to changes in floating interest rates is mitigated by $698.4 million of tax-exempt bonds with rates tied to the Bond Market Association Index, which moves at approximately 0.68% for a 1.00% change in LIBOR. Aimco's exposure is further offset by floating rate assets, such as cash and notes receivable, and interest capitalized on entitlement and redevelopment properties. Based on Aimco's proportionate share of quarter-end balances (see Supplemental Schedule 3), Aimco estimates its sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in LIBOR to be approximately $0.02 per share per quarter.
See Supplemental Schedule 5 for more detail on debt characteristics and activity.
INTEREST EXPENSE  Consolidated interest expense was $110.5 million for the fourth quarter 2007 compared with $101.5 million for the fourth quarter 2006. The $9.0 million increase in interest expense is the result of higher balances on property debt, offset by lower weighted average interest rates and higher capitalized interest.
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  During the fourth quarter 2007, Aimco repurchased approximately 4.0 million shares of its Class A Common Stock at an average price of $37.28 per share for a total cost of $150.4 million, bringing full-year 2007 common stock repurchases to 7.5 million shares at an average price of $43.70 per share for a total cost of $325.8 million.
 
 
During the month of January 2008, Aimco repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of its Class A Common Stock at an average price of $33.33 per share for a total cost of $151.2 million. Since Aimco began repurchasing shares during the third quarter 2006, the company has repurchased approximately 14.3 million shares, or approximately 14.7% of shares outstanding on July 31, 2006, at an average price of $41.79 per share for a total cost of $597.3 million.
On January 29, 2008, the Aimco Board of Directors increased our existing share repurchase authorization by 25 million shares. We are currently authorized to repurchase approximately 28.7 million additional shares. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Aimco issued approximately 4.6 million shares of its Class A Common Stock on January 30, 2008, in connection with the payment of the special dividend declared on December 21, 2007. See additional details regarding dividends on Common Stock below, and further information regarding the impact of the special dividend on share count contained in the Special Supplement.
G&A  General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter 2007 of $23.9 million increased $0.5 million or 2.3% when compared with the fourth quarter 2006.
Outlook
For the first quarter 2008, FFO, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, is expected to be in a range from $0.68 to $0.72 per share. For the full year 2008, FFO, before impairment and preferred redemption charges, is expected to be in a range between $3.22 and $3.38 per share. Please refer to the Outlook Schedule, which follows the Consolidated Financial Statements in this release, for more detail on first quarter and full year 2008 guidance.
Dividends on Common Stock
As announced on December 21, 2007, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $2.51 per share of Class A Common Stock, paid on January 30, 2008, to stockholders of record on December 31, 2007. The special dividend was paid in a combination of approximately $55.0 million of cash and 4.6 million shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is taxable to the stockholders in 2007 without regard to whether a particular stockholder receives the dividend in the form of cash or shares. The special dividend allowed Aimco to satisfy its REIT distribution requirement while preserving cash for other corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
Cash dividends paid on Class A Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2007, totaled $2.40 per share, or 96% of AFFO (undiluted, excluding special dividend) and 70% of FFO (diluted, excluding special dividend), on a per share basis, and a 6.9% cash yield based on the $34.73 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2007.

Supplemental Schedule 9 Capital Expenditures Year Ended December 31, 2007 (in thousands, except per unit data) (unaudited)
All capital spending is classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI"), casualties, redevelopment or entitlement. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
The table below details Aimco's share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for Capital Replacements, Capital Improvements, casualties, redevelopment and entitlement for the year ended December 31, 2007. Per unit numbers are based on approximately 132,862 average units, including 115,046 conventional and 17,817 affordable units. Average units are weighted for the period and represent Effective Units excluding non-managed units. [1]

Special Supplement to Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Release (continued)
2007 Special Dividend
As announced on December 21, 2007, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $2.51 per share of Class A Common Stock, paid on January 30, 2008, to stockholders of record on December 31, 2007. The special dividend was paid in a combination of approximately $55.0 million of cash and 4.6 million additional shares of Class A Common Stock based on stockholder elections, subject to certain limitations. The dividend is taxable to the stockholders in 2007 without regard to whether a particular stockholder received the dividend in the form of cash or shares. The special dividend allowed Aimco to satisfy its REIT distribution requirement while preserving cash for other corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
A portion of the special dividend in the amount of $0.60 per share represents an accelerated payment of the dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, and a portion represents an additional dividend in the amount of $1.91 based on taxable gains arising from property dispositions during 2007. Summarized results of the special dividend payment are as follows:
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require that all reported per share data, for current and prior periods, be adjusted to reflect the issuance of the shares described above. The following table provides Aimco's reported fourth quarter and full year 2007 and 2006 results and the same results excluding the effect of the additional shares:
 
Glossary
GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES: Properties that have not reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less Capital Replacement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for preferred stock redemption related costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco Operating Partnership's share. Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for AFFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES: Affordable properties benefit from government programs designed to pay rental income on behalf of people with low or moderate incomes and includes properties that were owned for all periods presented.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI expenditures include all non-redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CI expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statements of Cash Flows.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): CR expenditures do not increase the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. They represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR expenditures are deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF. Please refer to Supplemental Schedule 9 for further detail. CR expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statements of Cash Flows.
CASUALTY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: Casualty capital expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs is reimbursed by insurance carriers based on deductibles associated with each loss.
CORE PROPERTIES: Conventional properties located in selected markets that Aimco intends to hold and improve over the long-term.
EFFECTIVE UNITS: Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. FCF is comprised of AFFO (defined above), with adjustments to add back interest expense, minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership, and preferred dividends. Because Aimco has unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting preferred stock redemption related redemption related costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/ distributions on dilutive preferred securities. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for FFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.
NON-CORE PROPERTIES: Properties located in markets that are not considered selected markets or in less favored locations within selected markets, which Aimco intends to hold for the intermediate term.
OTHER EXPENSES (INCOME), NET: Other expenses (income), net includes tax provision/benefit, franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal.)
 
Glossary (continued)
OTHER PROPERTIES: Conventional properties that have significant rent control restrictions, university housing properties that have been owned for more than one year and properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (2) other significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (done upon lease expirations), is underway or has been complete for less than one year, as of the earliest period presented. In both cases the properties have been removed from the Same Store portfolio.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe Conventional properties managed by Aimco, in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. Properties classified as held for sale are not included in Same Store. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions. Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. Please see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c for Same Store data reconciled to rental and other property revenues and property operating expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.
