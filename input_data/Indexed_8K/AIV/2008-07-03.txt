Item 8.01 Other Events.
On June 30, 2008, Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with a broker to facilitate the repurchase of shares of its Class A Common Stock. Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to purchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The shares to be repurchased under the Aimco's 10b5-1 plan would be part of the previously disclosed share repurchase authorization approved by Aimcos Board of Directors. The 10b5-1 share purchase period will commence in July 2008. Purchases will be implemented by a broker and will be based upon the guidelines and parameters of the 10b5-1 plan. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the share repurchase program, and Aimco may discontinue purchases at any time.
