Management Comments
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Property operations had a solid quarter with conventional same-store net operating income growth of 4.4%. Our redevelopment and capital investments are driving improved asset quality with more than $280 million invested in our properties year-to-date. Through our portfolio management activities, we continue to reallocate capital among our target markets and to improve portfolio quality. As we look forward to the balance of 2008, we are maintaining our focus on these core value-creating strategies."
Chief Financial Officer Tom Herzog adds:  "Second quarter FFO, before impairment losses, was $0.90 per share, or $0.09 above the mid-point of guidance. Positive results for the quarter included higher same-store operating results and investment management income, partially offset by several non-recurring items including the write-off of certain capitalized IT project costs and litigation costs. During the second quarter and through July, Aimco repurchased a total of 6.8 million shares of its Common Stock for $252.9 million, or an average price of $37.01 per share. We are establishing third quarter FFO guidance of $0.86 to $0.90 per share and increasing our full year FFO guidance from $3.22 to $3.38 per share to $3.33 to $3.43 per share."
Property Operations
Conventional Real Estate Operations
Aimco is among the nation's largest owners and operators of market rate apartment communities. Conventional real estate operations consist of Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities. At the end of the second quarter 2008, this portfolio included 397 properties with 114,687 units in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 89%. During the second quarter 2008, conventional real estate operations generated net operating income of $162.7 million.
"Same Store" Results
In the second quarter 2008, the Same Store portfolio included 302 communities with 81,293 Effective Units (see the Glossary) based on Aimco's weighted average ownership of 90% (See Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c).
Comparing Same Store results in the second quarter 2008 with the second quarter 2007, total revenue increased $4.6 million, or 2.1%. The increase in revenue was primarily generated by higher average rent, up $21 per unit, or 2.3%, from $897 per unit to $918 per unit, higher occupancy, which was up 10 basis points from 94.7% to 94.8%. Same Store expenses of $90.8 million decreased $1.2 million, or 1.3%, compared with the prior year, primarily due to decreases in personnel and related expenses. Same Store portfolio net operating income was $138.9 million for the second quarter 2008, up 4.4% from the second quarter 2007.
Same Store Operating Results
 
Comparing Same Store results on a sequential basis, total revenue increased $0.5 million, or 0.2%, in the second quarter 2008 compared with the first quarter 2008, driven by a $4 per unit increase in average rental rates and an increase in occupancy of 10 basis points, partially offset by lower utility reimbursements. Expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to lower personnel expenses, utilities, real estate taxes and insurance, partially offset by higher turnover costs, repairs and maintenance costs and contract services. Net operating income increased $3.2 million, or 2.4%, on a sequential basis.
Affordable Real Estate Operations
Aimco is among the nation's largest owners and operators of affordable apartment communities. At the end of the second quarter 2008, Aimco's owned affordable portfolio included 308 properties with 36,725 units in which Aimco had an average ownership of 51%. During the second quarter 2008, affordable property operations generated net operating income of $22.2 million. Average month-end occupancy for the affordable portfolio increased 20 basis points from 97.8% for the second quarter 2007 to 98.0% for the second quarter 2008, while average rent per unit increased 3.4% from $739 to $764 per unit.
Investment Management
Investment management includes portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities. Within our owned portfolio, we refer to these activities as Portfolio Management and their benefit is seen in property operating results and in investment gains. For affiliated partnerships, we refer to these activities as Asset Management for which we are separately compensated through fees paid by third party investors.
Investment management income includes the fees earned for providing asset management services to third party investors, syndication fees and deferred income related to tax credit activities, and portfolio management income earned through investment gains on our owned assets. Consolidated investment management income, net of tax, was $29.2 million in the second quarter 2008 compared to $8.8 million in the second quarter 2007. See Supplemental Schedule 11 for additional information on investment management income.
Portfolio Management
Portfolio management includes the ongoing allocation of investment capital to meet our geographic and product type goals. Our geographic allocation strategy focuses on the largest 20 U.S. markets as measured by total market capitalization. We believe these markets to be deep, relatively liquid and possessing desirable long-term growth characteristics. They are primarily coastal markets, and also include a number of Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois. We may also invest in other markets on an opportunistic basis. As we implement this strategy, we expect to reduce our investment in markets outside the largest 20 markets and to increase our investment in the largest 20 markets both by making acquisitions and through redevelopment spending.
See Supplemental Schedules 6 and 7 for additional details regarding Aimco's portfolio allocation.
ACQUISITIONS  During the second quarter 2008, Aimco acquired Monterey Grove Apartments with 224 units, located in San Jose, California, for $56.0 million, or $250,000 per unit.
DISPOSITIONS  Aimco regularly reviews its portfolio to identify properties that do not meet its long-term investment criteria. In the second quarter 2008, Aimco sold 40 conventional properties and one affordable property with 12,662 and 240 units, respectively, for $921.5 million in gross proceeds (Aimco share $787.6 million). Aimco's share of net proceeds after repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $367.8 million.
Aimco's property dispositions resulted in gains on dispositions of real estate (including gains on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other and gains within discontinued operations) of $314.2 million for the second quarter 2008, compared with gains of $24.9 million for the second quarter 2007.
See Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional information on acquisition and disposition activity.
 
Redevelopment
Aimco actively reinvests in and upgrades its portfolio through property redevelopments. At the end of the second quarter 2008, Aimco had 44 active conventional redevelopment projects and 18 active tax credit redevelopment projects in process. Aimco's share of total redevelopment expenditures was $81.3 million during the second quarter 2008. Conventional redevelopment project expenditures totaled $61.6 million and tax credit redevelopment project expenditures totaled $19.7 million for the quarter. Further information on redevelopment projects is provided in Supplemental Schedule 10.
Additional Financial Information
INTEREST INCOME  Consolidated interest income was $0.7 million for the second quarter 2008 compared with $10.1 million for the second quarter 2007. Interest income is earned in part from money market and interest bearing accounts as well as on notes receivable from unconsolidated partnerships and non-affiliates. The decrease in interest income of $9.4 million is the result of lower interest rates, the repayment of certain high yielding notes receivable from unconsolidated partnerships in the second quarter 2007 and an adjustment to accretion of discounted notes receivable.
DEBT ACTIVITY  During the six months ended June 30, 2008, Aimco closed loans on 47 properties generating gross proceeds of $443.3 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.41%. This included refinancing $151.2 million in existing mortgage loans. After repayment of existing property debt, transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, Aimco's share of net proceeds was $255.5 million.
As of June 30, 2008, Aimco had $7.4 billion of consolidated debt outstanding, which consisted of: $5.6 billion of fixed rate mortgage debt; $1.7 billion of floating rate property and corporate debt; and $87.8 million of other borrowings. In addition, Aimco had $100.0 million of floating rate preferred stock outstanding. The fixed and floating rate property debt is primarily non-recourse. Aimco's FFO exposure to changes in floating interest rates is mitigated by $684.3 million of tax-exempt bonds with rates tied to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index (SIFMA) (previously named the Bond Market Association Index), which moves at approximately 0.68% for a 1.00% change in LIBOR. Aimco's exposure is further offset by floating rate assets, such as cash and notes receivable, and interest capitalized on entitlement and redevelopment properties. Based on Aimco's proportionate share of quarter-end balances (see Supplemental Schedule 3), Aimco estimates its sensitivity to a 100 basis point change in LIBOR to be approximately $0.02 per share per quarter.
See Supplemental Schedule 5 for more detail on debt characteristics and activity.
INTEREST EXPENSE  Consolidated interest expense was $102.4 million for the second quarter 2008 compared with $95.6 million for the second quarter 2007. The $6.8 million increase in interest expense is the result of higher balances on property debt, partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates.
STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  During the second quarter 2008, Aimco repurchased approximately 3.9 million shares of its Class A Common Stock at an average price of $38.91 per share for a total cost of $152.9 million.
During the month of July 2008, Aimco repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of its Class A Common Stock at an average price of $34.45 per share for a total cost of $100.0 million. Since Aimco began repurchasing shares during the third quarter 2006, the company has repurchased approximately 21.7 million shares, or approximately 22% of shares outstanding on June 30, 2006, at an average price of $40.15 per share for a total cost of $869.6 million.
Although for financial statement purposes GAAP requires that historical share repurchases be restated to reflect shares issued in connection with the special dividend paid on January 30, 2008, the number of shares repurchased as described above has not been adjusted.
We are currently authorized to repurchase approximately 21.3 million additional shares. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
G&A  General and administrative expenses for the second quarter 2008 of $27.1 million increased $3.0 million when compared with the second quarter 2007 primarily due to personnel and related costs.
 
Outlook
For the third quarter 2008, FFO, before impairment losses and preferred redemption charges, is expected to be in a range from $0.86 to $0.90 per share and we are increasing our full year FFO guidance from a range of $3.22 to $3.38 per share to a range of $3.33 to $3.43 per share. Please refer to the Outlook Schedule, which follows the Consolidated Financial Statements in this release, for more detail on third quarter and full year 2008 guidance.
Dividends on Common Stock
As announced on July 18, 2008, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $3.00 per share of Class A Common Stock, to be paid on August 29, 2008, to stockholders of record on July 28, 2008. A portion of the special dividend in the amount of $0.60 per share represents payment of the regular dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and a portion represents an additional dividend payment in the amount of $2.40 per share associated with actual and projected taxable gains arising from property dispositions in 2008.
The special dividend will be payable in a combination of cash and additional shares of Class A Common Stock. The aggregate amount of cash payable to stockholders in the special dividend, other than cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, is not expected to exceed $51.3 million. Subject to this limitation on the aggregate amount of cash payable, stockholders will have the option to make an election to receive payment of the special dividend in cash or in shares, except that cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares. Stockholders who do not make an election, or elect to receive the special dividend in all cash, will receive payment in the form of at least $0.60 per share in cash.
A prospectus and election form will be mailed to stockholders on or about August 4, 2008, and will describe in more detail the terms of the special dividend, including the ability of stockholders to elect to receive the special dividend in the form of cash or shares of Aimco's Class A Common Stock, and a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be included in the special dividend. The election must be made prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on August 20, 2008.
Aimco expects the special dividend to be a taxable dividend to its stockholders, without regard to whether a particular stockholder receives the dividend in the form of cash or shares. It therefore allows Aimco to satisfy its REIT distribution requirement while preserving cash for other corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
Share and per share amounts disclosed in the accompanying earnings release and supplemental schedules have not been retroactively adjusted for the effect of shares to be issued pursuant to this special dividend, as the number of shares is not presently determinable. Such retroactive adjustments will be reflected in earnings releases and financial information prepared subsequent to the payment date.
Cash dividends declared on Class A Common Stock attributable to the six months ended June 30, 2008, totaled $1.20 per share, or 100% of AFFO (undiluted) and 74% of FFO (diluted), on a per share basis, and a 7.0% cash yield based on the $34.06 closing price of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on June 30, 2008. Cash dividends attributable to the six months ended June 30, 2008, include that portion of the July 2008 special dividend which represents payment of the regular dividend for the second quarter 2008.

Capital Expenditures Six Months Ended June 30, 2008 (in thousands, except per unit data) (unaudited)
All capital spending is classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI"), casualties, redevelopment or entitlement. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
The table below details Aimco's share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for Capital Replacements, Capital Improvements, casualties, redevelopment and entitlement for the six months ended June 30, 2008. Per unit numbers are based on approximately 130,088 average units, including 113,155 conventional and 16,933 affordable units. Average units are weighted for the period and represent Effective Units excluding non-managed units. [1]

Glossary
GLOSSARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES: Financial and operating measures found in the Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. These measures are defined below and, where appropriate, reconciled on the accompanying Supplemental Schedules to the most comparable GAAP measures.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES: Properties that have not reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO): AFFO is FFO (diluted) less Capital Replacement expenditures, plus non-cash charges for preferred stock redemption related costs and impairment losses, all of which are adjusted for the Aimco Operating Partnership's share. Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for AFFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES: Affordable properties benefit from government programs designed to pay rental income on behalf of people with low or moderate incomes and includes properties that were owned for all periods presented.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI expenditures include all non-redevelopment capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CI expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statements of Cash Flows.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): CR expenditures do not increase the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. They represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR expenditures are deducted in the calculation of AFFO and FCF. Please refer to Supplemental Schedule 9 for further detail. CR expenditures are a component of capital expenditures in the GAAP Statements of Cash Flows.
CASUALTY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: Casualty capital expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs is reimbursed by insurance carriers based on deductibles associated with each loss.
EFFECTIVE UNITS: Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share.
FREE CASH FLOW (FCF): FCF measures profitability of operations and is prior to the cost of capital. FCF is comprised of AFFO (defined above), with adjustments to add back interest expense, minority interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership, and preferred dividends. Because Aimco has unconsolidated real estate interests, it is useful for management and investors to understand, in addition to consolidated cash flows, cash flows related to Aimco's unconsolidated real estate holdings.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO): FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper. Aimco calculates FFO (diluted) by subtracting preferred stock redemption related redemption related costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/ distributions on dilutive preferred securities. FFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Please see Supplemental Schedule 1 for FFO data reconciled to net income as determined in accordance with GAAP.

OTHER PROPERTIES: Conventional properties that have significant rent control restrictions, university housing properties that have been owned for more than one year and properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES: Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or (2) other significant renovation, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements (done upon lease expirations), is underway or has been complete for less than one year, as of the earliest period presented. In both cases the properties have been removed from the Same Store portfolio.
SAME STORE: Same Store is used commonly to describe Conventional properties managed by Aimco, in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10% and that have reached a stabilized level of occupancy during both the current and comparable prior year period. Properties classified as held for sale are not included in Same Store. These results measure operating performance without variations caused by investment transactions. Aimco provides data for consolidated Same Store properties as well as its proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated Same Store properties. To ensure comparability, the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership. Please see Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c for Same Store data reconciled to rental and other property revenues and property operating expense as determined in accordance with GAAP.
