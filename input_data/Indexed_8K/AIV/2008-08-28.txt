2008 Compensation Matters On August 28, 2008, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco"), which Committee also constitutes all of, and only, the independent members of the Aimco Board, in conjunction with Terry Considine, Aimcos Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, addressed various compensation matters for Aimcos named executive officers. The Committee, in conjunction with Mr. Considine, set total target compensation (base compensation plus bonus compensation) for 2008 for Timothy J. Beaudin, which total target compensation is based on achievement of the objectives of Aimcos 2008 approved operating plan and achievement of specific individual objectives. Total target compensation is comprised of a base salary rate of $500,000 per annum (from $350,000), which base salary will be made effective as of January 1, 2008, and target bonus compen sation in a range of $1.8 million to $2.5 million. The Committee also increased total target compensation for Terry Considine to a range of $4.5 million to $6 million (which includes an annual base salary rate of $600,000). Aimco also: increased David Robertsons annual base salary rate to $500,000 (from $400,000) and set his target bonus compensation at a range of $1.8 million to $2.5 million; increased Thomas M. Herzogs annual base salary to $450,000 (from $350,000) and set his target bonus compensation at a range of $1.05 million to $1.55 million; and set Lance J. Grabers target bonus compensation at a range of $650,000 to $1.65 million. Base salary changes will be made effective as of July 1, 2008. Target bonus compensation amounts are based in part on Aimcos achievement of the objectives in its operating plan and individual objectives. If such objectives are not achieved or if individual performance so warrants, the amount paid for bonus compensation m ay be less than this target, and if such objectives are exceeded or if individual performance so warrants, the amount paid for bonus compensation may exceed this target. Bonus compensation may be paid in the form of cash, options or restricted stock.
