Exhibit 99.1
DENVER, COLORADO, August 28, 2008
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE: AIV) announced today the results of the stockholders' elections relating to Aimco's second quarter 2008 special dividend declared by its Board of Directors on July 18, 2008. The special dividend of $3.00 per share of Class A Common Stock is payable on August 29, 2008, to stockholders of record on July 28, 2008. Aimco's Class A Common Stock began trading "ex-dividend" for the special dividend on July 24, 2008.
A portion of the special dividend in the amount of $0.60 per share represents payment of the regular dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and a portion represents an additional dividend payment in the amount of $2.40 per share associated with taxable gains arising from property dispositions in 2008.
Aimco expects the special dividend to be a taxable dividend to its stockholders, without regard to whether a particular stockholder receives the dividend in the form of cash or shares. It therefore allows Aimco to satisfy its REIT distribution requirement while preserving cash for other corporate purposes, including share repurchases.
The terms of the special dividend, including the ability of shareholders to elect to receive the special distribution in the form of cash or shares of Aimco's Class A Common Stock, and a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be included in the special dividend, were described in detail in the prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 28, 2008. The cash or stock elections were required to be exercised prior to 5:00 p.m. (EDT) on August 20, 2008.
Based on stockholder elections, the special dividend will consist of approximately $51.4 million in cash and approximately 5.7 million shares of its Class A Common Stock. The number of shares included in the special distribution is calculated based on the $35.84 average closing price per share of Aimco's Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on August 21 and 22, 2008. Summarized results of the special dividend elections are as follows:
 
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or nominee, and you have questions regarding the special dividend, please contact such bank, broker or nominee. If you are a registered stockholder and you have questions regarding the special dividend, you may call Aimco's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at (781) 575-2879 or (800) 733-5001.

Exhibit 99.2
Apartment Investment and Management Company
Financial and Share Information Adjusted for Special Dividends - September 2008
In December 2007, Aimco declared a special dividend, which was paid in a combination of cash and stock. In July 2008, Aimco declared a second special dividend, also payable in a combination of cash and stock. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) require that all reported per share data, for current and prior periods, be adjusted to reflect the issuance of the shares in connection with these special dividends as if such shares had been issued at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The purpose of this document is to provide additional information to users of Aimco's financial information to facilitate an understanding of the effect of shares issued in connection with the special dividends on previously reported Earnings per share, Funds from Operations per share and Adjusted Funds from Operations per share. The analyses that follow this summary represent the detailed computations of the adjustments to these metrics resulting from the retroactive adjustments to reported weighted average shares and share equivalents as required by GAAP on a quarterly and annual basis for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and the first half of 2008.
Aimco is not providing updated guidance; however, users of Aimco's financial information should be aware that guidance provided during Aimco's second quarter earnings conference call did not contemplate the number of shares to be issued in connection with the special dividend declared in July 2008, as the number of shares to be issued was not determinable at that time.
