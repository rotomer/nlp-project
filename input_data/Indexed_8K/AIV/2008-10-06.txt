On October 1, 2008, Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") issued a press release concerning its preliminary assessment of the damage caused by Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. On September 30, 2008, Aimco entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan with a broker to facilitate the repurchase of shares of its Class A Common Stock. Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to purchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. The shares to be repurchased under the Aimco's 10b5-1 plan would be part of the previously disclosed share repurchase authorization approved by Aimcos Board of Directors. The 10b5-1 share purchase period will commence in October 2008. Purchases will be implemented by a broker and will be based upon the guidelines and parameters of the 10b5-1 plan. There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the share repurchase program, and Aimco may discontinue purchases at any time.

DENVER, COLORADO, October 1, 2008
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE:AIV) announced today that it has completed a preliminary assessment of damage caused by Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike.
Tropical Storm Fay, which made its first U.S. landfall on the Florida Keys on August 18, damaged 53 Aimco apartment properties with 50 properties affected in Florida and three in other states. Hurricane Ike made U.S. landfall at Galveston, Texas on September 13 and subsequently damaged 62 Aimco properties, including 25 in Houston and surrounding areas, six in Galveston and other parts of the Gulf Coast, four in Dallas and surrounding areas, and 27 in other states as the storm tracked through the Midwest.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Despite the severity of these storms, we are thankful that we had no reports of injury to any of our residents or team members. Clean up efforts are well underway and we continue to focus on providing quality apartment homes and a superior customer experience to all of Aimco's residents in areas affected by the storms and across the country."
Property damage was caused by strong winds and/or water intrusion from heavy rains associated with the storms and included damage to roofs, exterior siding, and landscaping. Repairs at a number of the affected properties are expected to cost less than the deductible for insurance coverage. Aimco's properties did not sustain any structural damage as a result of these storms.
Based on preliminary estimates, Aimco's share of the casualty expenses (net of any third party insurance coverage) from the two storms is expected to be from $3.0 million to $6.0 million, or approximately $0.03 to $0.06 per share, in Funds From Operations ("FFO") for the third quarter 2008, which was not previously considered in guidance.
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding third quarter 2008 financial results. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from projections.

These forward-looking statements reflect management's judgment as of this date, and Aimco assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect future events or circumstances.
