DENVER, COLORADO  October 10, 2008
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE: AIV) announced today that management expects to recommend that its Board of Directors declare a special dividend to holders of its Class A Common Stock of $1.80 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Management expects to recommend that the special dividend be payable in a combination of cash and additional shares of Class A Common Stock ("Common Stock").
If declared, a portion of the special dividend, in the amount of $0.60 per share, would represent payment of the regular dividend for the third quarter 2008, and a portion would represent an additional dividend payment in the amount of $1.20 per share associated with taxable gains arising from property dispositions in 2008. Further details regarding the terms and conditions of the special dividend will be announced at such time as the special dividend is declared by Aimco's Board of Directors.
Aimco also announced today the following summary data regarding its preliminary unaudited results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. This report will be augmented when final third quarter results are released and management holds its quarterly earnings conference call on October 31, 2008. At the end of the third quarter 2008, Aimco had:
Chief Financial Officer Tom Herzog comments: "The tumultuous state of the current financial markets highlights the importance of liquidity, and Aimco's balance sheet remains sound. Our property debt is non-recourse with laddered maturities to minimize refunding risk. The majority of Aimco's term debt matures in 2011 and our revolving credit facility is substantially free-and-clear."
During the third quarter 2008, Aimco sold a total of 45 properties for approximately $814 million in gross proceeds (approximately $347 million of net proceeds to Aimco) at a free cash flow cap rate of approximately 6%, inclusive of $500 per unit of capital replacement costs. Year-to-date, Aimco has sold 90 properties for approximately $1.77 billion in gross proceeds (approximately $723 million of net proceeds to Aimco).
Additional highlights from the third quarter 2008 include:
Based on preliminary results, third quarter 2008 Funds from Operations ("FFO"), before impairment losses and previously disclosed casualty expenses associated with Hurricane Ike and Tropical Storm Fay, is expected to meet or exceed guidance of $0.81 to $0.85 per share, which is unchanged from that previously provided (after a $0.05 per share adjustment for shares issued in connection with the second quarter 2008 special dividend). Similarly, year-to-date FFO, before impairment losses and casualty expenses associated with Hurricane Ike and Tropical Storm Fay, is also expected to meet or exceed guidance. As previously disclosed, based on preliminary estimates, Aimco's share of the casualty expenses (net of third party insurance coverage) from Hurricane Ike and Tropical Storm Fay is expected to be approximately $0.03 to $0.06 per share.
Aimco expects to provide guidance for 2009 in the ordinary course in its fourth quarter 2008 earnings report and on management's earnings conference call in February 2009. At this point, management expects continued softening of the economy in 2009. As previously discussed, the pace of property sales may be affected by broader financial conditions and Aimco will continue to carefully review the allocation of any sales proceeds between debt reduction, share repurchases and redevelopment investment, each of which would have differing impacts on 2009 FFO. Additionally, the company expects a reduction in transaction income, primarily as a result of lower promote income than earned in 2008.
The recent substantial reduction in the price of Aimco's Common Stock has caused certain involuntary sales of Common Stock pledged to secure margin debt by two family partnerships in which Terry Considine, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, holds less than a 0.5% interest overall. The partnerships pledged approximately 2.5 million shares of Common Stock to secure approximately $50 million in borrowings used to buy Common Stock. Approximately 600,000 shares have been involuntarily sold to date. In addition, David Robertson, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, may be subject to involuntary sales in connection with margin debt secured by 173,000 shares of Common Stock.
