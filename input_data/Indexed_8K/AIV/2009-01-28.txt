DENVER, COLORADO  January 28, 2009
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") (NYSE: AIV) announced today that it will incur non-cash charges during the fourth quarter 2008 associated with the impairment of three real estate development assets: two California properties and an investment in Casden Properties, LLC, which holds land and other development assets in Southern California.
In connection with the preparation of its annual financial statements, Aimco assessed the recoverability of its investment in its Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the decline in land values in Southern California and the expected timing of the company's redevelopment efforts, Aimco determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of recovery and, accordingly, during the fourth quarter will recognize an impairment loss of $85.4 million, or $55.6 million, net of tax.
Similarly, Aimco assessed the recoverability of its investment in Treetops, a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying value for the property exceeds its estimated fair value. Accordingly, Aimco will recognize an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the fourth quarter 2008.
As part of the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc., Aimco acquired a 20% passive interest in Casden Properties, LLC, an entity organized to re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. In connection with preparation of its annual financial statements and as a result of the aforementioned decline in Southern California land values, Aimco has determined that its investment is not recoverable, and accordingly will recognize an impairment loss of $16.3 million, or $10.0 million, net of tax, during the fourth quarter 2008.
In addition to the impairment charges described above, on January 7, 2009, Aimco announced a fourth quarter pre-tax restructuring charge expected to range from $21.0 to $28.0 million, or $19.0 to $26.0 million, net of tax. In the aggregate, the restructuring and impairment charges will reduce fourth quarter 2008 Funds from Operations by $90.3 to $97.3 million, net of tax, or $0.72 to $0.77 per share, as adjusted for shares to be issued in connection with the special dividend to be paid on January 29, 2009.
