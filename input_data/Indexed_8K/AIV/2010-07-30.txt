EXHIBIT 99.1
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces Second Quarter 2010 Results
Denver, Colorado  July 30, 2010  Apartment Investment and Management Company (NYSE: AIV) announced today its second quarter 2010 results.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco's business plan is simple: to own and operate B/B+ quality apartments in the 20 largest U.S. markets to generate solid returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, we had high occupancy and good demand leading to improved pricing. While rental rates on new leases in the aggregate were down from the prior year, new lease rates turned positive in several of our markets for the first time in five quarters. Rental rates on renewals were up in every market but one. We sold eleven properties and on July 26, repaid the $25 million balance on our Term Debt, leaving no recourse debt on our balance sheet. Our focus remains on providing excellent service to our customers, maintaining our properties, controlling our costs, and strengthening our balance sheet."
th
Chief Financial Officer Ernie Freedman adds: "Second quarter Pro forma FFO of $0.41 per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.10 per share, with a $0.06 contribution from better than expected operating results and $0.03 of one-time items that were not contemplated in our guidance. We are increasing our guidance for full year 2010 Pro forma FFO from a range of $1.25 to $1.35 per share to a range of $1.37 to $1.45 per share and we are establishing third quarter Pro forma FFO guidance of $0.32 to $0.36 per share."
Financial Results
Diluted Per Share Results
Net income (loss)  Net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders for the quarter was $18.0 million, compared to net loss of $29.9 million for second quarter 2009. Second quarter 2010 net loss was less than second quarter 2009 primarily due to other income associated with the settlement of certain litigation matters during second quarter 2010. The increase in other income was partially offset by dilution from 2009 asset sales and lower transaction revenues.
Funds from Operations  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the glossary in Aimco's Supplemental Information (the Glossary). FFO calculated in accordance with the definition prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) was $46.9 million, or $0.40 per share, compared with $38.7 million, or $0.34 per share, in second quarter 2009. Pro forma FFO, which represents FFO as prescribed by NAREIT but excludes operating real estate impairment losses (recoveries) and preferred stock redemption related gains, was $47.8 million, or $0.41 per share, compared with $52.3 million, or $0.45 per share, in second quarter 2009. Second quarter 2010 Pro forma FFO of $0.41 per share was $0.10 per share above the midpoint of Aimco's guidance range primarily as a result of better than expected operating results of $0.06 per share and one-time items of $0.03 per share, which were not anticipated in guidance.
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
Property Operations
Property operating results discussed below represent Aimco's Proportionate Share of reported amounts, which reflects property operating results adjusted for Aimco's ownership in each property. This non-GAAP measure is defined in the Glossary.
Diversified Operating Portfolio  Aimco's property operations consist primarily of Conventional with some Affordable real estate operations. Conventional real estate operations relate to Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities and include Same Store Properties, Redevelopment Properties, Acquisition Properties, and Other Properties. See Supplemental Schedules 7a and 7b for detailed information on Aimco's Conventional real estate portfolio, including selected operating results.
Affordable real estate operations relate to Aimco's portfolio of properties with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Affordable properties tend to have more stable rents and higher occupancy than Conventional properties due to government rent payments and thus are much less affected by market fluctuations.
Portfolio Operating Measures
*
Conventional Same Store Results  In second quarter 2010, the Conventional Same Store portfolio included 168 communities with 56,272 units, in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 92%.
Conventional Same Store Operating Measures
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
Comparing Conventional Same Store results in second quarter 2010 with second quarter 2009, total revenue decreased $0.8 million, or 0.5%. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of lower average rent, down 4.4% or $46 per unit, from $1,056 per unit to $1,010 per unit, largely offset by higher average daily occupancy of 95.6% for second quarter 2010 compared to 92.8% for second quarter 2009. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the quarter were 2.3% lower than the expiring lease rates, while renewal rates were 1.9% higher than the expiring lease rates. New and renewal lease rates improved throughout the quarter, with June 2010 new lease rates 1.4% lower than the expiring lease rates and renewal rates 2.4% higher than the expiring lease rates. June 2010 new and renewal lease rates also compared favorably to beginning of year new lease rates that were 8.9% lower than the expiring lease rates and renewal rates that were 0.7% lower than the expiring lease rates. Conventional Same Store expenses increased $0.3 million or 0.5%, with higher marketing and turnover costs substantially offset by lower property taxes and insurance. Refer to Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6c for additional details on Conventional Same Store operating results.
Affordable Same Store Results  In second quarter 2010, the Affordable Same Store portfolio included 166 communities with 20,122 units, in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 62%. For the second quarter 2010, average month-end occupancy for the affordable portfolio was 97.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points from second quarter 2009, while average rent per unit increased 1.6% from $768 to $780 per unit.
Portfolio
Aimco's portfolio strategy focuses on B/B+ quality Conventional apartment communities located in the 20 largest U.S. markets, with a target capital allocation of 10% to Affordable apartment communities.
Aimco measures Conventional property asset quality based on average rents compared to local market average rents as reported by REIS, a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance information and analysis. Aimco defines A-quality assets as those with rents greater than 125% of local market average, B-quality assets as those with rents 90% to 125% of local market average and C-quality assets as those with rents less than 90% of local market average. For the first quarter 2010, the most current period for which REIS information is available, Aimco's Conventional property rents averaged 101% of local market average rents.
For the second quarter 2010, average rents for the Conventional portfolio were $1,042 per unit, a 0.8% increase compared to second quarter 2009, primarily as a result of the sale of Conventional properties during 2009 with rents averaging 33% less than the retained portfolio.
Aimco's geographic allocation strategy focuses on the 20 largest U.S. markets as measured by total apartment value. Aimco believes these markets to be deep, relatively liquid and possessing desirable long-term growth characteristics. These target markets are primarily coastal markets, and also include a number of Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois. As Aimco executes this strategy, the Company expects to reduce its investment in markets outside the 20 largest markets and to increase its investment in the 20 largest markets through redevelopment and acquisitions. During second quarter 2010, net operating income generated by Conventional properties located in the 20 largest markets accounted for 82.6% of total Conventional property net operating income, an increase of 0.8% compared to second quarter 2009.
In second quarter 2010, Aimco sold seven Conventional properties and four Affordable properties with 1,327 and 597 units, respectively for $102.2 million in gross proceeds. Aimco's share of net proceeds after distributions to limited partners, repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $25.0 million. Proceeds were used primarily to repay recourse term debt.
See Supplemental Schedules 7a and 7b for additional details regarding Aimco's portfolio quality and capital allocation, and Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional details on disposition activity.
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
See Supplemental Schedules 4a and 4b for additional details about Aimco's non-recourse property debt and Supplemental Schedule 5 for information related to Aimco's preferred securities.
Aimco's recourse debt at June 30, 2010, was limited to its revolving credit facility and corporate term debt. At that time, the balance on Aimco's revolving credit facility was zero and available capacity was $137.1 million, net of $42.9 million of letters of credit issued against the facility. Aimco's revolving credit facility is used for working capital purposes and to secure letters of credit. At the end of second quarter 2010, the balance on Aimco's corporate term debt was $25.0 million, which balance was repaid in full in July 2010.
In connection with its revolving credit facility, Aimco is subject to Debt Service and Fixed Charge Coverage covenants, as defined in the Glossary. For second quarter 2010, Aimco's Debt Service and Fixed Charge Coverage ratios were 1.57:1 and 1.34:1, compared to covenants in place during the quarter of 1.40:1 and 1.20:1, respectively, and first quarter 2010 ratios of 1.59:1 and 1.35:1. Aimco expects to remain in compliance with these covenants.

Forward-looking Statements
This earnings release and Supplemental Information contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding projected results and specifically forecasts of third quarter and full year 2010 results. These forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date and include certain risks and uncertainties.
Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Aimco's ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rates and property operating results. Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond the control of Aimco, including, without limitation: financing risks, including the availability and cost of capital markets financing and the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which Aimco operates; the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; insurance risk, including the cost of insurance; natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; energy costs; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by Aimco.
In addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.
Readers should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and notes thereto, as well as the risk factors described in Aimco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Supplemental Schedule 9
Capital Additions
(in thousands, except per unit data) (unaudited)
All capital additions are classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI"), redevelopment or casualties. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capital additions are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
Amounts below represent actual additions related to residential properties that are owned and managed by Aimco at the end of the period. These amounts include consolidated and unconsolidated properties and are not adjusted for Aimco's ownership interest in such properties. Amounts do not include capital additions related to:
See the Glossary for a reconciliation of these amounts to GAAP capital additions.
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
Glossary and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating Measures
This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Aimco's definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity.
Properties that have been acquired during the twelve months prior to the current quarter-end that have not reached a stabilized level of occupancy during the current period and each period for which comparable results are presented.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES:
AFFO is Pro forma FFO, as defined below, less Capital Replacement additions, also defined below, adjusted for the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of such Capital Replacements. Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. A reconciliation of Pro forma FFO, as presented in Supplemental Schedules 1(a) and 1(b), to AFFO is presented below.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO):
Affordable Properties benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax-credit equity, or rental assistance payments to the property owners. Under these programs, rent adjustments are made in accordance with property-specific contracts between Aimco and HUD, with rent increases generally based on an adjustment factor set by HUD annually. Aimco targets an investment in Affordable Properties of 10% or less of Net Asset Value, which serves to offset the volatility of our Conventional portfolio; provide revenue growth that over time is similar to that of Conventional Properties; expand our investment opportunities; and provide helpful positioning with government bodies, benefiting Aimco's business overall.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco's UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 93% of the common partnership units of the Aimco Operating Partnership.
AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP:
Non-GAAP measures representing Aimco's share of financial information discussed in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information. Aimco's proportionate share of financial information includes Aimco's share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Proportionate reporting benefits the users of Aimco's financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable only to Aimco stockholders. Aimco also refers to this measure as "Aimco's Share" of financial information. See Supplemental Schedules 1, 3 and 4 for reconciliation of Aimco's proportionate share of financial results to Aimco's consolidated financial statements.
AIMCO PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATION
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI): CI additions include all non-redevelopment capital additions that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR): Unlike CI additions, CR additions do not increase the useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. They represent the share of additions that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR additions are deducted in the calculation of AFFO.
CASUALTY CAPITAL ADDITIONS: Capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs is reimbursed by insurance carriers net of deductibles associated with each loss.
Supplemental Schedule 9 contains capital additions information related to (1) residential properties that Aimco owns and manage at the end of the period, (2) properties that are consolidated in Aimco's GAAP financial statements, and (3) properties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Aimco's GAAP financial statements. Amounts do not include capital additions related to:
Aimco believes the capital addition detail provided in Supplemental Schedule 9 provides an enhanced understanding of capital additions related to our primary business of owning and operating apartment communities. A reconciliation of capital additions presented on Supplemental Schedule 9 to Aimco's consolidated GAAP information is presented below.
Conventional Properties represent Aimco's portfolio of market-rate apartment communities. Aimco focuses on owning and operating apartment communities with rents that are 100% to 125% of local market average rents and concentrates its investment in the 20 largest apartment markets in the United States, as measured by apartment value. Aimco targets an investment in Conventional Properties of 90% or more of Net Asset Value.
CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Aimco's adjusted total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which is reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves) to (b) the actual debt service, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO:
Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share. Effective Units may be used to analyze Aimco proportionate financial measures on a per-unit basis.
EFFECTIVE UNITS:
EBITDA is equal to Aimco's adjusted total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined in Aimco's credit agreement capital addition reserves provided for in Aimco's credit agreement. EBITDA is the numerator used in Aimco's calculation of EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio and EBITDA Coverage of Preferred Dividends and Interest Ratio.
EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA):
before
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
The ratio of (a) Aimco's EBITDA to (2) total interest expense charges, as provided for in Aimco's credit agreement, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation. This ratio is similar to Aimco's Debt Service Coverage Ratio with the exception that Aimco's EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio does not include capital addition reserves in the numerator and does not include debt amortization or capitalized interest in the denominator, while Debt Service Coverage Ratio does include these items. Aimco's credit agreement does not contain any compliance thresholds for the EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio; however, Aimco management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST RATIO:
The ratio of (a) Aimco's EBITDA to (2) the sum of total interest expense and dividends/distributions on preferred shares/units, as provided for in Aimco's credit agreement, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation. This ratio is similar to Aimco's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio with the exception that Aimco's EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends Ratio does not include capital addition reserves in the numerator and does not include debt amortization or capitalized interest in the denominator, while Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio does include these items. Aimco's credit agreement does not contain any compliance thresholds for the EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends Ratio; however, Aimco management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS RATIO:
As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Aimco's adjusted total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which is reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves) to (b) fixed charges, which represents the sum of total interest expense, debt amortization and dividends/distributions on preferred shares/units, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO:
Aimco provides property management and/or asset management services for a portfolio of properties, primarily pursuant to long-term arrangements with affiliated parties. In certain cases, Aimco may indirectly own generally less than one percent of the operations of such properties through a partnership syndication or other fund.
FEE MANAGED PROPERTIES:
FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO):
In addition to FFO, Aimco uses to measure performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO as defined above, excluding operating real estate impairments and preferred stock redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Both operating real estate impairment losses and preferred stock redemption related amounts are recurring items that affect Aimco's operating results. Operating real estate impairment losses, net of related income tax benefits and noncontrolling interests, are excluded from Pro forma FFO because Aimco believes the inclusion of such losses in FFO is inconsistent with the treatment of gains on the disposition of operating real estate, which are not included in FFO. Aimco excludes preferred redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of operating results.
PRO FORMA FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Pro forma FFO)
FFO and Pro forma FFO are helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because they capture features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. FFO and Pro forma FFO are reconciled to Net income (loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders as determined in accordance with in Supplemental Schedule 1.
Affordable Properties that do not meet the Same Store property definition because (1) the property is under redevelopment, (2) the property is not managed by Aimco, and/or (3) Aimco's ownership in the property is less than 10%.
OTHER AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
AIMCO 2nd Quarter 2010
 
Conventional Properties that have significant rent control restrictions, university housing properties and properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
OTHER CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships, certain other corporate expenses and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal).
OTHER EXPENSES, NET:
NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; off-site property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations and financing arrangements. NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. A reconciliation of NOI as presented in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information to Aimco's consolidated GAAP amounts is provided below and on the following page.
