Ladies and Gentlemen:

Incorporated ("Morgan Stanley") and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells Fargo"), and each of the other underwriters named in Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Underwriters," which term shall also include any underwriter substituted as hereinafter provided in Section 7 hereof), for whom Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are acting as representatives (in such capacity, the "Representatives"), with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of 4,000,000 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class U Preferred Stock"), and the purchase by the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, of the respective number of shares of Class U Preferred Stock set forth opposite the names of the Underwriters in Schedule A hereto. The Company previously issued and sold 8,000,000 shares of Class U Preferred Stock ("Existing Class U Preferred Stock"), all of which Existing Class U Preferred Stock are outstanding as of the date hereof. The Securities will have identical terms and conditions, other than issue date, issue price, and the date from which dividends payable on the Securities will begin to accumulate, as the Existing Class U Preferred Stock. The Securities and the Existing Class U Preferred Stock will together constitute a single class of preferred stock of the Company.
     The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of the Securities as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this underwriting agreement (the "Agreement") has been executed and delivered.
 
     The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-150341-01), including a base prospectus (the "Base Prospectus"), relating to certain securities, including the Class U Preferred Stock, and which incorporates by reference documents that the Company has filed or will file in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"). The Company has prepared and filed a preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus included as part of such registration statement, dated as of August 31, 2010, which preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relates to the Securities (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement"). Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file a prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus (the "Prospectus Supplement"). Except where the context otherwise requires, such registration statement, as amended when it became effective, including all documents filed as part thereof or incorporated by reference therein, and including any information contained in a Prospectus (as defined below) subsequently filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or deemed to be a part of such registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B (the "Rule 430B Information"), is herein called the "Registration Statement." The Registration Statement at the time it originally became effective is herein called the "Original Registration Statement." The Base Prospectus, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, included in the Registration Statement, as it may be supplemented by the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, in the form in which such Base Prospectus and Preliminary Prospectus Supplement have most recently been filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), is herein called the "Preliminary Prospectus." The Base Prospectus, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, included in the Registration Statement, as it may be supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, in the form in which such Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement have most recently been filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), is herein called the "Prospectus." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package (as defined below), the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein, and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing after the execution hereof of any document with the Commission deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. For purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or to any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR (as defined below).

"road show that is a written communication" within the meaning of Rule 433(d)(8)(i), whether or not required to be filed with the Commission, or (iii) is exempt from filing pursuant to Rule 433(d)(5)(i) because it contains a description of an offering of the Securities that does not reflect the final terms, in each case, in the form filed or required to be filed with the Commission or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g). The term "Free Writing Prospectus" means any free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405. The term "Applicable Time" means 8:45 a.m. on September 1, 2010.

The Company has not received from the Commission any notice pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) objecting to the use of the automatic shelf registration statement form. The Company has paid, or if the Prospectus Supplement has not yet been filed with the Commission will pay, the required Commission filing fees relating to the Securities within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1)(i) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(r) (including, if applicable, by updating the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in accordance with Rule 456(b)(1)(ii) either in a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement).
     (b) The Original Registration Statement became effective under Rule 462(e) upon receipt of filing by the Commission on April 21, 2008, and any post-effective amendment thereto also became effective upon filing under Rule 462(e).

Each of the properties of any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Subsidiaries complies with all applicable codes and zoning laws and regulations except in any case where such non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary has knowledge of any pending or threatened condemnation, zoning change or other proceeding or action that will in any manner affect the size of, use of, improvements on, construction on, or access to the properties of any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary except in any case where such action or proceeding would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All of the leases and subleases material to the business of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, and under which the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary holds properties described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, are in full force and effect, and none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary has any notice of any material claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary under any of the leases or subleases mentioned
 
above, or affecting or questioning the rights of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary of the continued possession of the leased or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (p) Title insurance in favor of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries has been obtained with respect to each property owned by any such entity in an amount that is customary for companies engaged in the same or similar businesses, except where the failure to maintain such title insurance would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (q) The mortgages and deeds of trust encumbering the properties and assets described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (i) are not convertible (in the absence of foreclosure) into an equity interest in the property or asset described therein or in the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary, nor does any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary hold a participating interest therein, (ii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, are not cross-defaulted to any indebtedness other than indebtedness of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and (iii) are not cross-collateralized to any property not owned by the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of the Subsidiaries, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries have filed all other tax returns that are required to have been filed by them pursuant to applicable foreign, state, local or other law except insofar as the failure to file such returns would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries, except for such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith or would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries in respect of any income, partnership and corporation tax liability for any years not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments or
 
re-assessments for additional income tax for any years not finally determined, except to the extent of any inadequacy that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

The Operating Partnership will be taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
     (u) Neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership is, or upon the issuance and sale of the Securities and the application of the Net Proceeds therefrom as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus will be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act.

     (x) The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries carry or are entitled to the benefits of insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is customary for companies engaged in the same or similar business, and all such insurance is in full force and effect. None of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will not be able (i) to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such policies expire or (ii) to obtain comparable coverage from similar institutions as may be necessary or appropriate to conduct its business as now conducted and at a cost that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (y) Each of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries possesses such permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations (collectively, "Governmental Licenses") issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, except where failure to possess any such Governmental Licenses would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; all of the Governmental Licenses are valid and in full force and effect, except when the invalidity of such Governmental Licenses or the failure of such Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect; and none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses which if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (z) No labor dispute with the employees of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary exists or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Operating Partnership, is imminent, which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (aa) There are no contracts or documents which are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein or to be filed as exhibits thereto which have not been so described and filed as required.
     (bb) The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries own or possess, or can acquire on reasonable terms, adequate patents, patent rights, licenses, inventions, copyrights, know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and/or unpatentable proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures), trademarks, service marks, trade names or other intellectual property (collectively, "Intellectual Property") necessary to carry on the business now operated by them, and none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary has received any written notice or is otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or circumstances which would render any Intellectual Property invalid or inadequate to protect the interest of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary therein, and which infringement or conflict (if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or
 
invalidity or inadequacy, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (cc) The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries employ disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
     (dd) None of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Significant Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company or the Operating Partnership, any director, officer, agent, employee, affiliate or other person acting on behalf of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary is aware of or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, that would reasonably be expected to result in a violation by such persons of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "FCPA"), including, without limitation, making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of anything of value to any "foreign official" (as such term is defined in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any candidate for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA, and the Company, the Operating Partnership, any Significant Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company or the Operating Partnership, the Company's affiliates have conducted their businesses in compliance with the FCPA and have instituted and maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably expected to continue to ensure, continued compliance therewith.

     (gg) There is and has been no failure on the part of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary or any of the directors or officers of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary, in their capacities as such, to comply in all material respects with any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), including Section 402 related to loans and Sections 302 and 906 related to certifications.
     (hh) Except as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, no holders of securities or other equity interests of the Company or the Operating Partnership have rights to have any such securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
     (ii) Any statistical and market-related data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus are based on or derived from sources that the Company believes to be reliable and accurate in all material respects, and the Company has obtained the written consent to the use of such data from such sources, where required.
     (jj) The outstanding shares of Class U Preferred Stock and the Securities to be sold by the Company hereunder have been or will have been approved for listing, subject only to official notice of issuance, on the NYSE, and are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company has taken no action designed to, or likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Securities under the Exchange Act or delisting any such securities from the NYSE, nor has the Company received any notification that the Commission or the NYSE is contemplating terminating such registration or listing.
     (kk) Except as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary is a party to any contract, agreement or understanding with any person (other than as contemplated by this Agreement) that would give rise to a valid claim against the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary or any Underwriter for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or like payment in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities.
 
     (ll) Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or the Operating Partnership delivered to the Underwriters or to counsel for the Underwriters pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or the Operating Partnership, as applicable, to the Underwriters as to the matters covered thereby as of the date or dates indicated in such certificate.

The time at which such payment and delivery are actually made is hereinafter sometimes called the "Closing Time."

definitive proxy or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities, of any notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the form of the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2), of the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amending or supplementing of the Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and, in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to the Securities or suspending any such qualification, or of the issuance of any such notice of objection, to promptly use every commercially reasonable effort to permit offers and sales of the Securities by the Underwriters, which effort may include, without limitation, obtaining the withdrawal of such order or notice, amending the Registration Statement or filing a new registration statement, at the Company's expense (references herein to the Registration Statement shall include any such amendment or new registration statement);
     (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the Representatives may reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may request and to comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Securities, that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject;
provided
     (c) The Company represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Company and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 405, in each case required to be filed with the Commission. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Company and the Underwriters is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company represents that it has treated or agrees that it will treat each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Rule 433, and has complied and will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission where required, legending and record keeping;

Securities, the Company will furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus in New York City as amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or sale of the Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in the Prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many written and electronic copies as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance;
     (e) To timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes of, and to provide to the Underwriters the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act;

     (j) The Company intends to operate in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code for each of its taxable years for so long as the Board of Directors of the Company deems it in the best interests of the Company's security holders to remain so qualified;

     (l) To not, directly or indirectly, during the "restricted period," as defined with respect to the Company in Rule 100 of Regulation M, (i) take any action designed to cause or result in, or that constitutes or might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities or (ii) sell, bid for, or purchase the Securities to be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement, or pay anyone any compensation for soliciting purchases of the Securities to be issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement other than Underwriters; that the Company may bid for and purchase its Common Stock in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act;
provided
     (m) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Securities remain unsold, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new automatic shelf registration statement relating to the Securities. If the Company is no longer eligible to file an automatic shelf registration statement, the Company will, prior to the Renewal Deadline, if it has not already done so, file a new shelf registration statement relating to the Securities, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the issuance and sale of the Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be; and
     (n) The Company and the Operating Partnership acknowledge and agree that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company and the Operating Partnership with respect to the offering of the Securities (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other person. Additionally, no Underwriter is advising the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company and the Operating Partnership shall consult with their own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company or the Operating Partnership with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the Operating Partnership, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company or the Operating Partnership.
     4. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Securities Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 3(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in
 
connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or state securities law surveys; (iii) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (iv) any filing fees incident to any required review by FINRA of the terms of the sale of the Securities; (v) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section; and (vi) the costs and expenses (including without limitation any damages or other amounts payable in connection with legal or contractual liability) associated with the reforming of any contracts for sale of the Securities made by the Underwriters caused by a breach of the representation contained in Section 1(b) hereof. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section and Sections 8 and 11 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     5.

     (a) The Company and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any director, officer, employee or affiliate thereof as follows:
     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) of this Section 6(a),
, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, further, that the parties hereby agree that the only such information in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus is that set forth in the fourth and eighth paragraphs and
provided, however
 
the first, fourth and fifth sentences of the twelfth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus, and the Underwriters hereby consent to the use in the Prospectus of such information.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Operating Partnership, each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any officer, director or employee thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters expressly for use therein as set forth in clause (a) above.
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iv) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm (in addition to local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without
 
the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 hereof whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto, unless (x) such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party and (y) the indemnifying party confirms in writing its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such settlement, compromise or judgment. Notwithstanding Section 6(a) hereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested that an indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless (A) such failure to reimburse the indemnified party is based on a dispute with a good faith basis as to either the obligation of the indemnifying party arising under this Section 6 to indemnify the indemnified party or the amount of such obligation and (B) the indemnifying party shall have notified the indemnified party of such good faith dispute prior to the date of such settlement.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or (b) hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
          The relative benefits received by the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by the Underwriters from the sale of Securities on behalf of the Company.
          The relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
 
whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
          Each of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
          No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
          For purposes of this subsection (d), each director, officer, employee or affiliate of the Underwriters and each person, if any who controls the Underwriters within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters, and each officer and director of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the preceding two paragraphs.
          For purposes of this Section 6, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall be deemed one party, jointly and severally liable for any obligations hereunder.
     7. (a) If any Underwriter shall default at the applicable Closing Time in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the
 
Company that they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase a principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase under this Agreement and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 4 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 6 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     8. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     9. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter with respect to the Securities except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof. If this Agreement shall be terminated as a result of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof (other than Section 5(b) or 5(i)(i), (iii), (iv) or (v)) not being satisfied, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the
 
Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
     10. In all dealings hereunder the Representatives shall act on behalf of each Underwriter, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile transmission to the Representatives at: Morgan Stanley & Co.

No purchaser of Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

Apartment Investment and Management Company
     Re: Offering of Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special Maryland counsel to Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and have been requested to render this opinion in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Company (Registration No. 333-150341-01) and all amendments through the date hereof (the "Registration Statement"), prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and made effective on April 21, 2008, including a preliminary prospectus, dated April 18, 2008, included therein at the time the Registration Statement was declared effective (the "Base Prospectus"), the preliminary prospectus supplement, filed by the Company with the Commission on August 31, 2010 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prosepctus, the "Preliminary Prospectus"), and the prospectus supplement, filed by the Company with the Commission on September 1, 2010 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Supplement", and together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), for offering by the Company of 4,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated September 1, 2010 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters (the "Underwriters"), on the one hand, and the Company and AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, on the other hand. This opinion is being provided at your request in connection with the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K and supplements our opinion, dated April 18, 2008, previously filed as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement.
     In rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have reviewed the following documents (the "Documents"):
     (a) the charter of the Company, including the Articles Supplementary of the Company relating to the Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock filed on March 18, 2004 and September 2, 2010, respectively, with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "SDAT"), all as certified by the SDAT (collectively, the "Charter");
     (b) the Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), as in effect on the date hereof, as certified by an officer of the Company;
     (c) the Underwriting Agreement;
     (d) the Registration Statement;
 
September 3, 2010 Page 2
Apartment Investment and Management Company
     (e) the Prospectus;
     (f) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the authorization and issuance of the Shares and the authorization of the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, certified by an officer of the Company;
     (h) a certificate of the SDAT as to the good standing of the Company, dated as of a recent date;
     (i) a certificate executed by an officer of the Company (the "Certificate"), dated as of the date hereof, as to certain factual matters; and
     (j) such other documents as we have considered necessary to the rendering of the opinion expressed below.
     In examining the Documents, and in rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following: (a) each of the parties to the Documents (other than the Company) has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents and each instrument, agreement, and other document executed in connection with the Documents to which such party is a signatory and each such party's (other than the Company's) obligations set forth in the Documents, are its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms; (b) each person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document on behalf of any such party (other than the Company) is duly authorized to do so; (c) each natural person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document is legally competent to do so; (d) the Documents accurately describe and contain the mutual understandings of the parties, there are no oral or written modifications of or amendments or supplements to the Documents and there has been no waiver of any of the provisions of the Documents by actions or conduct of the parties or otherwise; and (e) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or telecopies or portable document file (".PDF") copies conform to the original documents (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), all signatures on all documents submitted to us for examination (and including signatures on photocopies, telecopies and .PDF copies) are genuine, and all public records reviewed are accurate and complete. As to certain factual matters we have relied on the Certificate as to the factual matters set forth therein, which we assume to be accurate and complete.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Shares have been duly authorized and upon issuance and delivery against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
     The opinion set forth herein is subject to additional assumptions, qualifications, and limitations as follows:
     (a) We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Maryland. To the extent that any documents referred to herein are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland, we have assumed that the laws of such jurisdiction are the same as the laws of the State of Maryland.
 
September 3, 2010 Page 3
Apartment Investment and Management Company
     (b) We further assume that the issuance and sale of the Shares will not cause the Company to exceed the total limit of the authorized capital stock of the Company, as provided in the Charter.
     (c) This opinion concerns only the effect of the laws (exclusive of the principles of conflict of laws) of the State of Maryland as currently in effect. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if any facts or circumstances come to our attention after the date hereof that might change this opinion.
     (d) We express no opinion as to compliance with the securities (or "blue sky") laws or the real estate syndication laws of the State of Maryland.
     (e) We assume that the issuance of the Shares by the Company will not cause any person to violate any of the provisions of the Charter relating to the Initial Holder Limit, the Look-Through Ownership Limit, or the Ownership Limit (as those terms are defined in the Charter) and that the Company will not issue any shares of capital stock other than the Shares.
     (f) This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.

Exhibit 8.1
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          You have requested our opinion concerning certain Federal income tax considerations in connection with the offering (the "Offering") by Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("AIMCO"), to the several Underwriters named in Schedule A (the "Underwriters") of the Underwriting Agreement among Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as representatives of the several Underwriters, AIMCO, and AIMCO Properties, L.P., dated as of September 1, 2010, of 4,000,000 shares of AIMCO's Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Securities"), pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-150341-01) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 18, 2008 (the "Registration Statement"), the base prospectus dated as of April 18, 2008 (the "Base Prospectus"), and the prospectus supplement dated as of September 1, 2010 (the "Prospectus Supplement," and together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"). All capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise specified, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Prospectus.
          In connection with the Offering and with certain previous offerings of AIMCO stock and securities, we have acted as counsel to AIMCO, and we have assisted in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and certain other
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company September 3, 2010 Page 2
documents. In formulating our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and such other documentation and information provided by you as is relevant to the Offering and necessary to prepare the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In addition, you have provided us with certain representations and covenants of officers of AIMCO relating to, among other things, properties, assets, income, distributions, stockholder ownership, organizational structure and other requirements, and the past, present and future conduct of AIMCO's business operations. We have assumed that such statements, representations and covenants are true as of the date hereof, and will continue to be true, without regard to any qualification as to knowledge and belief. For purposes of our opinion, we have not assumed any responsibility for investigating or independently verifying the facts and representations set forth in such documents, the partnership agreements and organizational documents for each of the corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies in which AIMCO holds a direct or indirect interest (the "Subsidiaries"), the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any other document, and we have not undertaken any independent review of such information. We have, consequently, assumed and relied on AIMCO's representations that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have also relied upon the opinion of Altheimer & Gray dated May 8, 1998, with respect to the qualification of Ambassador Apartments, Inc., a Maryland corporation, as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for its taxable year ended December 31, 1994 and all subsequent taxable years ending on or before May 8, 1998 (including the short taxable year ending on May 8, 1998). In addition, we have assumed the qualification of Insignia Properties Trust as a REIT under the Code and have relied upon the opinion of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. dated August 4, 1998, in this regard.
          In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the foregoing documents have been or will be consummated in accordance with the operative documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, our opinion is based on the correctness of the assumption that there have been no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or any other state under the laws of which any of the Subsidiaries have been formed. In rendering our opinion, we have also considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations"), administrative rulings and the other interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service, all as they exist as of the date hereof. With respect to the assumption, it should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect). Any change which is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions herein. There can be no assurances, moreover, that any of
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company September 3, 2010 Page 3
the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court.
          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, for Federal income tax purposes we are of the opinion that:
          1. Commencing with AIMCO's initial taxable year ended December 31, 1994, AIMCO was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable, AIMCO to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. AIMCO's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, certain requirements including requirements relating to distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of AIMCO's operation for any particular taxable year satisfy the requirements for taxation of a REIT under the Code.
          2. Although the discussion set forth in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Certain Federal Income Taxation Considerations," as supplemented by the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations," does not purport to discuss all possible United States Federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Securities, the discussion, although general in nature, constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary under current law of certain material United States Federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Securities by a holder who acquires such Securities, subject to the qualifications set forth therein. The United States Federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Securities by an investor will depend upon that holder's particular situation, and we express no opinion as to the completeness of the discussion set forth in "Certain Federal Income Taxation Considerations," as supplemented by the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations," as applied to any particular holder.
          Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to AIMCO or to any investment therein.
          This opinion has been prepared for you in connection with the transaction described herein. It may not be relied upon by anyone else without our prior written consent. We consent to AIMCO filing this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company September 3, 2010 Page 4
category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP

Forward-Looking Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date and include certain risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Aimco's ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rates and property operating results. Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond the control of Aimco, including, without limitation: financing risks, including the availability and cost of capital markets financing and the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which Aimco operates; the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; insurance risk, including the cost of insurance; natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; energy costs; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by Aimco.
     In addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.
     Readers should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and notes thereto, as well as the risk factors described in Aimco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements reflect management's judgment as of this date, and Aimco assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect future events or circumstances.
