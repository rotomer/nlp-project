ITEM 8.01. Other Events
Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") is re-issuing its historical financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, to reflect additional properties sold or classified as held for sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 as discontinued operations in accordance with the requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification 205-20, . These reclassifications have no effect on Aimco's reported net income available to common stockholders or funds from operations.
Discontinued Operations
Additionally, Aimco revised its reportable business segments during the three months ended March 31, 2010. Aimco determined its investment management reporting unit no longer met the requirements for a reportable segment; and in order to provide more meaningful information regarding its real estate operations, Aimco elected to disaggregate information for the prior real estate segment. As a result of these changes, Aimco now has two reportable segments: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations. Accordingly, Aimco has updated Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in exhibit 99.1 to be consistent with the new presentation.
As a result of the changes discussed above, Aimco is updating "Item 6  Selected Financial Data," "Item 7  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." All other information contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 has not been updated or modified. For more recent information regarding Aimco, please see Aimco's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other reports and information filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission since February 26, 2010.

Selected Financial Data
The following selected financial data is based on our audited historical financial statements. This information should be read in conjunction with such financial statements, including the notes thereto, and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included herein or in previous filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Executive Overview
We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. Our property operations are characterized by diversification of product, location and price point. We primarily invest in the 20 largest U.S. markets, as measured by total market capitalization, which is the total market value of institutional-grade apartment properties in a particular market. We define these markets as "target markets" and they possess the following characteristics: a high concentration of population and apartment units; geographic and employment diversification; and historically strong returns with reduced volatility as part of a diversified portfolio. We are one of the largest owners and operators of apartment properties in the United States. As of December 31, 2009, we owned or managed 870 apartment properties containing 135,654 units located in 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases.
The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: NAV; Funds From Operations, or FFO; Adjusted FFO, or AFFO, which is FFO less spending for Capital Replacements; same store property operating results; net operating income; Free Cash Flow, which is net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. FFO and Capital Replacements are defined and further described in the sections captioned "Funds From Operations" and "Capital Additions" below. The key macro-economic factors and non-financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: household formations; rates of job growth; single-family and multifamily housing starts; interest rates; and availability and cost of financing.
Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings.
During the challenging financial and economic environment in 2009, we focused on: serving and retaining residents; continually improving our portfolio; reducing leverage and financial risk; and simplifying our business model.
We are focused on owning and operating B/B+ quality apartments concentrated in our target markets. We intend to upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the sale of approximately 5% to 10% of our portfolio annually, with the proceeds generally used to increase our allocation of capital to well located properties within our target markets through capital investments, redevelopment or acquisitions.
The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
 
Results of Operations
Overview
2009 compared to 2008
We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $64.3 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to net income attributable to Aimco of $412.0 million and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $351.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreases of $476.3 million and $466.1 million, respectively. These decreases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below:
The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by:
2008 compared to 2007
We reported net income attributable to Aimco of $412.0 million and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $351.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to net income attributable to Aimco of $29.9 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $40.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, increases of $382.1 million and $391.9 million, respectively. These increases were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below:
The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by:
 
The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail.
Business Segment Operating Results
As of December 31, 2009, we had two reportable segments: real estate (owning, operating and redeveloping apartments) and investment management (portfolio management and asset management). Based on a planned reduction in our transactional activities, during the three months ended March 31, 2010, we reevaluated our reportable segments and determined our investment management reporting unit no longer meets the requirements for a reportable segment. Additionally, to provide more meaningful information regarding our real estate operations, we elected to disaggregate information for the prior real estate segment. Following these changes, we have two reportable segments: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations, which are discussed in further detail below.
Real Estate Operations
Our real estate portfolio is comprised of two business components: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations, which also represent our two reportable segments. Our conventional real estate portfolio consists of market-rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and includes 226 properties with 70,758 units. Our affordable real estate portfolio consists of 244 properties with 28,034 units, with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Our conventional and affordable properties contributed 87% and 13%, respectively, of our property net operating income attributed to the Partnership's common unitholders during the year ended December 31, 2009.
Our chief operating decision maker uses various generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance and financial condition of the business, including: net operating income; Net Asset Value; Pro forma Funds From Operations; Adjusted Funds From Operations; same store property operating results; Free Cash Flow; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. Our chief operating decision maker emphasizes net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Segment net operating income is generally defined as segment revenues less direct segment operating expenses.
The following table summarizes the net operating income of our real estate operations, including our conventional and affordable segments, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, our real estate operations net operating income increased $12.8 million, or 2.2%, due to an increase in rental and other property revenues of $1.3 million, or 0.1%, and a decrease in property operating expenses of $11.5 million, or 2.2%.
 
Our conventional real estate operations net operating income decreased $8.0 million, or 1.4%, from $553.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 to $545.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. This decrease was primarily attributable to our conventional same store properties, including an $10.1 million, or 1.4%, decrease in revenues due to lower average rent (approximately $19 per unit) and a decrease of 30 basis points in average physical occupancy, and $1.4 million increase in expenses due to increases in payroll, repairs and maintenance, and insurance expenses, partially offset by decreases in contract services, marketing and administrative expenses. The decrease in conventional net operating income associated with our same store properties was partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in net operating income associated with our conventional non-same store properties. Revenues of our conventional non-same store properties increased $5.5 million, primarily due to an $8.1 million increase in redevelopment revenues, primarily due to more units in service at these properties in 2009, partially offset by a $2.0 million increase in expenses related to our non-same store properties, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and expenses related to properties newly consolidated in 2009.
Our affordable real estate operations net operating income increased $6.6 million, or 7.4%, from $88.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, to $95.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in net operating income was primarily due to increases in revenues of our affordable properties of $7.1 million, including a $5.0 million increase primarily due to higher average rents partially offset by lower physical occupancy, and a $2.1 million increase related to properties that were newly consolidated in 2009.
Real estate operations net operating income includes property management revenues and expenses and casualty losses, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance. Property management revenues decreased by $1.3 million, due to a reduction in the number of properties managed due to sales. Expenses not allocated to our conventional or affordable segments decreased by $15.4 million, primarily due to a $16.6 million decrease in property management expenses, resulting primarily from reductions in personnel and related costs attributed to our restructuring activities (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, our real estate operations net operating income increased $22.4 million, or 4.1%, due to an increase in rental and other property revenues of $42.2 million, or 4.0%, partially offset by an increase in property operating expenses of $19.8 million, or 3.9%.
Our conventional real estate operations net operating income increased $25.2 million, or 4.8%, from $528.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $553.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to our conventional same store properties, including a $22.2 million, or 3.1%, increase in revenues due to higher average rent (approximately $21 per unit) and an increase of 80 basis points in average physical occupancy, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in expenses due to increases in utility, real estate tax, marketing, administrative and contract service expenses, offset by decreases in payroll, turnover and repair and maintenance expenses. In addition to the increase in conventional same store net operating income, net operating income related to our conventional non-same store properties increased by $4.7 million. Revenues of our conventional non-same store properties increased $9.0 million, primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in redevelopment revenues due to more units in service during 2008, partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in expenses of our conventional non-same store properties primarily due to increases in payroll, real estate tax, contract services and marketing expenses.
Our affordable real estate operations net operating income increased $2.8 million, or 3.3%, from $85.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, to $88.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Revenues of our affordable properties increased by $11.5 million and expenses of our affordable properties increased by $8.7 million, primarily due to properties newly consolidated during late 2007.
Real estate operations net operating income includes property management revenues and expenses and casualty losses, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance. Property management revenues decreased by $0.6 million, primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of properties managed due to sales. Expenses not allocated to our conventional or affordable segments increased by $5.0 million, primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in casualty losses, primarily due to properties damaged by Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and a $2.2 million increase in property management expenses.
Asset Management and Tax Credit Revenues
We perform activities and services for consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities. Within our owned portfolio, we refer to these activities as "Portfolio Management," and their benefit is seen in property operating results and in gains on dispositions. For affiliated partnerships, we refer to these activities as asset management, for which we are separately compensated through fees paid by third party investors. These activities are conducted in part by our taxable subsidiaries, and the related net operating income may be subject to income taxes.
 
Asset management revenue may include certain fees that were earned in a prior period, but not recognized at that time because collectibility was not reasonably assured. Those fees may be recognized in a subsequent period upon occurrence of a transaction or a high level of the probability of occurrence of a transaction, or improvement in operations that generates sufficient cash to pay the fees.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, asset management and tax credit revenues decreased $49.0 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $42.8 million decrease in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures, due to fewer related sales in 2009, a $7.6 million decrease in other general partner transactional fees and a $2.2 million decrease in asset management fees, offset by a $3.6 million increase in revenues associated with our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, asset management and tax credit revenues increased $25.1 million. This increase is primarily attributable to a $30.7 million increase in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures, and a $10.3 million increase in other general partner transactional fees. These increases are offset by a decrease of $10.0 million in asset management fees and a decrease of $5.9 million in revenues associated with our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements.
Investment Management Expenses
Investment management expenses consist primarily of the costs of departments that perform asset management and tax credit activities. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, investment management expenses decreased $9.0 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs from our organizational restructurings and a reduction in transaction costs related to our retroactive adoption of SFAS 141(R) (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, investment management expenses increased $4.3 million, primarily due to a $3.5 million increase in acquisition costs.
Other Operating Expenses (Income)
Depreciation and Amortization
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation and amortization increased $50.8 million, or 13.3%. This increase primarily consists of depreciation related to properties acquired during the latter part of 2008, completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, depreciation and amortization increased $45.3 million, or 13.4%. This increase reflects depreciation of $65.1 million for newly acquired properties, completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $25.7 million in depreciation adjustments necessary to reduce the carrying amount of buildings and improvements to their estimated disposition value, or zero in the case of a planned demolition, primarily due to a property that became fully depreciated during 2007.
Provision for Operating Real Estate Impairment Losses
Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, we recognized impairment losses of $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use as of December 31, 2009. We recognized no such impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets
In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in our Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the decline in land values in Southern California during 2008 and the expected timing of our redevelopment efforts, we determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, recognized an impairment loss of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax).
Similarly, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the three months ended December 31, 2008.
The impairments discussed above totaled $91.1 million and are included in provisions for impairment losses on real estate development assets in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in Item 8. We recognized no similar impairments on real estate development assets during the years ended December 31, 2009 or 2007.
General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, general and administrative expenses decreased $23.7 million, or 29.5%. This decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in personnel and related expenses associated with our organizational restructurings (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), pursuant to which we eliminated approximately 400, or 36%, of our offsite positions between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, general and administrative expenses increased $8.0 million, or 11.1%. This increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel and related expenses of $6.1 million and an increase of $1.5 million in information technology communications costs.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non-recurring items.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, other expenses, net decreased by $6.3 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $5.4 million write-off during 2008 of certain communications hardware and capitalized costs in 2008, and a $5.3 million reduction in expenses of our self insurance activities, including a decrease in casualty losses on less than wholly owned properties from 2008 to 2009. These decreases are partially offset by an increase of $4.8 million in costs related to certain litigation matters.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, other expenses, net increased by $3.1 million. The increase includes a $5.4 million write-off of certain communications hardware and capitalized costs during 2008 and a $1.2 million write-off of redevelopment costs associated with a change in the planned use of a property during 2008. The net unfavorable change also reflects $3.6 million of income recognized in 2007 related to the transfer of certain property rights to an unrelated party. These increases were partially offset by a $3.7 million reduction in expenses of our self insurance activities (net of costs in 2008 related to Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike) and a net decrease of $2.0 million in costs related to certain litigation matters.
Restructuring Costs
For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized restructuring costs of $11.2 million, as compared to $22.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2008, related to our organizational restructurings, which are further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We recognized no restructuring costs during the year ended December 31, 2007.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable from non-affiliates and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts, and accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion occur infrequently and thus accretion income may vary from period to period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, interest income decreased $10.5 million, or 53.7%. Interest income decreased by $8.7 million due to lower interest rates on notes receivable, cash and restricted cash balances and lower average balances and by $4.1 million due to a decrease in accretion income related to our note receivable from Casden Properties LLC for which we ceased accretion following impairment of the note in 2008. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accretion income related to other notes during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from a change in the timing and amount of collection.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, interest income decreased $23.2 million, or 54.1%. Interest income decreased by $15.9 million due to lower interest rates on notes receivable, cash and restricted cash balances and lower average balances. Interest income also decreased by $5.8 million due to an adjustment of accretion on certain discounted notes during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from a change in the estimated timing and amount of collection, and by $1.5 million for accretion income recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007, related to the prepayment of principal on certain discounted loans collateralized by properties in West Harlem in New York City.
Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $21.5 million, $17.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The provisions for losses on notes receivable for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, primarily consist of impairments related to our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which are discussed further below.
As part of the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc., we invested $50.0 million for a 20% passive interest in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to acquire, re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we account for this investment as a note receivable and through 2008 were amortizing the discounted value of the investment to the $50.0 million previously estimated to be collectible, through January 2, 2009, the initial dissolution date of the entity. In 2009, the managing member extended the dissolution date. In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements and as a result of a decline in land values in Southern California, we determined our recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2008. In connection with the preparation of our 2009 annual financial statements and as a result of continued declines in land values in Southern California, we determined our then recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2009.
In addition to the impairments related to Casden Properties LLC discussed above, we recognized provisions for losses on notes receivable totaling $0.8 million, $1.3 million and $2.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Interest Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, totaled $315.4 million and $315.0 million, respectively. Interest expense increased by $14.5 million due to a reduction in redevelopment activity during 2009, which resulted in a reduction in capitalized interest. In addition, interest expense increased by $1.2 million due to an increase in prepayment penalties associated with refinancing activities, from $2.8 million in 2008 to $4.0 million in 2009, and by $4.0 million related to non-recourse property loans, from $301.9 million to $305.9 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower average balances during 2009. These increases in interest expense were substantially offset by decreases in corporate interest expense. Interest expense related to corporate debt, which is primarily floating rate, decreased by $19.4 million, from $34.8 million to $15.4 million, primarily due to lower average balances and interest rates during 2009.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, interest expense increased $10.3 million, or 3.4%. Interest expense related to non-recourse property loans increased by $16.2 million, from $285.7 million to $301.9 million, primarily due to higher average balances partially offset by lower average interest rates during 2008. In addition, interest expense increased by $4.6 million, due to a decrease in capitalized interest from $29.1 million in 2007 to $24.5 million in 2008, resulting from more units in service and lower interest rates. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense related to corporate debt, which is primarily floating rate and which decreased by $10.4 million, from $45.2 million to $34.8 million, primarily due to lower average balances and interest rates during 2008.
 
Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
Equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships includes our share of net losses of our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and is primarily driven by depreciation expense in excess of the net operating income recognized by such partnerships.
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships of $12.0 million, $4.6 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The $7.4 million increase in our equity in losses from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to our sale in late 2008 of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership that generated $3.0 million of equity in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2008, and our sale during 2009 of our interest in an unconsolidated group purchasing organization which resulted in a decrease of equity in earnings of approximately $1.2 million. The increase in equity in losses also includes additional losses recognized during 2009 related to the underlying investment properties of certain tax credit syndications we consolidated during 2009 and 2008.
Impairment Losses Related to Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
Impairment losses related to unconsolidated real estate partnerships includes our share of impairment losses recognized by our unconsolidated real estate partnerships. For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, impairment losses related to unconsolidated real estate partnerships decreased $2.3 million, and for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, impairment losses related to unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $2.7 million. This decrease and increase are primarily attributable to impairment losses recognized by unconsolidated partnerships on their underlying real estate properties during 2008.
Gain on Dispositions of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other
Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other includes our share of gains related to dispositions of real estate by unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non-depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $77.4 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a gain of $98.4 million on our disposition in 2008 of interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships. This decrease was partially offset by $18.7 million of gains on the disposition of interests in unconsolidated partnerships during 2009. Gains recognized in 2009 consist of $8.6 million related to our receipt in 2009 of additional proceeds related to our disposition during 2008 of one of the partnership interests discussed above (see Note 3 to the consolidated financials statements in Item 8), $4.0 million from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), and $6.1 million from our disposition in 2009 of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other increased $76.5 million. This increase is primarily attributable to a $98.4 million net gain on the disposition of interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2007, we recognized a $6.0 million non-refundable option and extension fee resulting from the termination of rights under an option agreement to sell the North and Central towers of our Flamingo South Beach property, approximately $6.4 million of net gains on dispositions of land parcels and our share of gains on dispositions of properties by unconsolidated real estate partnerships in 2007, and a $9.5 million gain on debt extinguishment related to properties in the VMS partnership (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
 
Income Tax Benefit
Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, such as property management, asset management and risk management, are conducted through, and certain of our properties are owned by, taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and conduct certain activities that generally cannot be offered directly by the REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties. Income taxes related to the results of continuing operations of our TRS entities are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, income tax benefit decreased by $34.5 million. This decrease was primarily attributed to $36.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2008 related to the impairments of our Lincoln Place property and our investment in Casden Properties LLC, both of which are owned through TRS entities, partially offset by $8.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2009 related to the impairment of our investment in Casden Properties LLC.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, income tax benefit increased by $33.4 million. This increase was primarily attributed to $36.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2008 related to the impairments of our Lincoln Place property and our investment in Casden Properties LLC.
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net
The results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property-related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property-specific interest expense and debt extinguishment gains and losses to the extent there is secured debt on the property. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale and the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations.
For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, income from discontinued operations totaled $153.9 million and $746.2 million, respectively. The $592.3 million decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $541.2 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to fewer properties sold in 2009 as compared to 2008, and a $111.8 million decrease in operating income (inclusive of a $27.1 million increase in real estate impairment losses), partially offset by a $59.1 million decrease in interest expense.
For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, income from discontinued operations totaled $746.2 million and $175.6 million, respectively. The $570.6 million increase in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $641.7 million increase in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to more properties sold in 2008 as compared to 2007 and a $27.1 million decrease in interest expense. These increases were partially offset by a $66.7 million decrease in operating income (inclusive of a $22.0 million increase in real estate impairment losses) and a $32.7 million decrease related to a 2007 gain on debt extinguishment related to properties in the VMS partnership.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 89 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $1.3 billion and net proceeds of $432.7 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $216.0 million (which is net of $5.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 151 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $2.4 billion and net proceeds of $1.1 billion, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $757.2 million (which is net of $43.1 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold 73 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $480.0 million and net proceeds of $203.8 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $115.5 million (which is net of $2.1 million of related income taxes).
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, income from discontinued operations includes the operating results of the properties sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2010.
Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on discontinued operations).
 
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects the non-Aimco partners', or noncontrolling partners', share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships. This generally includes the noncontrolling partners' share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 160, which are now codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification, or FASB ASC, Topic 810, effective January 1, 2009. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 160, we generally did not recognize a benefit for the noncontrolling interest partners' share of partnership losses for partnerships that have deficit noncontrolling interest balances and we generally recognized a charge to our earnings for distributions paid to noncontrolling partners for partnerships that had deficit noncontrolling interest balances. Under the updated provisions of FASB ASC Topic 810, we are required to attribute losses to noncontrolling interests even if such attribution would result in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance and we are no longer required to recognize a charge to our earnings for distributions paid to noncontrolling partners for partnerships that have deficit noncontrolling interest balances.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, net earnings attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased by $133.2 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of $108.7 million related to the noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships' share of gains on dispositions of real estate, due primarily to fewer sales in 2009 as compared to 2008, $5.5 million of losses allocated to noncontrolling interests in 2009 that we would not have allocated to the noncontrolling interest partners in 2008 because to do so would have resulted in deficits in their noncontrolling interest balances, and approximately $3.8 million related to deficit distribution charges recognized as a reduction to our earnings in 2008, for which we did not recognize similar charges in 2009 based on the change in accounting discussed above. These decreases are in addition to the noncontrolling interest partners' share of increased losses of our consolidated real estate partnerships in 2009 as compared to 2008.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, net income attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships increased by $63.6 million. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $105.6 million related to the noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships' share of gains on dispositions of real estate, due primarily to more sales in 2008 as compared to 2007, partially offset by increases of $42.0 million in net recoveries of deficit distributions.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, during the first quarter 2010, we will adopt new accounting guidance related to accounting for variable interest entities. This change in accounting guidance may result in our consolidation of certain previously unconsolidated entities as well as our deconsolidation of certain we currently consolidate. At this time, we have not yet determined the effect this accounting change will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership
Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership consist of common OP Units, High Performance Units and preferred OP Units. We allocate the Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss to the holders of common OP Units and High Performance Units based on the weighted average number of common OP Units and High Performance Units outstanding during the period. Holders of the preferred OP Units participate in the Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss only to the extent of their preferred distributions.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, the effect on our earnings of income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership changed favorably by $62.3 million. This favorable change is attributable to a decrease of $51.1 million related to the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of income from discontinued operations (net of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships), due primarily to larger gains on sales in 2008 relative to 2009 and $11.2 million in deficit distribution charges recognized during 2008 due to distributions in excess of the positive balance in noncontrolling interest. These changes were also affected by a decrease in the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership's effective ownership interest from 2008 to 2009.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, the effect on our earnings of income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership changed unfavorably by $55.8 million. This unfavorable change is attributable to an increase of $48.1 million related to the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of income from discontinued operations (net of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships), due primarily to larger gains on sales in 2008 relative to 2007, $11.5 million in deficit distribution charges recognized during 2008 due to distributions in excess of the positive balance in noncontrolling interest, and a $0.5 million increase in distributions to holders of preferred OP Units. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of losses from continuing operations (net of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships) in 2008 as compared to 2007.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
From time to time, we have non-revenue producing properties that we hold for future redevelopment. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of these redevelopment properties by comparing our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows based on the expected service potential of the redevelopment property upon completion to the carrying amount. In certain instances, we use a probability-weighted approach to determine our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows when alternative courses of action are under consideration. As discussed in within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, during 2008 we recognized impairment losses on our Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas properties of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax) and $5.7 million, respectively.
Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets
Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include:
Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long-lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. In addition to the impairments of Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas discussed above, based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, we recorded net impairment losses of $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use, and during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded no additional impairments related to properties held for use.
Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition
Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner. Notes receivable from non-affiliates consist of notes receivable from unrelated third parties. The ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as "par value notes," and loans extended by predecessors, some of whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as "discounted notes."
 
We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income.
We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has closed transactions or has entered into certain pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method. Accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible amount of the notes; therefore, accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods.
Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable
We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 we recorded net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $21.5 million, $17.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. As discussed in within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, provisions for losses on notes receivable in 2009 and 2008 include impairment losses of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) and $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax), respectively, on our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which we account for as a note receivable. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors.
Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable
Capitalized Costs
We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the property level. We characterize as "indirect costs" an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital additions activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses (see in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
Capital Additions and Related Depreciation
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $9.8 million, $25.7 million and $30.8 million of interest costs, respectively, and $40.0 million, $78.1 million and $78.1 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. The reduction is primarily due to a reduced level of redevelopment activities.
 
Funds From Operations
FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002, White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and premiums or discounts on preferred stock redemptions or repurchases. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other REITs.
In addition to FFO, we compute an alternate measure of FFO, which we refer to as Proforma FFO and which is FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding operating real estate impairments and preferred stock redemption related amounts (adjusted for the noncontrolling interests). Both operating real estate impairment losses and preferred stock redemption related amounts are recurring items that affect our operating results. We exclude operating real estate impairment losses, net of related income tax benefits and noncontrolling interests, from our calculation of Proforma FFO because we believe the inclusion of such losses in FFO is inconsistent with the treatment of gains on the disposition of operating real estate, which are not included in FFO. We exclude preferred redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from our calculation of Proforma FFO because such amounts are not representative of our operating results. Similar to FFO, we believe Proforma FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Not all REITs present an alternate measure of FFO similar to our Proforma FFO measure and there can be no assurance our basis for calculating Proforma FFO is comparable to those of other REITs.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our FFO and Proforma FFO are calculated as follows (in thousands):
 
Notes:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing property loans and borrowings under new property loans.
Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt, capital additions, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners, repurchases of shares of our Common Stock, and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short-term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short-term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short-term liquidity demands. We may use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long-term borrowings, primarily secured, the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations.
 
The state of credit markets and related effect on the overall economy may have an adverse affect on our liquidity, both through increases in interest rates and credit risk spreads, and access to financing. As further discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we are subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate liabilities, preferred stock and assets. Based on our net variable rate liabilities, preferred stock and assets outstanding at December 31, 2009, we estimate that a 1.0 % increase in 30-day LIBOR with constant credit risk spreads would reduce our income attributable to Aimco common stockholders by approximately $1.5 million on an annual basis. Although base interest rates have generally decreased relative to their levels prior to the disruptions in the financial markets, the tightening of credit markets has affected the credit risk spreads charged over base interest rates on, and the availability of, property loan financing. For future refinancing activities, our liquidity and cost of funds may be affected by increases in base interest rates or higher credit risk spreads. If timely property financing options are not available for maturing debt, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in certain capital spending or proceeds from asset dispositions.
As further discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we use total rate of return swaps as a financing product to lower our cost of borrowing through conversion of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds payable and fixed rate notes payable to variable interest rates indexed to the SIFMA rate for tax-exempt bonds payable and the 30-day LIBOR rate for notes payable, plus a credit risk spread. The cost of financing through these arrangements is generally lower than the fixed rate on the debt. As of December 31, 2009, we had total rate of return swap positions with two financial institutions with notional amounts totaling $353.1 million. Swaps with notional amounts of $307.9 million and $45.2 million had maturity dates in May 2012 and October 2012, respectively.
The total rate of return swaps require specified loan-to-value ratios. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline or if we sell properties in the collateral pool with low loan-to-value ratios, certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have an obligation to pay down the debt or provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which may adversely affect our cash flows. The obligation to provide collateral is limited to these subsidiaries and is non-recourse to Aimco. At December 31, 2009, these subsidiaries were not required to provide cash collateral based on the loan-to-value ratios of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements.
We periodically evaluate counterparty credit risk associated with these arrangements. At the current time, we have concluded we do not have material exposure. In the event a counterparty were to default under these arrangements, loss of the net interest benefit we generally receive under these arrangements, which is equal to the difference between the fixed rate we receive and the variable rate we pay, may adversely affect our operating cash flows.
See in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of these arrangements, including the current swap maturity dates.
Derivative Financial Instruments
As of December 31, 2009, the amount available under our $180.0 million revolving credit facility was $136.2 million (after giving effect to $43.8 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit). Our total outstanding term loan of $90.0 million at December 31, 2009, matures in March 2011. We repaid an additional $45.0 million on the term loan through February 26, 2010, leaving a remaining outstanding balance of $45.0 million. Additionally, we have limited obligations to fund redevelopment commitments during the year ending December 31, 2010, and no development commitments.
At December 31, 2009, we had $81.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $218.4 million from December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, we had $219.0 million of restricted cash, primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital additions, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8.
Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash provided by operating activities of $233.8 million was primarily related to operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties, in excess of payments of operating accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including amounts related to our organizational restructuring. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $206.6 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to a $159.3 million decrease in operating income related to consolidated properties included in discontinued operations, which was attributable to property sales in 2009 and 2008, a $42.8 million decrease in promote income, which is generated by the disposition of properties by consolidated real estate partnerships, and an increase in payments on operating accounts payable and accrued expenses, including payments related to our restructuring accrual, in 2009 as compared to 2008.
 
Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2009, our net cash provided by investing activities of $630.3 million consisted primarily of proceeds from disposition of real estate and partnership interests, partially offset by capital expenditures.
Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 89 consolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $1.3 billion, or $1.2 billion, after the payment of transaction costs and debt prepayment penalties. The $1.2 billion is inclusive of promote income and debt assumed by buyers. Net cash proceeds from property sales were used primarily to repay term debt and for other corporate purposes.
Capital Additions
We classify all capital additions as Capital Replacements (which we refer to as CR), Capital Improvements (which we refer to as CI), casualties or redevelopment. Additions other than casualty or redevelopment capital additions are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property.
CR represents the share of capital additions that are deemed to replace the portion of acquired capital assets that was consumed during the period we have owned the asset. CI represents the share of additions that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset as compared to its original purchase condition. CR and CI exclude capital additions for casualties and redevelopment. Casualty additions represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset. A portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss. Redevelopment additions represent additions that substantially upgrade the property.
The table below details our share of actual spending, on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, for CR, CI, casualties and redevelopment for the year ended December 31, 2009, on a per unit and total dollar basis (in thousands, except per unit amounts). Per unit numbers for CR and CI are based on approximately 97,196 average units for the year, including 81,135 conventional units and 16,061 affordable units. Average units are weighted for the portion of the period that we owned an interest in the property, represent ownership-adjusted effective units, and exclude non-managed units.
 
Included in the above additions for CI, casualties and redevelopment, was approximately $34.6 million of our share of capitalized site payroll and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended December 31, 2009.
We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities, working capital and property sales as discussed below.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion was primarily attributed to debt principal payments, dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from property loans.
Property Debt
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $5.6 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, in consolidated property debt outstanding, which included $178.3 million and $909.4 million, respectively, of property debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we refinanced or closed property loans on 55 properties generating $788.1 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.78%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $132.3 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance property debt primarily as a means of extending current and near term maturities and to finance certain capital projects.
Term Loans and Credit Facility
We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2009, the Credit Agreement consisted of aggregate commitments of $270.0 million, comprised of our $90.0 million outstanding balance on the term loan and $180.0 million of revolving loan commitments. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, or at our option, a base rate equal to the prime rate, and matures March 2011. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (either at LIBOR plus 4.25% with a LIBOR floor of 2.00% or, at our option, a base rate equal to the Prime rate plus a spread of 3.00%). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2011, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 45.0 basis point fee on the total revolving commitments and repayment of the remaining term loan balance by February 1, 2011.
At December 31, 2009, the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of $90.0 million and an interest rate of 1.73%. We repaid $45.0 million on the term loan through February 26, 2010, leaving a remaining outstanding balance of $45.0 million. At December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2009, was $136.2 million (after giving effect to $43.8 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes.
Fair Value Measurements
We have entered into total rate of return swaps on various fixed rate secured tax-exempt bonds payable and fixed rate notes payable to convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower our cost of borrowing. We designate total rate of return swaps as hedges of the risk of overall changes in the fair value of the underlying borrowings. At each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of these borrowings and the total rate of return swaps and recognize any changes therein as an adjustment of interest expense.
 
Our method used to calculate the fair value of the total rate of return swaps generally results in changes in fair value that are equal to the changes in fair value of the related borrowings, which is consistent with our hedging strategy. We believe that these financial instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value of the related borrowings during the hedging period, and accordingly, changes in the fair value of these instruments have no material impact on our liquidity, results of operations or capital resources.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, changes in the fair values of these financial instruments resulted in increases of $5.2 million in the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings and equal decreases in accrued liabilities and other for total rate of return swaps. At December 31, 2009, the cumulative recognized changes in the fair value of these financial instruments resulted in a $24.3 million reduction in the carrying amount of the hedged borrowings offset by an equal increase in accrued liabilities and other for total rate of return swaps. The cumulative changes in the fair values of the hedged borrowings and related swaps reflect the recent uncertainty in the credit markets which has decreased demand and increased pricing for similar debt instruments.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we received net cash receipts of $19.4 million under the total return swaps, which positively affected our liquidity. To the extent interest rates increase above the fixed rates on the underlying borrowings, our obligations under the total return swaps will negatively affect our liquidity. At December 31, 2009, we were not required to provide cash collateral pursuant to the total rate of return swaps. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline, we may be required to provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which would adversely affect our liquidity.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information on our total rate of return swaps and related borrowings.
Equity Transactions
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid cash dividends or distributions totaling $52.2 million, $95.3 million and $28.5 million to preferred stockholders, common stockholders and noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, respectively. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $149.0 million to common stockholders through the issuance of approximately 15.5 million shares. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid distributions of $91.9 million to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 12 shares, or $6.0 million in liquidation preference, of CRA Preferred Stock for $4.2 million.
We and the Aimco Operating Partnership have a shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership.
Contractual Obligations
This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2009 (amounts in thousands):
 
In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, at December 31, 2009, we had $690.5 million of outstanding preferred stock outstanding with annual dividend yields ranging from 1.5% (variable) to 9.4%, and $85.7 million of preferred units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding with annual distribution yields ranging from 5.9% to 9.5%.
Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
Future Capital Needs
In addition to the items set forth in "Contractual Obligations" above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, additional redevelopment projects, capital improvements and capital replacement principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax-free exchange proceeds), short-term borrowings, debt and equity financing (including tax credit equity) and operating cash flows.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests typically range from less than 1% to 50% and in some instances may exceed 50%. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships).

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
All other schedules are omitted because they are not applicable or the required information is shown in the financial statements or notes thereto.
 
Stockholders and Board of Directors Apartment Investment and Management Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying Index to Financial Statements. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.
The consolidated financial statements include retroactive adjustments to reflect the adoption in 2009 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment to ARB 51 (codified in FASB ASC 810), Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations  a replacement of FASB Statement No 141 (codified in FASB ASC 805), FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities (codified in FASB ASC 260), and FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-01, Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash (codified in FASB ASC 505). Further, as discussed in Notes 13 and 17, the Company retrospectively adjusted the consolidated financial statements to reflect real estate assets that meet the definition of a component and have been sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2009 pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (codified in FASB ASC 360), through September 30, 2010, and to reflect changes in its reportable segments. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008 has been restated to reclassify provisions for impairment losses on real estate development assets into operating income.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 (which is not included herein) expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Denver, Colorado February 26, 2010, except for Note 17, as to which the date is September 10, 2010, and Note 13, as to which the date is November 19, 2010
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE 1  Organization
Apartment Investment and Management Company, or Aimco, is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January 10, 1994. We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and redevelopment of apartment properties. As of December 31, 2009, we owned or managed a real estate portfolio of 870 apartment properties containing 135,654 apartment units located in 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We are one of the largest owners and operators of apartment properties in the United States.
As of December 31, 2009, we:
Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP, Inc. and AIMCO-LP Trust, we own a majority of the ownership interests in AIMCO Properties, L.P., which we refer to as the Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2009, we held an interest of approximately 93% in the common partnership units and equivalents of the Aimco Operating Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business and own substantially all of our assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are referred to as "OP Units." OP Units include common OP Units, partnership preferred units, or preferred OP Units, and high performance partnership units, or High Performance Units. The Aimco Operating Partnership's income is allocated to holders of common OP Units based on the weighted average number of common OP Units outstanding during the period. The Aimco Operating Partnership records the issuance of common OP Units and the assets acquired in purchase transactions based on the market price of Aimco Class A Common Stock (which we refer to as Common Stock) at the date of closing of the transaction. The holders of the common OP Units and Class I High Performance Units receive distributions, prorated from the date of issuance, in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Stock. Holders of common OP Units may redeem such units for cash or, at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option, Common Stock. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the weighted average ownership interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership held by the common OP Unit holders was approximately 7%, 10% and 9%, respectively. Preferred OP Units entitle the holders thereof to a preference with respect to distributions or upon liquidation. At December 31, 2009, 116,479,791 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding and the Aimco Operating Partnership had 8,374,233 common OP Units and equivalents outstanding for a combined total of 124,854,024 shares of Common Stock and OP Units outstanding (excluding preferred OP Units).
Except as the context otherwise requires, "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and their consolidated entities, collectively.
NOTE 2  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities. We consolidate all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate real estate partnerships and other entities that are not variable interest entities when we own, directly or indirectly, a majority voting interest in the entity or are otherwise able to control the entity. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in partnerships consolidated into the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by third parties are reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. The assets of consolidated real estate partnerships owned or controlled by us generally are not available to pay creditors of Aimco or the Aimco Operating Partnership.
As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "partnership" refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and "partner" refers to a partner in a limited partnership or a member in a limited liability company.
Variable Interest Entities
We consolidate all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, a variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. The primary beneficiary generally is the entity that will receive a majority of the VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's expected residual returns, or both.
In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: the amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; our and the other investors' ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the VIE; and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions.
As of December 31, 2009, we were the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidated, 90 VIEs, which owned 67 apartment properties with 9,652 units. Real estate with a carrying amount of $769.4 million collateralized $474.3 million of debt of those VIEs. The creditors of the consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to our general credit. As of December 31, 2009, we also held variable interests in 120 VIEs for which we were not the primary beneficiary. Those VIEs consist primarily of partnerships that are engaged, directly or indirectly, in the ownership and management of 172 apartment properties with 9,566 units. We are involved with those VIEs as an equity holder, lender, management agent, or through other contractual relationships. At December 31, 2009, our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with unconsolidated VIEs is limited to our recorded investments in and receivables from those VIEs totaling $107.5 million and our contractual obligation to advance funds to certain VIEs totaling $4.6 million. We may be subject to additional losses to the extent of any financial support that we voluntarily provide in the future. Additionally, the provision of financial support in the future may require us to consolidate a VIE.
In December 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2009-17, or ASU 2009-17, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. ASU 2009-17, which modifies the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 810, introduces a more qualitative approach to evaluating VIEs for consolidation and requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity that has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's performance, ASU 2009-17 requires a company to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed, requires continuous reassessment of primary beneficiary status rather than periodic, event-driven assessments as previously required, and incorporates expanded disclosure requirements.
Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities,
 
Our adoption of ASU 2009-17 during 2010 may result in changes in our conclusions regarding whether we are required to consolidate certain unconsolidated real estate partnerships that are VIEs. As of December 31, 2009, in addition to the unconsolidated VIEs discussed above, we held insignificant partnership interests in VIEs that own approximately 250 properties. We hold general and/or limited partner interests generally ranging from less than 1% to 5% and our recorded investment in these entities is typically limited to accounts receivable from our provision of property management and asset management services to these partnerships. We may be required to consolidate some of these VIEs if we conclude that we control the activities that are significant to the VIEs' economic performance. Additionally, we may be required to deconsolidate certain VIEs that we currently consolidate if we conclude we do not control the activities that are significant to such VIEs' economic performance. We have not yet completed our evaluation of ASU 2009-17 and therefore have not determined the effect our adoption of ASU 2009-17 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition of Real Estate Assets and Related Depreciation and Amortization
We capitalize the purchase price and incremental direct costs associated with the acquisition of properties as the cost of the assets acquired. We allocate the cost of acquired properties to tangible assets and identified intangible assets based on their fair values. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, on an "as-if vacant" basis, generally using internal valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, discounted cash flow techniques, replacement costs and other available information. We determine the fair value of identified intangible assets (or liabilities), which typically relate to in-place leases, using internal valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases, and our experience in leasing similar properties. The intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of:
The values of the above- and below-market leases are amortized to rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases. Other intangible assets related to in-place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases. Amortization is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any early lease terminations that were not anticipated in determining amortization periods.
Depreciation for all tangible real estate assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Acquired buildings and improvements are depreciated over a composite life of 14 to 52 years, based on the age, condition and other physical characteristics of the property. As discussed under below, we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or demolished prior to the end of their useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment associated with acquired properties are depreciated over five years.
Impairment of Long Lived Assets
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, deferred income in our consolidated balance sheets includes below-market lease amounts totaling $31.8 million and $36.2 million, respectively, which are net of accumulated amortization of $21.0 million and $16.6 million, respectively. Additions to below-market leases resulting from acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $18.9 million, and there were no such additions during the years ended December 31, 2009 or 2008. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we included amortization of below-market leases of $4.4 million, $4.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in rental and other property revenues in our consolidated statements of income. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we revised the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions completed in 2007, resulting in a $4.7 million reduction of below-market lease values and a corresponding reduction in buildings and improvements. At December 31, 2009, our below-market leases had a weighted average amortization period of 7.1 years and estimated aggregate amortization for each of the five succeeding years as follows (in millions):
 
Capital Additions and Related Depreciation
We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the property level. We characterize as "indirect costs" an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses.
We depreciate capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related component or improvement, which is generally five, 15 or 30 years. All capitalized site payroll and indirect costs are allocated proportionately, based on direct costs, among capital projects and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of such projects.
Certain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as carpeting and appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of property casualties, where the net book value of lost property is written off in the determination of casualty gains or losses, we generally do not recognize any loss in connection with the replacement of an existing property component because normal replacements are considered in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $9.8 million, $25.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively, of interest costs, and $40.0 million, $78.1 million and $78.1 million, respectively, of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Our real estate and other long-lived assets classified as held for use are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amounts are not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in our Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the declines in land values in Southern California during 2008 and the expected timing of our redevelopment efforts, we determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, recognized an impairment loss of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax).
Similarly, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the three months ended December 31, 2008.
In addition to the impairments of Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas, based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2007, we recorded real estate impairment losses of $2.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded no similar impairment losses related to properties classified as held for use.
We report impairment losses or recoveries related to properties sold or classified as held for sale in discontinued operations.
Our tests of recoverability address real estate assets that do not currently meet all conditions to be classified as held for sale, but are expected to be disposed of prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. If an impairment loss is not required to be recorded, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We also may adjust depreciation prospectively to reduce to zero the carrying amount of buildings that we plan to demolish in connection with a redevelopment project. These depreciation adjustments, after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, decreased net income available to Aimco common stockholders by $18.3 million, $10.7 million and $33.8 million, and resulted in decreases in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.16, $0.12 and $0.35, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
Cash Equivalents
We classify highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes capital replacement reserves, completion repair reserves, bond sinking fund amounts and tax and insurance escrow accounts held by lenders.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are generally comprised of amounts receivable from residents, amounts receivable from non-affiliated real estate partnerships for which we provide property management and other services and other miscellaneous receivables from non-affiliated entities. We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable from residents and establish an allowance, after the application of security deposits and other anticipated recoveries, for accounts greater than 30 days past due for current residents and all receivables due from former residents. Accounts receivable from residents are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.4 million and $3.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable from non-affiliated entities and establish an allowance for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable relating to non-affiliated entities are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $5.4 million and $5.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from Affiliates
Accounts receivable from affiliates are generally comprised of receivables related to property management and other services provided to unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which we have an ownership interest. We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable balances from affiliates on a periodic basis, and establish an allowance for the amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable from affiliates are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.9 million and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Deferred Costs
We defer lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining new financing and amortize the amounts over the terms of the related loan agreements. Amortization of these costs is included in interest expense.
We defer leasing commissions and other direct costs incurred in connection with successful leasing efforts and amortize the costs over the terms of the related leases. Amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization.
Notes Receivable from Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships and Non-Affiliates and Related Interest Income and Provision for Losses
Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner but do not consolidate the partnership. The ultimate repayment of these notes and those from non-affiliates is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders. Our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as "par value notes," and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as "discounted notes."
We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income.
 
We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has closed or entered into certain pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method.
We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate. See Note 5 for further discussion of Notes Receivable.
Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
We own general and limited partner interests in real estate partnerships that own apartment properties. We generally account for investments in real estate partnerships that we do not consolidate under the equity method. Under the equity method, our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented is included in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated real estate partnerships, except for our share of impairments and property disposition gains related to such entities, which we report separately in the consolidated statements of income. Certain investments in real estate partnerships that were acquired in business combinations were determined to have insignificant value at the acquisition date and are accounted for under the cost method. Any distributions received from such partnerships are recognized as income when received.
The excess of the cost of the acquired partnership interests over the historical carrying amount of partners' equity or deficit is ascribed generally to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the partnerships. We amortize the excess cost related to the buildings over the estimated useful lives of the buildings. Such amortization is recorded as a component of equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
Intangible Assets
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, other assets included goodwill associated with our real estate segment of $71.8 million and $81.9 million, respectively. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill that compares the fair value of reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. We determined that our goodwill was not impaired in 2009, 2008 or 2007.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we allocated $10.1 million of goodwill related to our real estate segment to the carrying amounts of the properties sold or classified as held for sale. The amounts of goodwill allocated to these properties were based on the relative fair values of the properties sold or classified as held for sale and the retained portions of the reporting units to which the goodwill as allocated. During 2008 and 2007, we did not allocate any goodwill to properties sold or classified as held for sale as real estate properties were not considered businesses under then applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP.
Other assets also includes intangible assets for purchased management contracts with finite lives that we amortize on a straight-line basis over terms ranging from five to 20 years and intangible assets for in-place leases as discussed under
Acquisition of Real Estate Assets and Related Depreciation and Amortization.
Capitalized Software Costs
Purchased software and other costs related to software developed for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally five years. We write-off the costs of software development projects when it is no longer probable that the software will be completed and placed in service. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we capitalized software development costs totaling $5.6 million, $20.9 million and $11.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, other assets included $29.7 million and $35.7 million of net capitalized software, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized amortization of capitalized software of $11.5 million, $10.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we reassessed our approach to communication technology needs at our properties, which resulted in the discontinuation of an infrastructure project and a $5.4 million write-off of related hardware and capitalized internal and consulting costs included in other assets. The write-off, which is net of sales proceeds, is included in other expenses, net. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we additionally recorded a $1.6 million write-off of certain software and hardware assets that are no longer consistent with our information technology strategy. This write-off is included in depreciation and amortization. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we abandoned certain internal-use software development projects and recorded a $4.2 million write-off of the capitalized costs of such projects in depreciation and amortization. There were no similar write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2009.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
We report the unaffiliated partners' interests in our consolidated real estate partnerships as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships represent the noncontrolling partners' share of the underlying net assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships. Prior to 2009, when these consolidated real estate partnerships made cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest, we generally recorded a charge equal to the amount of such excess distribution, even though there was no economic effect or cost. These charges are reported in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 within noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Also prior to 2009, we allocated the noncontrolling partners' share of partnership losses to noncontrolling partners to the extent of the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest. We generally recorded a charge when the noncontrolling partners' share of partnership losses exceed the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest, even though there is no economic effect or cost. These charges are reported in the consolidated statements of income within noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. We did not record charges for distributions or losses in certain limited instances where the noncontrolling partner had a legal obligation and financial capacity to contribute additional capital to the partnership. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges for partnership losses resulting from depreciation of approximately $9.0 million and $12.2 million, respectively that were not allocated to noncontrolling partners because the losses exceeded the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest.
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of equity interests held by limited partners in consolidated real estate partnerships that have finite lives. The terms of the related partnership agreements generally require the partnership to be liquidated following the sale of the partnership's real estate. As the general partner in these partnerships, we ordinarily control the execution of real estate sales and other events that could lead to the liquidation, redemption or other settlement of noncontrolling interests. The aggregate carrying amount of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships is approximately $316.2 million at December 31, 2009. The aggregate fair value of these interests varies based on the fair value of the real estate owned by the partnerships. Based on the number of classes of finite-life noncontrolling interests, the number of properties in which there is direct or indirect noncontrolling ownership, complexities in determining the allocation of liquidation proceeds among partners and other factors, we believe it is impracticable to determine the total required payments to the noncontrolling interests in an assumed liquidation at December 31, 2009. As a result of real estate depreciation that is recognized in our financial statements and appreciation in the fair value of real estate that is not recognized in our financial statements, we believe that the aggregate fair value of our noncontrolling interests exceeds their aggregate carrying amount. As a result of our ability to control real estate sales and other events that require payment of noncontrolling interests and our expectation that proceeds from real estate sales will be sufficient to liquidate related noncontrolling interests, we anticipate that the eventual liquidation of these noncontrolling interests will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
Revenue Recognition
Our properties have operating leases with apartment residents with terms generally of 12 months or less. We recognize rental revenue related to these leases, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We recognize revenues from property management, asset management, syndication and other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable.
 
Advertising Costs
We generally expense all advertising costs as incurred to property operating expense. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, for both continuing and discontinued operations, total advertising expense was $25.0 million, $36.0 million and $38.0 million, respectively.
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverages insure our properties adequately against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils. In addition, we have insurance coverage for substantial portions of our property, workers' compensation, health, and general liability exposures. Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize all stock-based employee compensation, including grants of employee stock options, in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value and recognize compensation cost, which is net of estimates for expected forfeitures, ratably over the awards' requisite service period. See Note 12 for further discussion of our stock-based compensation.
Tax Credit Arrangements
We sponsor certain partnerships that own and operate apartment properties that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, and for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, subsidized rents under HUD's Section 8 program. These partnerships acquire, develop and operate qualifying affordable housing properties and are structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and deductions to their partners. The tax credits are generally realized ratably over the first ten years of the tax credit arrangement and are subject to the partnership's compliance with applicable laws and regulations for a period of 15 years. Typically, we are the general partner with a legal ownership interest of one percent or less. We market limited partner interests of at least 99 percent to unaffiliated institutional investors (which we refer to as tax credit investors or investors) and receive a syndication fee from each investor upon such investor's admission to the partnership. At inception, each investor agrees to fund capital contributions to the partnerships. We agree to perform various services to the partnerships in exchange for fees over the expected duration of the tax credit service period. The related partnership agreements generally require adjustment of each tax credit investor's required capital contributions if actual tax benefits to such investor differ from projected amounts.
We have determined that the partnerships in these arrangements are variable interest entities and, where we are general partner, we are generally the primary beneficiary that is required to consolidate the partnerships. When the contractual arrangements obligate us to deliver tax benefits to the investors, and entitle us through fee arrangements to receive substantially all available cash flow from the partnerships, we account for these partnerships as wholly owned subsidiaries. Capital contributions received by the partnerships from tax credit investors represent, in substance, consideration that we receive in exchange for our obligation to deliver tax credits and other tax benefits to the investors, and the receipts are recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements when our obligation to the investors is relieved upon delivery of the expected tax benefits.
In summary, our accounting treatment recognizes the income or loss generated by the underlying real estate based on our economic interest in the partnerships. Proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of the tax credits are recognized as revenue proportionately as the tax benefits are delivered to the tax credit investors and our obligation is relieved. Syndication fees and related costs are recognized in income upon completion of the syndication effort. We recognize syndication fees in amounts determined based on a market rate analysis of fees for comparable services, which generally fell within a range of 10% to 15% of investor contributions during the periods presented. Other direct and incremental costs incurred in structuring these arrangements are deferred and amortized over the expected duration of the arrangement in proportion to the recognition of related income. Investor contributions in excess of recognized revenue are reported as deferred income in our consolidated balance sheets.
During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recognized syndication fee income of $3.4 million and $13.8 million, respectively. We recognized no syndication fee income during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 we recognized revenue associated with the delivery of tax benefits of $36.6 million, $29.4 million and $24.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $148.1 million and $159.6 million, respectively, of investor contributions in excess of the recognized revenue were included in deferred income in our consolidated balance sheets.
 
Discontinued Operations
We classify certain properties and related assets and liabilities as held for sale when they meet certain criteria. The operating results of such properties as well as those properties sold during the periods presented are included in discontinued operations in both current periods and all comparable periods presented. Depreciation is not recorded on properties once they have been classified as held for sale; however, depreciation expense recorded prior to classification as held for sale is included in discontinued operations. The net gain on sale and any impairment losses are presented in discontinued operations when recognized. See Note 13 for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We primarily use long-term, fixed-rate and self-amortizing non-recourse debt to avoid, among other things, risk related to fluctuating interest rates. For our variable rate debt, we are sometimes required by our lenders to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering into interest rate swap or cap agreements. The interest rate swap agreements moderate our exposure to interest rate risk by effectively converting the interest on variable rate debt to a fixed rate. The interest rate cap agreements effectively limit our exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, and periodic changes in fair value are included in interest expense or equity, as appropriate. These interest rate caps are not material to our financial position or results of operations.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of $52.3 million and $27.2 million, and recorded fair values of $1.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, reflected in accrued liabilities and other in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2009, these interest rate swaps had a weighted average term of 11.1 years. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and recognize any changes in their fair value as an adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive income within equity to the extent of their effectiveness. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized changes in fair value of $1.0 million, of which $1.4 million resulted in an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss within consolidated equity. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized changes in fair value of $2.2 million, of which $2.1 million resulted in an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss within consolidated equity. We recognized $0.4 million and less than $0.1 million of ineffectiveness as an adjustment of interest expense during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and we recognized no ineffectiveness during the year ended December 31, 2007. Our consolidated comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $43.4 million and our comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, totaled $624.9 million and $124.8 million, respectively, before the effects of noncontrolling interests. If the forward rates at December 31, 2009 remain constant, we estimate that during the next twelve months, we would reclassify into earnings approximately $1.5 million of the unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.
We have entered into total rate of return swaps on various fixed rate secured tax-exempt bonds payable and fixed rate notes payable to convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower our cost of borrowing. In exchange for our receipt of a fixed rate generally equal to the underlying borrowing's interest rate, the total rate of return swaps require that we pay a variable rate, equivalent to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index, or SIFMA, rate for tax-exempt bonds payable and the 30-day LIBOR rate for notes payable, plus a risk spread. These swaps generally have a second or third lien on the property collateralized by the related borrowings and the obligations under certain of these swaps are cross-collateralized with certain of the other swaps with a particular counterparty. The underlying borrowings are generally callable at our option, with no prepayment penalty, with 30 days advance notice, and the swaps generally have a term of less than five years. The total rate of return swaps have a contractually defined termination value generally equal to the difference between the fair value and the counterparty's purchased value of the underlying borrowings, which may require payment by us or to us for such difference. Accordingly, we believe fluctuations in the fair value of the borrowings from the inception of the hedging relationship generally will be offset by a corresponding fluctuation in the fair value of the total rate of return swaps.
We designate total rate of return swaps as hedges of the risk of overall changes in the fair value of the underlying borrowings. At each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of these borrowings and the total rate of return swaps and recognize any changes therein as an adjustment of interest expense. We evaluate the effectiveness of these fair value hedges at the end of each reporting period and recognize an adjustment of interest expense as a result of any ineffectiveness.
 
Borrowings payable subject to total rate of return swaps with aggregate outstanding principal balances of $352.7 million and $421.7 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, are reflected as variable rate borrowings in Note 6. Due to changes in the estimated fair values of these debt instruments and the corresponding total rate of return swaps, we increased property loans payable by $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and reduced property loans payable by $20.1 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, with offsetting adjustments to accrued liabilities, resulting in no net effect on net income. Refer to for further discussion of fair value measurements related to these arrangements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we determined these hedges were fully effective and accordingly we made no adjustments to interest expense for ineffectiveness.
Fair Value Measurements
At December 31, 2009, the weighted average fixed receive rate under the total return swaps was 6.8% and the weighted average variable pay rate was 1.0%, based on the applicable SIFMA and 30-day LIBOR rates effective as of that date. Further information related to our total return swaps as of December 31, 2009 is as follows (dollars in millions):
Fair Value Measurements
Beginning in 2008, we applied the FASB's revised accounting provisions related to fair value measurements, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 820. These revised provisions define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, establish a hierarchy that prioritizes the information used in developing fair value estimates and require disclosure of fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3 measurements), such as the reporting entity's own data. We adopted the revised fair value measurement provisions that apply to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2008, and the provisions that apply to the remaining fair value measurements effective January 1, 2009, and at those times determined no transition adjustments were required.
The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and includes three levels defined as follows:
A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used for our significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Although some of the valuation methodologies use observable market inputs in limited instances, the majority of inputs we use are unobservable and are therefore classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
Provisions for Real Estate Impairment Losses
If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property, for properties classified as held for use, and estimated fair value of the property, less estimated selling costs, for properties classified as held for sale.
We estimate the fair value of real estate using income and market valuation techniques using information such as broker estimates, purchase prices for recent transactions on comparable assets and net operating income capitalization analyses using observable and unobservable inputs such as capitalization rates, asset quality grading, geographic location analysis, and local supply and demand observations. For certain properties classified as held for sale, we may also recognize the impairment loss based on the contract sale price, which we believe is representative of fair value, less estimated selling costs.
Notes Receivable
We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the real estate, which represents the primary source of loan repayment. The fair value of real estate is estimated through income and market valuation approaches using information such as broker estimates, purchase prices for recent transactions on comparable assets and net operating income capitalization analyses using observable and unobservable inputs such as capitalization rates, asset quality grading, geographic location analysis, and local supply and demand observations.
Interest Rate Swaps
We estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps using an income approach with primarily observable inputs, including information regarding the hedged variable cash flows and forward yield curves relating to the variable interest rates on which the hedged cash flows are based.
Total Rate of Return Swaps
Our total rate of return swaps have contractually-defined termination values generally equal to the difference between the fair value and the counterparty's purchased value of the underlying borrowings. Upon termination, we are required to pay the counterparty the difference if the fair value is less than the purchased value, and the counterparty is required to pay us the difference if the fair value is greater than the purchased value. The underlying borrowings are generally callable, at our option, at face value prior to maturity and with no prepayment penalty. Due to our control of the call features in the underlying borrowings, we believe the inherent value of any differential between the fixed and variable cash payments due under the swaps would be significantly discounted by a market participant willing to purchase or assume any rights and obligations under these contracts.
The swaps are generally cross-collateralized with other swap contracts with the same counterparty and do not allow transfer or assignment, thus there is no alternate or secondary market for these instruments. Accordingly, our assumptions about the fair value that a willing market participant would assign in valuing these instruments are based on a hypothetical market in which the highest and best use of these contracts is in-use in combination with the related borrowings, similar to how we use the contracts. Based on these assumptions, we believe the termination value, or exit value, of the swaps approximates the fair value that would be assigned by a willing market participant. We calculate the termination value using a market approach by reference to estimates of the fair value of the underlying borrowings, which are discussed below, and an evaluation of potential changes in the credit quality of the counterparties to these arrangements. We compare our estimates of the fair value of the swaps and related borrowings to the valuations provided by the counterparties on a quarterly basis.
 
Our method for calculating fair value of the swaps generally results in changes in fair value equal to the changes in fair value of the related borrowings. Accordingly, we believe these instruments are highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value of the borrowings during the hedging period.
Changes in Fair Value of Borrowings Subject to Total Rate of Return Swaps
We recognize changes in the fair value of certain borrowings subject to total rate of return swaps, which we have designated as fair value hedges.
We estimate the fair value of debt instruments using an income and market approach, including comparison of the contractual terms to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, collateral quality and loan-to-value ratios on similarly encumbered assets within our portfolio. These borrowings are collateralized and non-recourse to us; therefore, we believe changes in our credit rating will not materially affect a market participant's estimate of the borrowings' fair value.
The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
The table below presents amounts at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (and the changes in fair value between such dates) for significant items measured in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (in thousands). Certain of these fair value measurements are based on significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. When a determination is made to classify a fair value measurement within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 fair value measurements typically include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components that can be validated to observable external sources; accordingly, the changes in fair value in the table below are due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.
 
In addition to the amounts in the table above, during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized $56.9 million, $118.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of provisions for real estate impairment losses (including amounts in discontinued operations) to reduce the carrying amounts of certain real estate properties to their estimated fair value (or fair value less estimated costs to sell) and provisions for losses on notes receivable of $21.5 million, $17.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively, based on our estimates of the fair value of the real estate properties that represent the primary source of repayment. Based on the significance of the unobservable inputs used in our methods for estimating the fair values for these amounts, we classify these fair value measurements within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
Disclosures Regarding Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We believe that the aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short-term secured debt approximates their aggregate carrying value at December 31, 2009, due to their relatively short-term nature and high probability of realization. We estimate fair value for our notes receivable and debt instruments using present value techniques that include income and market valuation approaches using observable inputs such as market rates for debt with the same or similar terms and unobservable inputs such as collateral quality and loan-to-value ratios on similarly encumbered assets. Present value calculations vary depending on the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In many cases, the fair value estimates may not be realizable in immediate settlement of the instruments. The estimated aggregate fair value of our notes receivable was approximately $126.1 million and $161.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 5 for further information on notes receivable. The estimated aggregate fair value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.7 billion and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The combined carrying amount of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.7 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 6 and Note 7 for further details on our consolidated debt. Refer to for further discussion regarding certain of our fixed rate debt that is subject to total rate of return swap instruments.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Income Taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. Our current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Code, which are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to United States Federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.
Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to United States Federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on our undistributed income. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arms length transactions between us and a TRS (described below) and on any net income from sales of property that was property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course. We and our stockholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or our stockholders reside. In addition, we could also be subject to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, on our items of tax preference. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the United States Federal income tax treatment. Any taxes imposed on us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.
Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, including property management, asset management and risk, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are subsidiaries of the Aimco Operating Partnership, and each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and as such is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents, as these services and activities generally cannot be offered directly by the REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties.
 
For our TRS entities, deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for Federal income tax purposes, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We reduce deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance when we determine based on available evidence that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. We recognize the tax consequences associated with intercompany transfers between the REIT and TRS entities when the related assets are sold to third parties, impaired or otherwise disposed of for financial reporting purposes.
In March 2008, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that it intended to examine the 2006 Federal tax return for the Aimco Operating Partnership. During June 2008, the IRS issued AIMCO-GP, Inc., the general and tax matters partner of the Aimco Operating Partnership, a summary report including the IRS's proposed adjustments to the Aimco Operating Partnership's 2006 Federal tax return. In addition, in May 2009, we were notified by the IRS that it intended to examine the 2007 Federal tax return for the Aimco Operating Partnership. During November 2009, the IRS issued AIMCO-GP, Inc. a summary report including the IRS's proposed adjustments to the Aimco Operating Partnership's 2007 Federal tax return. We do not expect the 2006 or 2007 proposed adjustments to have any material effect on our unrecognized tax benefits, financial condition or results of operations.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially could subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of notes receivable and total rate of return swaps. As discussed in Note 5, a significant portion of our notes receivable at December 31, 2009, are collateralized by properties in the West Harlem area of New York City. There are no other significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to our notes receivable due to the large number of partnerships that are borrowers under the notes and the geographic diversity of the properties that collateralize the notes.
At December 31, 2009, we had total rate of return swap positions with two financial institutions totaling $353.1 million. The swap positions with one counterparty are comprised of $340.9 million of fixed rate debt effectively converted to variable rates using total rate of return swaps, including $295.7 million of tax-exempt bonds indexed to SIFMA and $45.2 million of taxable second mortgage notes indexed to LIBOR. Additionally, the swap agreements with this counterparty provide for collateral calls to maintain specified loan-to-value ratios. As of December 31, 2009, we were not required to provide cash collateral pursuant to the total rate of return swaps. We have one swap position with another counterparty that is comprised of $12.2 million of fixed rate tax-exempt bonds indexed to SIFMA. We periodically evaluate counterparty credit risk associated with these arrangements. At the current time, we have concluded we do not have material exposure. In the event either counterparty were to default under these arrangements, loss of the net interest benefit we generally receive under these arrangements, which is equal to the difference between the fixed rate we receive and the variable rate we pay, may adversely impact our results of operations and operating cash flows. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline, we may be required to provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which may adversely affect our cash flows.
FASB Accounting Standards Codification
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 168, or SFAS 168, which is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. Upon the effective date of SFAS 168, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the FASB ASC, became the single source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. The FASB ASC superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards, and all other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the FASB ASC is now non-authoritative. Subsequent to the effective date of SFAS 168, the FASB will issue Accounting Standards Updates that serve to update the FASB ASC.
The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162,
 
Business Combinations
We adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), , or SFAS 141(R), which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 805, effective January 1, 2009. These provisions apply to all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses, including those effected without the transfer of consideration, for example by contract or through a lapse of minority veto rights. These provisions require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establish the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and require expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs.
Business Combinations  a replacement of FASB Statement No. 141
We believe most operating real estate assets meet the revised definition of a business. Accordingly, beginning in 2009, we expense transaction costs associated with acquisitions of operating real estate or interests therein when we consolidate the asset. The FASB did not provide implementation guidance regarding the treatment of acquisition costs incurred prior to December 31, 2008, for acquisitions that did not close until 2009. The SEC indicated any of the following three transition methods were acceptable, provided that the method chosen is disclosed and applied consistently:
We elected to apply the third method and accordingly have retroactively adjusted our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, by $3.5 million, which also resulted in a corresponding reduction to our December 31, 2008 equity balance. This retroactive adjustment is reflected in investment management expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of income and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share amounts by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Noncontrolling Interests
Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, , or SFAS 160, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 810. These provisions clarified that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in a consolidated entity, which should be reported as equity in the parent's consolidated financial statements. These provisions require disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statements, of the amounts of consolidated net income and other comprehensive income attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests, eliminating the past practice of reporting amounts of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as an adjustment in arriving at consolidated net income. These provisions also require us to attribute to noncontrolling interests their share of losses even if such attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance within our equity accounts, and in some instances, recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51
In connection with our retrospective application of these provisions, we reclassified into our consolidated equity accounts the historical balances related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and the portion of noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership related to the Aimco Operating Partnership's common OP Units and High Performance Units. At December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships was $380.7 million and the carrying amount for noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership attributable to common OP Units and High Performance Units was zero, due to cash distributions in excess of the positive balances related to those noncontrolling interests.
Beginning in 2009, we no longer record a charge related to cash distributions to noncontrolling interests in excess of the carrying amount of such noncontrolling interests, and we attribute losses to noncontrolling interests even if such attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance within our equity accounts. The following table illustrates the pro forma amounts of loss from continuing operations, discontinued operations and net loss that would have been attributed to Aimco common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009, had we applied the accounting provisions related to noncontrolling interests prior to their amendment by SFAS 160 (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of preferred noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, which are generally redeemable at the holders' option and may be settled in cash or, at the Aimco Operating Partnership's discretion, shares of Common Stock and are included in temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheet, for the years ending December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.
The effects on our equity of changes in our ownership interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership are reflected in our consolidated statement of equity as redemptions of Aimco Operating Partnership units for Common Stock and repurchases of common partnership units.
Changes in our ownership interest in consolidated real estate partnerships generally consist of our purchase of an additional interest in or the sale of our entire interest in a consolidated real estate partnership. Our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships had no direct effect on equity attributable to Aimco during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, and did not have a significant effect on equity attributable to Aimco during the year ended December 31, 2009. The effect on our equity of sales of our entire interest in consolidated real estate partnerships is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as sales of real estate and accordingly the effect on our equity is reflected as gains on disposition of real estate, less the amounts of such gains attributable to noncontrolling interests, within consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Aimco common stockholders.
Earnings per Share
We calculate earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, common stock equivalents, participating securities and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period (see Note 14).
Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Position No. EITF 03-6-1, , or FSP EITF 03-6-1, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 260. FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarified that unvested share-based payment awards that participate in dividends similar to shares of common stock or common partnership units should be treated as participating securities. FSP EITF 03-6-1 affects our computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for unvested restricted stock awards and shares purchased pursuant to officer stock loans, which serve as collateral for such loans, both of which entitle the holders to dividends. Refer to Note 14, which details our calculation of earnings per share and the effect of our retroactive application of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on our earnings per share.
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities
 
In December 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-01, , or ASU 2010-01, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 505. ASU 2010-01 requires that for distributions with components of cash and stock, the portion distributed in stock should be accounted for prospectively as a stock issuance with no retroactive adjustment to basic and diluted earnings per share. In accordance with ASU 2010-01, we retrospectively revised the accounting treatment of our special dividends paid during 2008 and 2009, resulting in changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, as compared to the amounts previously reported.
Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash
The following table illustrates the effects of these changes in accounting treatment on our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding and on net income (loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders per common share for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Restatement to Reclassify Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets
Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2008, has been restated to reclassify the provision for impairment losses on real estate development assets into operating income. The reclassification reduced operating income by $91.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, and had no effect on the reported amounts of loss before income taxes and discontinued operations, loss from continuing operations, net income, net income available to Aimco common stockholders or earnings per share. Additionally, the reclassification had no effect on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008, or the consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Reclassifications
Certain items included in the 2008 and 2007 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
NOTE 3  Real Estate and Partnership Acquisitions and Other Significant Transactions
Real Estate Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not acquire any real estate properties.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we acquired three conventional properties with a total of 470 units, located in San Jose, California, Brighton, Massachusetts and Seattle, Washington. The aggregate purchase price of $111.5 million, excluding transaction costs, was funded using $39.0 million in proceeds from property loans, $41.9 million in tax-free exchange proceeds (provided by 2008 real estate dispositions) and the remainder in cash.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed the acquisition of 16 conventional properties with approximately 1,300 units for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $217.0 million, excluding transaction costs. Of the 16 properties acquired, ten are located in New York City, New York, two in Daytona Beach, Florida, one in Park Forest, Illinois, one in Poughkeepsie, New York, one in Redwood City, California, and one in North San Diego, California. The purchases were funded with cash, tax-free exchange proceeds, new debt and the assumption of existing debt.
Acquisitions of Partnership Interests
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we did not acquire a significant amount of limited partnership interests. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we acquired limited partnership interests in 22 and 50 partnerships, respectively, in which our affiliates served as general partner. In connection with such acquisitions, we paid cash of approximately $2.0 million and $47.4 million, including transaction costs. The cost of the acquisitions was approximately $2.4 million and $43.6 million in excess of the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest in such limited partnerships, which excess we generally assigned to real estate.
Disposition of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $22.5 million in gains on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other. Gains recognized in 2009 primarily consist of $8.6 million related to our receipt in 2009 of additional proceeds related to our disposition during 2008 of one of the partnership interests (discussed below), $4.0 million from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization (discussed further below), $6.1 million from our disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships and our share of gains recognized by our unconsolidated partnerships on the sale of real estate and $3.8 million related to various other transactions.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $99.9 million in gains on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other, which primarily consisted of a $98.4 million gain recognized on the disposal of our interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships that owned two properties with 671 units.
Casualty Loss Related to Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike
During 2008, Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike caused severe damage to certain of our properties located primarily in Florida and Texas, respectively. We incurred total losses of approximately $33.9 million, including property damage replacement costs and clean-up costs. After consideration of estimated third party insurance proceeds and the noncontrolling interest partners' share of losses for consolidated real estate partnerships, the net effect of these casualties on net income available to Aimco common stockholders was a loss of approximately $5.0 million.
Sale of Interest in Group Purchasing Organization
During 2009, we sold our interest in an unconsolidated group purchasing organization to an unrelated entity for $5.9 million, resulting in the recognition of a gain on sale of $4.0 million, which is included in gain on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2009. This gain was partially offset by a $1.0 million provision for income tax. We also have a note receivable from another principal in the group purchasing organization, which is collateralized by its equity interest in the entity. In connection with the sale of our interest, we reevaluated collectibility of the note receivable and reversed $1.4 million of previously recognized impairment losses, which is reflected in provision for losses on notes receivable, net in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the note receivable, which is due for repayment in 2010, totaled $1.6 million.
Restructuring Costs
In connection with 2008 property sales and an expected reduction in redevelopment and transactional activities, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we initiated an organizational restructuring program that included reductions in workforce and related costs, reductions in leased corporate facilities and abandonment of certain redevelopment projects and business pursuits. This restructuring effort resulted in a restructuring charge of $22.8 million, which consisted of: severance costs of $12.9 million; unrecoverable lease obligations of $6.4 million related to space that we will no longer use; and the write-off of deferred transaction costs totaling $3.5 million associated with certain acquisitions and redevelopment opportunities that we will no longer pursue. We completed the workforce reductions by March 31, 2009.
 
During 2009, in connection with continued repositioning of our portfolio, we completed additional organizational restructuring activities that included reductions in workforce and related costs and the abandonment of additional leased corporate facilities and redevelopment projects.
Our 2009 restructuring activities resulted in a restructuring charge of $11.2 million, which consisted of severance costs and personnel related costs of $7.0 million; unrecoverable lease obligations of $2.6 million related to space that we will no longer use; the write-off of deferred costs totaling $0.9 million associated with certain redevelopment opportunities that we will no longer pursue; and $0.7 million in other costs.
As of December 31, 2009, the remaining accruals associated with our restructuring activity are $6.9 million for estimated unrecoverable lease obligations, which will be paid over the remaining terms of the affected leases, and $4.7 million for severance and personnel related costs, which are anticipated to be paid during the first quarter 2010.
Transactions Involving VMS National Properties Joint Venture
In January 2007, VMS National Properties Joint Venture, or VMS, a consolidated real estate partnership in which we held a 22% equity interest, refinanced property loans secured by its 15 apartment properties. The existing loans had an aggregate carrying amount of $110.0 million and an aggregate face amount of $152.2 million. The $42.2 million difference between the face amount and carrying amount resulted from a 1997 bankruptcy settlement in which the lender agreed to reduce the principal amount of the loans subject to VMS's compliance with the terms of the restructured loans. Because the reduction in the loan amount was contingent on future compliance, recognition of the inherent debt extinguishment gain was deferred. Upon refinancing of the loans in January 2007, the existing lender accepted the reduced principal amount in full satisfaction of the loans, and VMS recognized the $42.2 million debt extinguishment gain in earnings.
During the year ended December 31, 2007, VMS sold eight properties to third parties for an aggregate gain of $22.7 million. Additionally, VMS contributed its seven remaining properties to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Aimco in exchange for consideration totaling $230.1 million, consisting primarily of cash of $21.3 million, common OP Units with a fair value of $9.8 million, the assumption of $168.0 million in property debt, and the assumption of $30.9 million in mortgage participation liabilities. This total consideration included $50.7 million related to our 22% equity interest in VMS. Exclusive of our share, the consideration paid for the seven properties exceeded the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest in such properties by $44.9 million. This excess consideration is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an increase in the carrying amount of the seven properties.
Approximately $32.7 million of the $42.2 million debt extinguishment gain related to the property loans that were secured by the eight properties sold to third parties and three properties we acquired from VMS but subsequently sold and is reported in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. The remaining $9.5 million portion of the debt extinguishment gain related to the property loans that were secured by the four VMS properties we purchased and continue to own and is reported in our continuing operations as gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other. Although 78% of the equity interests in VMS were held by unrelated noncontrolling partners, no noncontrolling interest share of the gains on debt extinguishment and sale of the properties was recognized in our earnings. As required by then applicable GAAP, we had in prior years recognized the noncontrolling partners' share of VMS losses in excess of the noncontrolling partners' capital contributions. The amounts of those previously recognized losses exceeded the noncontrolling partners' share of the gains on debt extinguishment and sale of the properties; accordingly, the noncontrolling interests in such gains recognized in our earnings was limited to the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the aggregate effect of the gains on extinguishment of VMS debt and sale of VMS properties was to decrease loss from continuing operations attributable to Aimco common stockholders by $8.7 million ($0.09 per diluted share) and decrease net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders by $59.1 million ($0.62 per diluted share).
During the three months ended December 31, 2007, VMS distributed its remaining cash, consisting primarily of undistributed proceeds from the sale of its 15 properties (including properties sold to us). Of the $42.4 million of cash distributed to the unrelated limited partners, $21.3 million represents the cash consideration we contributed in exchange for the purchase of seven properties and is presented in purchases of partnership interests and other assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007. The remainder of the cash distributed to the unrelated limited partners is presented in payment of distributions to noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
Palazzo Joint Venture
In December 2007, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a third party investor which provides for the co-ownership of three multi-family properties with 1,382 units located in West Los Angeles. Under the agreement, we contributed three wholly-owned properties, The Palazzo at Park La Brea, The Palazzo East at Park La Brea and The Villas at Park La Brea to the partnership, which we refer to as Palazzo, at a value of $726.0 million, or approximately $525,000 per unit. Palazzo had existing property debt of approximately $296.0 million and an implied equity value of approximately $430.0 million. We received $202.0 million from the investor in exchange for an approximate 47% interest in Palazzo, of which approximately $7.9 million was used to fund escrows for capital improvements and various operating requirements. We own the remaining interests in Palazzo, including a managing interest, and will operate the properties in exchange for a property management fee and certain other fees over the term of the partnership.
We determined Palazzo is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary who should consolidate this partnership. We deferred recognition of a gain on this transaction and recognized the consideration received as an increase in noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships.
NOTE 4  Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
We owned general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships owning approximately 77, 85 and 94 properties at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We acquired these interests through various transactions, including large portfolio acquisitions and offers to individual limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships typically ranges from less than 1% to 50% and in some instances may exceed 50%.
The following table provides selected combined financial information for the unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which we had investments accounted for under the equity method as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):
As a result of our acquisition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships at a cost in excess of the historical carrying amount of the partnerships' net assets, our aggregate investment in these partnerships at December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $105.3 million and $119.0 million, respectively, exceeds our share of the underlying historical partners' deficit of the partnerships by approximately $109.5 million and $122.9 million, respectively.
 
NOTE 5  Notes Receivable
The following table summarizes our notes receivable at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
Included in notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December 31, 2009 and 2008, are $2.4 million and $4.2 million, respectively, in notes that were secured by interests in real estate or interests in real estate partnerships. We earn interest on these secured notes receivable at various annual interest rates averaging 12.0%.
Included in the notes receivable from non-affiliates at December 31, 2009 and 2008, are $102.2 million and $95.8 million, respectively, in notes that were secured by interests in real estate or interests in real estate partnerships. We earn interest on these secured notes receivable at various annual interest rates ranging between 4.0% and 12.0% and averaging 4.7%.
Notes receivable from non-affiliates at December 31, 2009 and 2008, include notes receivable totaling $87.4 million and $85.6 million, respectively, from 31 entities (the "borrowers") that are wholly owned by a single individual. We originated these notes in November 2006 pursuant to a loan agreement that provides for total funding of approximately $110.0 million, including $16.4 million for property improvements and an interest reserve, of which $4.6 million had not been funded as of December 31, 2009. The notes mature in November 2016, bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.0%, are partially guaranteed by the owner of the borrowers, and are collateralized by second mortgages on 87 buildings containing 1,597 residential units and 42 commercial spaces in West Harlem, New York City. In conjunction with the loan agreement, we entered into a purchase option and put agreement with the borrowers under which we may purchase some or all of the buildings and, subject to achieving specified increases in rental income, the borrowers may require us to purchase the buildings (see Note 8). We determined that the stated interest rate on the notes on the date the loan was originated was a below-market interest rate and recorded a $19.4 million discount to reflect the estimated fair value of the notes based on an estimated market interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0%. The discount was determined to be attributable to our real estate purchase option, which we recorded separately in other assets. Accretion of this discount, which is included in interest income in our consolidated statements of income, totaled $0.9 million in 2009, $0.7 million in 2008 and $1.9 million in 2007, inclusive of a $1.5 million adjustment of accretion recognized upon the repayment of a portion of the outstanding principal balance in 2007. The value of the purchase option asset will be included in the cost of properties acquired pursuant to the option or otherwise be charged to expense. We determined that the borrowers are VIEs and, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis, determined that the individual who owns the borrowers and partially guarantees the notes is the primary beneficiary.
As part of the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc., we invested $50.0 million for a 20% passive interest in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to acquire, re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we account for this investment as a note receivable and through 2008 were amortizing the discounted value of the investment to the $50.0 million previously estimated to be collectible, through January 2, 2009, the initial dissolution date of the entity. In 2009, the managing member extended the dissolution date. In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements and as a result of a decline in land values in Southern California, we determined our recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2008. In connection with the preparation of our 2009 annual financial statements and as a result of continued declines in land values in Southern California, we determined our then recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2009.
 
Interest income from total non-impaired par value and certain discounted notes for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $5.7 million, $7.8 million and $11.7 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized accretion income on certain discounted notes of $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $8.1 million, respectively.
The activity in the allowance for loan losses in total for both par value notes and discounted notes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, is as follows (in thousands):
During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we determined that an allowance for loan losses of $1.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, was required on certain of our par value notes that had carrying amounts of $3.8 million and $11.4 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in the impaired par value notes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $7.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The remaining $28.4 million in par value notes receivable at December 31, 2009, is estimated to be collectible and, therefore, interest income on these par value notes is recognized as it is earned.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we determined that an allowance for loan losses of $1.0 million and $2.7 million, respectively, was required on certain of our discounted notes (excluding the note related to Casden Properties LLC discussed above) that had carrying values of $1.6 million and $5.4 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in the impaired discounted notes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $3.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
NOTE 6  Property Tax-Exempt Bond Financings, Property Loans Payable and Other Borrowings
The following table summarizes our property tax-exempt bond financings related to properties classified as held for use at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the majority of which is non-recourse to us (in thousands):
Fixed rate property tax-exempt bonds payable mature at various dates through December 2049. Variable rate property tax-exempt bonds payable mature at various dates through June 2038. Principal and interest on these bonds are generally payable in semi-annual installments with balloon payments due at maturity. Certain of our property tax-exempt bonds at December 31, 2009, are remarketed periodically by a remarketing agent to maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. We believe that the likelihood of this occurring is remote. At December 31, 2009, our property tax-exempt bond financings related to properties classified as held for use were secured by 39 properties with a combined net book value of $837.7 million. As discussed in Note 2, certain fixed rate property tax-exempt bonds payable have been converted to variable rates using total rate of return swaps and are presented above as variable rate debt at their carrying amounts, or fair value.
 
The following table summarizes our property loans payable related to properties classified as held for use at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the majority of which are non-recourse to us (in thousands):
Fixed rate property notes payable mature at various dates through August 2053. Variable rate property notes payable mature at various dates through November 2030. Principal and interest are generally payable monthly or in monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. At December 31, 2009, our property notes payable related to properties classified as held for use were secured by 347 properties with a combined net book value of $5,863.6 million. As discussed in Note 2, certain fixed rate secured notes payable have been converted to variable rates using total rate of return swaps and are presented above as variable rate debt at their carrying amounts, or fair value.
At December 31, 2009, we had a secured revolving credit facility with a major life company that provided for borrowings of up to $200.0 million. In January 2010, the credit facility was modified to reduce allowed borrowings to the then outstanding amount of $46.3 million. The primary function of the facility is to secure short-term fully pre-payable non-recourse loans for a period of less than three years. The interest rate on the notes provided through the facility is 30-day LIBOR plus 0.78%. Each loan under the facility is treated as a separate borrowing and is secured by a specific property. None of the facility loans are cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted. This facility matures in October 2010, and has two one-year extension options for a $500,000 fee per extension. At December 31, 2009, outstanding borrowings of $34.5 million related to properties classified as held for use are included in 2012 maturities below based on the extension options.
Our consolidated debt instruments generally contain covenants common to the type of facility or borrowing, including financial covenants establishing minimum debt service coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants pertaining to our consolidated debt instruments.
Other borrowings totaled $53.1 million and $96.0 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, other borrowings includes $44.6 million in fixed rate obligations with interest rates ranging from zero to 10.0% and $8.5 million in variable rate obligations bearing interest at the prime rate plus 1.75%. The maturity dates for other borrowings range from 2010 to 2039, although certain amounts are due upon occurrence of specified events, such as property sales.
As of December 31, 2009, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our property tax-exempt bonds, property notes payable and other borrowings related to properties in continuing operations are as follows (in thousands):
NOTE 7  Term Loans and Credit Facility
We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. In addition to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and an Aimco subsidiary are also borrowers under the Credit Agreement.
 
As of December 31, 2009, the Credit Agreement consisted of aggregate commitments of $270.0 million, comprised of the $90.0 million outstanding balance on the term loan and $180.0 million of revolving loan commitments. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%, or at our option, a base rate equal to the prime rate, and matures March 2011. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (either at LIBOR plus 4.25% with a LIBOR floor of 2.00% or, at our option, a base rate equal to the Prime rate plus a spread of 3.00%). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2011, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 45.0 basis point fee on the total revolving commitments and repayment of the remaining term loan balance by February 1, 2011. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, while any balance under the term loan is outstanding, repurchases of our Common Stock are permitted with 50% of net asset sale proceeds if the other 50% of such net asset sale proceeds are applied to repay the term loan. The Credit Agreement permits us to increase revolving commitments by up to $320.0 million, subject to our obtaining such commitments from eligible lenders.
The Credit Agreement includes customary financial covenants, including the maintenance of specified ratios with respect to total indebtedness to gross asset value, total secured indebtedness to gross asset value, aggregate recourse indebtedness to gross asset value, variable rate debt to total indebtedness, debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage; the maintenance of a minimum adjusted tangible net worth; and limitations regarding the amount of cross-collateralized debt. The Credit Agreement includes other customary covenants, including a restriction on distributions and other restricted payments, but permits distributions during any four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount of up to 95% of our funds from operations for such period, subject to certain non-cash adjustments, or such amount as may be necessary to maintain our REIT status. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2009.
The lenders under the Credit Agreement may accelerate any outstanding loans if, among other things: we fail to make payments when due (subject to applicable grace periods); material defaults occur under other debt agreements; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events occur; material judgments are entered against us; we fail to comply with certain covenants, such as the requirement to deliver financial information or the requirement to provide notices regarding material events (subject to applicable grace periods in some cases); indebtedness is incurred in violation of the covenants; or prohibited liens arise.
At December 31, 2009, the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of $90.0 million and an interest rate of 1.73%. We repaid $45.0 million of the term loan through February 26, 2010, leaving a remaining outstanding balance of $45.0 million. At December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2009, was $136.2 million (after giving effect to $43.8 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally permitted to be used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes.
On February 3, 2010, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to our Credit Agreement, which provides for a reduction in the minimum threshold for our debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and an increase in the maximum threshold for our secured indebtedness ratio.
NOTE 8  Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
In connection with our redevelopment and capital improvement activities, we have commitments of approximately $4.8 million related to construction projects that are expected to be completed during 2010. Additionally, we enter into certain commitments for future purchases of goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
As discussed in Note 5, we have committed to fund an additional $4.6 million in loans on certain properties in West Harlem in New York City. In certain circumstances, the obligor under these notes has the ability to put properties to us, which would result in a cash payment between $30.0 and $97.5 million and the assumption of approximately $119.0 million in property debt. The ability to exercise the put and the amount of cash payment required upon exercise is dependent upon the achievement of specified thresholds by the current owner of the properties.
As discussed in Note 11, we have a potential obligation to repurchase $30.0 million in liquidation preference of our Series A Community Reinvestment Act Preferred Stock for $21.0 million.
 
Tax Credit Arrangements
We are required to manage certain consolidated real estate partnerships in compliance with various laws, regulations and contractual provisions that apply to our historic and low-income housing tax credit syndication arrangements. In some instances, noncompliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and require a refund or reduction of investor capital contributions, which are reported as deferred income in our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. The remaining compliance periods for our tax credit syndication arrangements range from less than one year to 15 years. We do not anticipate that any material refunds or reductions of investor capital contributions will be required in connection with these arrangements.
Legal Matters
In addition to the matters described below, we are a party to various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which are covered by our general liability insurance program, and none of which we expect to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Limited Partnerships
In connection with our acquisitions of interests in real estate partnerships and our role as general partner in certain real estate partnerships, we are sometimes subject to legal actions, including allegations that such activities may involve breaches of fiduciary duties to the partners of such real estate partnerships or violations of the relevant partnership agreements. We may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of such litigation. We believe that we comply with our fiduciary obligations and relevant partnership agreements. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not expect any such legal actions to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Environmental
Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain hazardous substances present on a property, including lead-based paint. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous substances. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remedy properly, hazardous substances may adversely affect occupancy at affected apartment communities and the ability to sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by government agencies, and potential fines or penalties imposed by such agencies in connection therewith, the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal, remediation or disposal of hazardous substances through a licensed disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of properties, we could potentially be liable for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our properties or properties we acquire or manage in the future.
We have determined that our legal obligations to remove or remediate hazardous substances may be conditional asset retirement obligations, as defined in GAAP. Except in limited circumstances where the asset retirement activities are expected to be performed in connection with a planned construction project or property casualty, we believe that the fair value of our asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated due to significant uncertainties in the timing and manner of settlement of those obligations. Asset retirement obligations that are reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2009, are immaterial to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Mold
We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits that have alleged personal injury and property damage as a result of the presence of mold. In addition, we are aware of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold, some of which have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. We have only limited insurance coverage for property damage loss claims arising from the presence of mold and for personal injury claims related to mold exposure. We have implemented policies, procedures, third-party audits and training, and include a detailed moisture intrusion and mold assessment during acquisition due diligence. We believe these measures will prevent or eliminate mold exposure from our properties and will minimize the effects that mold may have on our residents. To date, we have not incurred any material costs or liabilities relating to claims of mold exposure or to abate mold conditions. Because the law regarding mold is unsettled and subject to change, we can make no assurance that liabilities resulting from the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Operating Leases
We are obligated under office space and equipment non-cancelable operating leases. In addition, we sublease certain of our office space to tenants under non-cancelable subleases. Approximate minimum annual rentals under operating leases and approximate minimum payments to be received under annual subleases are as follows (in thousands):
Substantially all of the office space subject to the operating leases described above are for the use of our corporate offices and area operations. Rent expense recognized totaled $7.7 million, $10.2 million and $9.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Sublease receipts that offset rent expense totaled approximately $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
As discussed in Note 3, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we commenced restructuring activities pursuant to which we vacated certain leased office space for which we remain obligated. In connection with the restructurings, we accrued amounts representing the estimated fair value of certain lease obligations related to space we are no longer using, reduced by estimated sublease amounts. At December 31, 2009, approximately $6.9 million related to the above operating lease obligations was included in accrued liabilities related to these estimates.
 
NOTE 9  Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the taxable REIT subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows (in thousands):
As of December 31, 2009, we determined a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets was necessary for certain state net operating losses based on a determination that it was more likely than not that such assets will not be realized prior to their expiration.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our unrecognized tax benefits is presented below:
We do not anticipate any material changes in existing unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. Because the statute of limitations has not yet elapsed, our Federal income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2006, and subsequent years and certain of our State income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2004, and subsequent years are currently subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities. As discussed in Note 2, the IRS has issued us summary reports including its proposed adjustments to the Aimco Operating Partnership's 2007 and 2006 Federal tax returns. We do not expect the proposed adjustments to have any material effect on our unrecognized tax benefits, financial condition or results of operations. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to income taxes in income taxes in our consolidated statements of income.
In accordance with the accounting requirements for stock-based compensation, our deferred tax assets at December 31, 2008, are net of $3.6 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and vested restricted stock awards. As of December 31, 2009, we had no such excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and vested restricted stock awards.
The cost of land and depreciable property, net of accumulated depreciation, for federal income tax purposes was approximately $4.6 billion.
 
Significant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows and are classified within income tax benefit in continuing operations and income from discontinued operations, net in our statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):
Consolidated losses subject to tax, consisting of pretax income or loss of our taxable REIT subsidiaries and gains or loss on certain property sales that are subject to income tax under section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $40.6 million, $81.8 million and $41.5 million, respectively. The reconciliation of income tax attributable to continuing and discontinued operations computed at the U.S. statutory rate to income tax benefit is shown below (dollars in thousands):
 
Income taxes paid totaled approximately $4.6 million, $13.8 million and $3.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
At December 31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $60.6 million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2027 to 2029. Subject to certain separate return limitations, we may use these NOLs to offset all or a portion of taxable income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We generated approximately $45.9 million of NOLs during the year ended December 31, 2009, as a result of losses from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The deductibility of intercompany interest expense with our taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to certain intercompany limitations based upon taxable income as required under Section 163(j) of the Code. As of December 31, 2009, interest carryovers of approximately $24.6 million, limited by Section 163(j) of the Code, are available against U.S. Federal tax without expiration. The deferred tax asset related to these interest carryovers is approximately $9.6 million. Additionally, our low-income housing and rehabilitation tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2009, were approximately $7.4 million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2012 to 2028.
 
For income tax purposes, dividends paid to holders of Common Stock primarily consist of ordinary income, return of capital, capital gains, qualified dividends and unrecaptured Section 1250 gains, or a combination thereof. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, dividends per share held for the entire year were estimated to be taxable as follows:
NOTE 10  Transactions Involving Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership
In December 2008, October 2008, July 2008, and December 2007, the Aimco Operating Partnership declared special distributions payable on January 29, 2009, December 1, 2008, August 29, 2008 and January 30, 2008, respectively, to holders of record of common OP Units and High Performance Units on December 29, 2008, October 27, 2008, July 28, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The special distributions were paid on common OP Units and High Performance Units in the amounts listed below. The Aimco Operating Partnership distributed to us common OP Units equal to the number of shares we issued pursuant to our corresponding special dividends (discussed in Note 11) in addition to approximately $0.60 per unit in cash. Holders of common OP Units other than us and holders of High Performance Units received the distribution entirely in cash.
 
Preferred OP Units
Various classes of preferred OP Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership are outstanding. Depending on the terms of each class, these preferred OP Units are convertible into common OP Units or redeemable for cash, or at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option, Common Stock, and are paid distributions varying from 5.9% to 9.6% per annum per unit, or equal to the dividends paid on Common Stock based on the conversion terms. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, a total of 3.1 million and 3.2 million preferred OP Units were outstanding with redemption values of $85.7 million and $88.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, a total of 3.1 million and 3.1 million of these preferred OP Units with redemption values of $82.8 million and $85.2 million, respectively, were redeemable into approximately 5.2 million and 7.4 million shares of Common Stock, respectively, or cash at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option.
During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 68,200 and 38,400 preferred OP Units, respectively, were tendered for redemption in exchange for cash. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, no preferred OP Units were tendered for redemption in exchange for shares of Common Stock. The Aimco Operating Partnership has a redemption policy that requires cash settlement of redemption requests for the redeemable preferred OP Units, subject to limited exceptions.
Common OP Units
In 2007, we completed tender offers for limited partnership interests resulting in the issuance of approximately 55,400 common OP Units. Approximately 55,100 of the common OP Units issued in 2007 were to unrelated limited partners in VMS in connection with our purchase of seven properties from the partnership, as discussed in Note 3. In 2009 and 2008, we did not issue a significant number of common OP Units in connection with tender offers for limited partners.
During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 64,000 and 50,000 common OP Units, respectively, were redeemed in exchange for cash, and approximately 519,000 and 114,000 common OP Units, respectively, were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock.
High Performance Units
From 1998 through 2005, the Aimco Operating Partnership issued various classes of High Performance Units, or HPUs. These HPUs were issued to limited liability companies owned by certain members of our senior management (and independent directors in the case of Class I HPUs only) in exchange for cash in amounts that we determined, with the assistance of a nationally recognized independent valuation expert, to be the fair value of the HPUs. The terms of the HPUs provide for the issuance, following a measurement period of generally three years of an increased number of HPUs depending on the degree, if any, to which certain financial performance benchmarks are achieved over the applicable measurement period. The holders of HPUs at the conclusion of the measurement period receive the same amount of distributions that are paid to holders of an equivalent number of the Aimco Operating Partnership's outstanding common OP Units. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, 2,344,719 Class I HPUs, the sole class of HPUs to meet the performance benchmarks, were outstanding. The minimum performance benchmarks were not achieved for HPU Classes II through IX. Accordingly, those HPUs had only nominal value at the conclusion of the related measurement period and were reacquired by the Aimco Operating Partnership and cancelled.
 
NOTE 11  Aimco Equity
Preferred Stock
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had the following classes of preferred stock outstanding:
In connection with our June 2009 CRA Preferred Stock repurchase discussed above, we reflected the $1.8 million excess of the carrying value over the repurchase price, offset by $0.2 million of issuance costs previously recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, as a reduction of net income attributable to preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
During 2008, we repurchased 54 shares, or $27.0 million in liquidation preference, of our CRA Preferred Stock for cash totaling $24.8 million. We reflected the $2.2 million excess of the carrying value over the redemption price, offset by $0.7 million of issuance costs previously recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, as a reduction of net income attributable to preferred stockholders for purposes of calculating earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008.
All classes of preferred stock are pari passu with each other and are senior to our Common Stock. The holders of each class of preferred stock are generally not entitled to vote on matters submitted to stockholders. Dividends on all shares of preferred stock are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. All of the above outstanding classes of preferred stock have a liquidation preference per share of $25, with the exception of the CRA Preferred Stock, which has a liquidation preference per share of $500,000.
The dividends paid on each class of preferred stock classified as equity in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
Common Stock
In December 2008, October 2008, July 2008 and December 2007, in connection with the Aimco Operating Partnership's special distributions discussed in Note 10, our Board of Directors declared corresponding special dividends payable on January 29, 2009, December 1, 2008, August 29, 2008 and January 30, 2008, respectively, to holders of record of our Common Stock on December 29, 2008, October 27, 2008, July 28, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. A portion of the special dividends in the amounts of $0.60 per share represents payment of the regular dividend for the quarters ended December 31, 2008, September 30, 2008, June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, and the remaining amount per share represents an additional dividend associated with taxable gains from property dispositions. Portions of the special dividends were paid through the issuance of shares of Common Stock. The table below summarizes information regarding these special dividends.
 
As discussed in Note 2, during December 2009, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2010-01, which relate to accounting for dividends with components of cash and stock. In prior periods, we treated the shares of stock issued in our special dividends similar to stock dividends, with a reclassification within consolidated equity at the beginning of the earliest period presented. In connection with our adoption of ASU 2010-01, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008, by increasing accrued liabilities and other by $149.0 million, representing the portion of our special dividend declared in December 2008 that was paid in January 2009 through the issuance of common stock.
During 2008, we issued approximately 17,000 shares of Common Stock to certain non-executive officers who purchased the shares at market prices. In exchange for the shares purchased, the officers executed notes payable totaling $0.6 million. No shares were issued under similar arrangements during 2009. These notes, which are 25% recourse to the borrowers, have a 10-year maturity and bear interest either at a fixed rate of 6% annually or a floating rate based on the 30-day LIBOR plus 3.85%, which is subject to an annual interest rate cap of typically 7.25%. Total payments in 2009 and 2008 on all notes from officers were $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. In 2009 and 2008, we reacquired approximately 94,000 and 31,000 shares of Common Stock from officers in exchange for the cancellation of related notes totaling $1.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively.
In addition, in 2009 and 2008, we issued approximately 378,000 and 225,000 restricted shares of Common Stock, respectively, to certain officers and employees. The restricted stock was recorded at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of issuance. These shares of restricted Common Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of and are subject to a risk of forfeiture prior to the expiration of the applicable vesting period (ratably over a period of four years).
In 2008 and 2007, we purchased in the open market approximately 13.9 million and 7.5 million shares of Common Stock, respectively, at an average price per share of approximately $34.02 and $43.70, respectively. During 2009, we did not repurchase any shares of Common Stock on the open market.
Registration Statements
We and the Aimco Operating Partnership have a shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership.
 
NOTE 12  Share-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans
Stock Award and Incentive Plan
We adopted the Apartment Investment and Management Company 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, or the 1997 Plan, to attract and retain officers, key employees and independent directors. The 1997 Plan reserved for issuance a maximum of 20 million shares, which may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, or other types of awards as authorized under the 1997 Plan. The 1997 Plan expired on April 24, 2007. On April 30, 2007, the 2007 Stock Award and Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan, was approved as successor to the 1997 Plan. The 2007 Plan reserves for issuance a maximum of 4.1 million shares, which may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, or other types of awards as authorized under the 2007 Plan. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of the 2007 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance has been adjusted to reflect the special dividends discussed in Note 11. At December 31, 2009 there were approximately 1.7 million shares available to be granted under the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. In the case of stock options, the exercise price of the options granted may not be less than the fair market value of Common Stock at the date of grant. The term of the options is generally ten years from the date of grant. The options typically vest over a period of one to four or five years from the date of grant. We generally issue new shares upon exercise of options. Restricted stock awards typically vest over a period of three to five years.
Refer to Stock-Based Compensation in Note 2 for discussion of our accounting policy related to stock-based compensation.
We estimated the fair value of our options using a Black-Scholes closed-form valuation model using the assumptions set forth in the table below. For options granted in 2009 and 2008, the expected term of the options was based on historical option exercises and post-vesting terminations. For options granted in 2007, the expected term of the options reflects the average of the vesting period and the contractual term for the options, with the exception of a grant of approximately 0.6 million options to an executive during 2007, for which the expected term used was equal to the vesting period of five years. Expected volatility reflects the historical volatility of our Common Stock during the historical period commensurate with the expected term of the options that ended on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield reflects expectations regarding cash dividend amounts per share paid on our Common Stock during the expected term of the option and the risk-free interest rate reflects the annualized yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a term equal to the expected term of the option. The weighted average fair value of options and our valuation assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:
 
The following table summarizes activity for our outstanding stock options for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (numbers of options in thousands):
The intrinsic value of a stock option represents the amount by which the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. Options outstanding at December 31, 2009, had an aggregate intrinsic value of $5.7 million and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 4.4 years. Options exercisable at December 31, 2008, had no aggregate intrinsic value and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 5.7 years. No stock options were exercised during the year ended 2009. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, was less than $0.1 million and $28.9 million, respectively. We may realize tax benefits in connection with the exercise of options by employees of our taxable subsidiaries. As no stock options were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2009, we realized no related tax benefits.
The following table summarizes activity for restricted stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (numbers of shares in thousands):
The aggregate fair value of shares that vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $3.1 million, $16.5 million and $19.5 million, respectively.
 
Total compensation cost recognized for restricted stock and stock option awards was $8.0 million, $17.6 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these amounts, $1.3 million, $3.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, were capitalized. At December 31, 2009, total unvested compensation cost not yet recognized was $10.1 million. We expect to recognize this compensation over a weighted average period of approximately 1.5 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the terms of our employee stock purchase plan, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions up to 15% of their base compensation to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a five percent discount from its fair value on the last day of the calendar quarter during which payroll deductions are made. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, 20,076, 8,926 and 3,751 shares were purchased under this plan at an average price of $8.82, $23.86 and $44.67, respectively. No compensation cost is recognized in connection with this plan.
401(k) Plan
We provide a 401(k) defined-contribution employee savings plan. Employees who have completed 30 days of service and are age 18 or older are eligible to participate. For the period from January 1, 2009 through January 29, 2009, and during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, our matching contributions were made in the following manner: (1) a 100% match on the first 3% of the participant's compensation; and (2) a 50% match on the next 2% of the participant's compensation. On December 31, 2008, we suspended employer matching contributions effective January 29, 2009. We may reinstate employer matching contributions at any time. We incurred costs in connection with this plan of approximately $0.6 million, $5.2 million and $5.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
NOTE 13  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale
We report as discontinued operations real estate assets that meet the definition of a component of an entity and have been sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. We include all results of these discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes, in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of income under the heading "income from discontinued operations, net." This treatment resulted in the retrospective adjustment of 2009, 2008 and 2007 financial statement amounts to reflect as discontinued operations all properties sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2010.
We are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate whether such properties meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, including whether such properties are expected to be sold within 12 months. Additionally, certain properties that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date may nevertheless be sold and included in discontinued operations in the subsequent 12 months; thus the number of properties that may be sold during the subsequent 12 months could exceed the number classified as held for sale. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had 31 and 120 properties, with an aggregate of 5,825 and 28,328 units, classified as held for sale, respectively. Amounts classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in thousands):
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we sold 89, 151 and 73 consolidated properties with an aggregate 22,503, 37,202 and 11,588 units, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, discontinued operations includes the results of operations for the periods prior to the date of sale for all properties sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2010.
 
The following is a summary of the components of income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):
Gain on dispositions of real estate is reported net of incremental direct costs incurred in connection with the transaction, including any prepayment penalties incurred upon repayment of property loans collateralized by the property being sold. Such prepayment penalties totaled $29.0 million, $64.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We classify interest expense related to property debt within discontinued operations when the related real estate asset is sold or classified as held for sale. As discussed in Note 2, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we allocated $10.1 million of goodwill related to our real estate segment to the carrying amounts of the properties sold or classified as held for sale. Of these amounts, $8.7 million was reflected as a reduction of gain on dispositions of real estate and $1.4 million was reflected as an adjustment of impairment losses.
 
NOTE 14  Earnings per Share
We calculate earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, participating securities, common stock equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period. The following table illustrates the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands, except per share data):
As discussed in Note 2, earnings (loss) per common share for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of our adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 and FASB ASU 2010-01.
As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the common share equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in future periods totaled 8.9 million, 9.2 million and 8.1 million, respectively. These securities, representing stock options, have been excluded from the earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Participating securities, consisting of unvested restricted stock and shares purchased pursuant to officer loans, receive dividends similar to shares of Common Stock and totaled 0.5 million, 1.0 million and 1.2 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The effect of participating securities is reflected in basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the periods presented above using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the adjustment to compensation expense recognized related to cumulative dividends on forfeited shares of restricted stock exceeded the amount of dividends declared related to participating securities. Accordingly, distributed earnings attributed to participating securities during 2009 were reduced to zero for purposes of calculating earnings per share using the two-class method.
 
As discussed in Note 10, the Aimco Operating Partnership has various classes of preferred OP units, which may be redeemed at the holders' option. The Aimco Operating Partnership may redeem these units for cash or at its option, shares of Common Stock. During the periods presented, no common share equivalents related to these preferred OP units have been included in earnings per share computations because their effect was antidilutive.

Summarized unaudited consolidated quarterly information for 2009 and 2008 is provided below (in thousands, except per share amounts).
 
NOTE 16  Transactions with Affiliates
We earn revenue from affiliated real estate partnerships. These revenues include fees for property management services, partnership and asset management services, risk management services and transactional services such as refinancing, construction supervisory and disposition (including promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by certain of our consolidated joint ventures). In addition, we are reimbursed for our costs in connection with the management of the unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These fees and reimbursements for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $18.5 million, $72.5 million and $42.1 million, respectively. The total accounts receivable due from affiliates was $23.7 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million, at December 31, 2009, and $39.0 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2.8 million, at December 31, 2008.
Additionally, we earn interest income on notes from real estate partnerships in which we are the general partner and hold either par value or discounted notes. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not recognize a significant amount of interest income on par value notes from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Interest income earned on par value notes from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Accretion income recognized on discounted notes from affiliated real estate partnerships totaled $0.1 million, $1.4 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information on notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
NOTE 17  Business Segments
Based on a planned reduction in our transactional activities, during the three months ended March 31, 2010, we reevaluated our reportable segments and determined our investment management reporting unit no longer meets the requirements for a reportable segment. Additionally, to provide more meaningful information regarding our real estate operations, we elected to disaggregate information for the prior real estate segment. Following these changes, we have two reportable segments: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations. Our conventional real estate operations consist of market-rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and included 226 properties with 70,680 units as of December 31, 2009. Our affordable real estate operations consisted of 241 properties with 27,591 units as of December 31, 2009, with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Based on this change in reportable segments, we have recast the presentation of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, as presented below.
Our chief operating decision maker uses various generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance and financial conditions of the business, including: Net Asset Value, which is the estimated fair value of our assets, net of debt, or NAV; Funds From Operations, or FFO; Adjusted FFO, or AFFO, which is FFO less spending for Capital Replacements; same store property operating results; net operating income; Free Cash Flow which is net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. Our chief operating decision maker emphasizes net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Segment net operating income is generally defined as segment revenues less direct segment operating expenses.
 
The following tables present the revenues, net operating income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations of our conventional and affordable real estate operations segments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands):
 
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, for continuing operations, our rental revenues include $129.8 million, $122.2 million and $112.0 million, respectively, of subsidies from government agencies, which represented 11.8%, 11.1% and 10.6%, respectively, of our real estate operations revenues.
The assets of our reportable segments are as follows (in thousands):
For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, capital additions related to our conventional segment totaled $208.0 million, $516.6 million and $595.6 million, respectively, and capital additions related to our affordable segment totaled $67.4 million, $148.6 million and $94.1 million, respectively.
