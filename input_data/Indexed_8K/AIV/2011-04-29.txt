Exhibit 99.1
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company Announces First Quarter 2011 Results
Denver, Colorado  April 29, 2011  Apartment Investment and Management Company (NYSE: AIV) announced today its first quarter 2011 results.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: "Aimco executed its plan successfully during the quarter. Total Same Store property net operating income increased 8.5%, with a 2.1% increase in revenue and a 6.8% decrease in expenses. Offsite costs decreased 5% compared to first quarter 2010, and we remain committed to further reductions by deploying labor saving technology and by simplifying our business. We are off to a good start in 2011."
Chief Financial Officer Ernie Freedman adds: "First quarter Pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share exceeded the upper end of our guidance range by $0.02 per share, primarily as a result of better than expected property operating results. During the quarter, we further strengthened our balance sheet by reducing our 2011 property debt maturity exposure by $90 million and our 2012 exposure by $105 million. We are establishing second quarter Pro forma FFO guidance of $0.33 to $0.37 per share and increasing full year Pro forma FFO guidance from a range of $1.46 to $1.56 per share to a range of $1.49 to $1.59 per share."
Financial Results
Diluted Per Share Results
Net loss  Net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders for the quarter was $31.8 million, compared to net loss of $40.4 million for first quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 net loss decreased as compared to first quarter 2010 primarily due to an increase of $9.9 million in net operating income of our properties included in continuing operations, an increase of $4.7 million in net investment management income and a decrease of $4.1 million in depreciation and amortization. These increases in income were partially offset by a decrease in income from discontinued operations attributable to Aimco as a result of 2010 and 2011 property sales.
Funds from Operations  FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the glossary in Aimco's Supplemental Information (the Glossary). FFO calculated in accordance with the definition prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) was $44.4 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to $29.3 million, or $0.25 per share, in first quarter 2010. Pro forma FFO, which represents FFO as prescribed by NAREIT but excludes operating real estate impairment losses and preferred equity redemption related amounts, was $45.8 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to $36.9 million, or $0.32 per share, in first quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 Pro forma FFO of $0.39 per share was $0.02 per share above the upper end of Aimco's guidance range primarily as a result of better than expected property operating results.
 
Property Operations
Property operating results discussed below represent Aimco's Proportionate Share of reported amounts, which reflects property operating results adjusted for Aimco's ownership in each property. This non-GAAP measure is defined in the Glossary.
Diversified Operating Portfolio  Aimco's property operations consist primarily of Conventional, with some Affordable, real estate operations. Conventional real estate operations relate to Aimco's diversified portfolio of market rate apartment communities and include Same Store Properties, Redevelopment Properties, and Other Properties. Conventional Property operations generated 87% of Aimco's first quarter 2011 property net operating income (NOI). See Supplemental Schedules 7a and 7b for detailed information on Aimco's Conventional real estate portfolio, including selected operating results.
Affordable real estate operations consist of Aimco's portfolio of properties with rents that are generally paid, in whole or in part, by a government agency. Affordable properties tend to have more stable rents and higher occupancy than Conventional properties due to government rent payments and thus are less affected by market fluctuations. Affordable Property operations generated 13% of Aimco's first quarter 2011 NOI.
First Quarter Portfolio Operating Measures
*
Conventional Same Store Results  In first quarter 2011, the Conventional Same Store portfolio included 178 communities with 60,173 units, in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 94%.
Conventional Same Store Operating Measures
 
Comparing Conventional Same Store results in first quarter 2011 with first quarter 2010, total revenue increased $3.0 million, or 1.6%. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of higher average daily occupancy of 96.4% for first quarter 2011 compared to 96.0% for first quarter 2010, and higher average rent per unit, up $6 per unit or 0.6%, from $1,043 per unit to $1,049 per unit.
During first quarter 2011, Conventional Same Store expenses decreased $5.0 million or 6.6%, primarily as a result of decreases in employee related costs, real estate taxes, utilities, apartment unit turnover expenses, repairs and maintenance expenses and marketing costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher insurance costs. Refer to Supplemental Schedules 6a and 6b for additional details on Conventional Same Store operating results.
Conventional Same Store Rental Rate Trends  Aimco measures changes in rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same apartment. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or a renewal of an existing lease.
On average, first quarter 2011 new lease rates were 1.9% higher than expiring lease rates, compared to rates 0.9% higher than expiring lease rates in fourth quarter 2010. During first quarter 2011, renewal rates were 3.0% higher than expiring lease rates, compared to rates that were 1.6% higher than expiring lease rates in the fourth quarter 2010.
Affordable Same Store Results  In first quarter 2011, the Affordable Same Store portfolio included 145 communities with 17,469 units, in which Aimco had a weighted average ownership of 66%. For the first quarter 2011, average month-end occupancy for the affordable portfolio was 97.5%, an increase of 0.4% from first quarter 2010, while average rent per unit increased 4.4% from $797 to $832 per unit. During the first quarter 2011, Affordable Same Store expenses decreased 7.7% primarily as a result of lower contract services and administrative expenses.
Portfolio
Aimco's portfolio strategy focuses on B/B+ quality Conventional apartment communities located in the 20 largest U.S. markets as measured by total apartment value, with a target capital allocation of 10% to Affordable apartment communities.
Aimco measures Conventional Property asset quality based on average rents compared to local market average rents as reported by REIS, a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance information and analysis. Aimco defines A-quality assets as those with rents greater than 125% of local market average, B-quality assets as those with rents 90% to 125% of local market average and C-quality assets as those with rents less than 90% of local market average. For the fourth quarter 2010, the most recent period for which REIS information is available, Aimco's Conventional Property rents averaged 99% of local market average rents.
For the first quarter 2011, average rents for the Conventional portfolio were $1,060 per unit, a 2.5% increase compared to first quarter 2010, as a result of the sale of Conventional properties during 2010 with rents averaging 25% lower than the retained portfolio and positive rent growth in the retained portfolio.
Aimco's geographic allocation strategy focuses on the 20 largest U.S. markets. Aimco believes these markets to be deep, relatively liquid and possessing desirable long-term growth characteristics. These target markets are primarily coastal markets, and also include a number of Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois. In executing this strategy, Aimco expects to reduce its investment in markets outside the 20 largest markets and to increase its investment in the 20 largest markets through redevelopment, acquisitions and increasing ownership in properties Aimco already owns. During first quarter 2011, net operating income generated by Conventional properties located in the 20 largest markets accounted for 85% of total Conventional Property net operating income, an increase of 2% compared to first quarter 2010. In first quarter 2011, Aimco sold two Conventional properties and five Affordable properties with 478 and 647 units, respectively, for $28.9 million in gross proceeds. Aimco's share of net proceeds after distributions to limited partners, repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $9.2 million.
See Supplemental Schedules 7a and 7b for additional details regarding Aimco's portfolio quality and capital allocation, and Supplemental Schedule 8 for additional details on disposition activity.
Partnership Transaction Activity  During 2011, Aimco acquired the remaining noncontrolling limited partnership interests in six consolidated real estate partnerships that own nine properties and in which Aimco affiliates serve as general partner for a total cost of $6.1 million.
 
Termination of Fee Contracts  As of December 31, 2010, Aimco property managed or asset managed for a fee 321 properties associated with two distinct multifamily portfolios. During first quarter 2011, Aimco and the owners of one of these portfolios agreed to the termination of the asset and property management contracts associated with the portfolio. In connection with the termination of these management contracts, Aimco recognized $1.3 million of previously deferred asset management fee income during first quarter 2011.
Through this and other transactions during first quarter 2011, Aimco reduced its fee managed portfolio by 108 properties with 11,722 units, furthering the company's goal of simplifying its business and reducing costs. Refer to Supplemental Schedule 2 for details of Aimco's portfolio as of March 31, 2011.
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
See Supplemental Schedule 4 for additional details about Aimco's non-recourse property debt and Supplemental Schedule 5 for information related to Aimco's preferred securities.
Aimco's recourse debt at March 31, 2011, was limited to its revolving credit facility, which Aimco uses for working capital purposes and to secure letters of credit. At the end of first quarter, Aimco had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility and available capacity was $263.4 million, net of $36.6 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.
Aimco's first quarter EBITDA Coverage of Interest and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends ratios were 2.11:1 and 1.72:1, compared to fourth quarter 2010 ratios of 2.07:1 and 1.68:1, respectively. Separately, in connection with its revolving credit facility, Aimco is subject to Debt Service and Fixed Charge Coverage covenants, as defined in the Glossary. For first quarter 2011, Aimco's Debt Service and Fixed Charge Coverage ratios were 1.58:1 and 1.34:1, compared to covenants in place during the quarter of 1.40:1 and 1.20:1, respectively, and fourth quarter 2010 ratios of 1.57:1 and 1.33:1. Aimco expects to remain in compliance with these covenants.
From January 1, 2011 through the date of this release, Aimco has issued 1.5 million shares under its At-the-Market (ATM) offering program at a weighted average price of $24.69 per share, generating gross proceeds of $37.0 million. The proceeds from the ATM offering were used primarily to fund deleveraging activities and the partnership transactions described in this release.
Dividend  Aimco's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on its Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The dividend is payable May 31, 2011 to shareholders of record on May 20, 2011.

Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Aimco's ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rates and property operating results. Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond the control of Aimco, including, without limitation: financing risks, including the availability and cost of capital markets financing and the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which Aimco operates; the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; insurance risk, including the cost of insurance; natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; energy costs; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by Aimco. In addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.
Readers should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and the notes thereto, as well as the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Aimco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Supplemental Schedule 9
Capital Additions (in thousands, except per unit data) (unaudited)
All capital additions are classified as either Capital Replacements ("CR"), Capital Improvements ("CI"), Redevelopment or Casualties. Non-redevelopment and non-casualty capital additions are apportioned between CR and CI based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period Aimco has owned the property (i.e., the portion that was consumed during Aimco's ownership of the item represents CR; the portion of the item that was consumed prior to Aimco's ownership represents CI). See the Glossary for further descriptions.
Amounts below represent actual additions related to residential properties that are owned and managed by Aimco at the end of the period. These amounts include consolidated and unconsolidated properties and are not adjusted for Aimco's ownership interest in such properties. Amounts do not include capital additions related to:
See the Glossary for a reconciliation of these amounts to GAAP capital additions.
 
Glossary and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating Measures
This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco's definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity.
 
Properties that have been acquired during the twelve months prior to the current quarter-end that have not reached a stabilized level of occupancy during the current period and each period for which comparable results are presented.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES:
AFFO is Pro forma FFO, as defined below, less Capital Replacement additions, also defined below, and adjusted for the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of such Capital Replacements. Similar to FFO, AFFO is helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts.
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO):
Affordable Properties benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax credit equity, or rental assistance payments to the property owners. Under these programs, rent adjustments are made in accordance with property-specific contracts between Aimco and HUD, with rent increases generally based on an adjustment factor set by HUD annually. Aimco targets an investment in Affordable Properties of 10% or less of Net Asset Value, which serves to offset the volatility of our Conventional portfolio; provide revenue growth that over time is similar to that of Conventional Properties; expand our investment opportunities; and provide helpful positioning with government bodies, benefiting Aimco's business overall.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco's UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 93% of the common partnership units of the Aimco Operating Partnership.
AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP:
Non-GAAP measures representing Aimco's share of financial information discussed in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information. Aimco's proportionate share of financial information includes Aimco's share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Proportionate reporting benefits the users of Aimco's financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable only to Aimco stockholders. Aimco also refers to this measure as "Aimco's Share" of financial information. See Supplemental Schedules 1, 3 and 4 for reconciliation of Aimco's proportionate share of financial results to Aimco's consolidated financial statements.
AIMCO PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
 
CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATION
Conventional Properties represent Aimco's portfolio of market-rate apartment communities. Aimco focuses on owning and operating apartment communities with rents that are 100% to 125% of local market average rents and concentrates its investment in the 20 largest apartment markets in the United States, as measured by apartment value. Aimco targets an investment in Conventional Properties of 90% or more of Net Asset Value.
CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Aimco's adjusted total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which is reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves) to (b) the actual debt service, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO:
Unit count at 100% ownership multiplied by Aimco's ownership share. Effective Units may be used to analyze Aimco's proportionate financial measures on a per-unit basis.
EFFECTIVE UNITS:
 
EBITDA is equal to Aimco's adjusted total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined in Aimco's credit agreement capital addition reserves provided for in Aimco's credit agreement. EBITDA is the numerator used in Aimco's calculation of EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio and EBITDA Coverage of Preferred Dividends and Interest Ratio.
EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA):
before
The ratio of (a) Aimco's EBITDA to (b) total interest expense charges, as provided for in Aimco's credit agreement, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation. This ratio is similar to Aimco's Debt Service Coverage Ratio with the exception that Aimco's EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio does not include capital addition reserves in the numerator and does not include debt amortization or capitalized interest in the denominator, while Debt Service Coverage Ratio does include these items. Aimco's credit agreement does not contain any compliance thresholds for the EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio; however, Aimco management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST RATIO:
The ratio of (a) Aimco's EBITDA to (b) the sum of total interest expense and dividends/distributions on preferred shares/units, as provided for in Aimco's credit agreement, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation. This ratio is similar to Aimco's Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio with the exception that Aimco's EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends Ratio does not include capital addition reserves in the numerator and does not include debt amortization or capitalized interest in the denominator, while Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio does include these items. Aimco's credit agreement does not contain any compliance thresholds for the EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends Ratio; however, Aimco management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS RATIO:
As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Aimco's adjusted total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (which is reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves) to (b) fixed charges, which represents the sum of total interest expense, debt amortization and dividends/distributions on preferred shares/units, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO:
Aimco provides property management and/or asset management services for a portfolio of properties, primarily pursuant to long-term arrangements with affiliated parties. In certain cases, Aimco may indirectly own generally less than one percent of the operations of such properties through a partnership syndication or other fund.
FEE MANAGED PROPERTIES:
FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002 White Paper.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO):
In addition to FFO, Aimco uses to measure performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO as defined above, excluding operating real estate impairments and preferred stock redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Both operating real estate impairment losses and preferred stock redemption related amounts are recurring items that affect Aimco's operating results. Operating real estate impairment losses, net of related income tax benefits and noncontrolling interests, are excluded from Pro forma FFO because Aimco believes the inclusion of such losses in FFO is inconsistent with the treatment of gains on the disposition of operating real estate, which are not included in FFO. Aimco excludes preferred redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of operating results.
PRO FORMA FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Pro forma FFO)
 
FFO and Pro forma FFO are helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because they capture features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Net income (loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders as determined in accordance with GAAP is reconciled to FFO and Pro forma FFO as presented on Supplemental Schedule 1 below.
Affordable Properties that do not meet the Same Store property definition because (1) the property is under redevelopment, (2) the property is not managed by Aimco, and/or (3) Aimco's ownership in the property is less than 10%.
OTHER AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
Conventional Properties that have significant rent control restrictions, university housing properties and properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities.
OTHER CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships, certain other corporate expenses and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal).
OTHER EXPENSES, NET:
 
NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; off-site property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations and financing arrangements. NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. A reconciliation of NOI as presented in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information to Aimco's consolidated GAAP amounts is provided below and on the following page.

Same Store properties are those properties (1) that are managed by Aimco, (2) in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10%, and (3) that have reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy during the current period and each period for which comparable results are presented. Same Store properties are classified as either Conventional or Affordable and properties classified in the consolidated financial statements as held for sale are not included in Same Store. To ensure comparability between periods, the proportionate Conventional Same Store information shown on Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6b is based on Aimco's current period ownership.
