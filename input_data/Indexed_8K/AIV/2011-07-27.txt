Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Underwriting Agreement
     On July 26, 2011, Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company") and AIMCO Properties, L.P., the operating partnership through which the Company conducts its real estate activities (the "Operating Partnership"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, as representative of the underwriters (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell up to 800,000 shares of its 7.00% Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class Z Preferred Stock"), through the Underwriters in an underwritten public offering (the "Offering"). The Underwriters agreed to sell shares of Class Z Preferred Stock on a "best efforts" basis, and are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of securities. The Offering will terminate if it is not consummated by August 2, 2011, unless the Company consents, in its sole discretion, to extend such period. The Underwriters will receive a commission equal to 3.75% of such sales. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification provisions and closing conditions. The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The Company intends to contribute the estimated net proceeds of $18.5 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated transaction expenses) from the Offering to the Operating Partnership in exchange for a preferred interest in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership intends to use the amount received from the Company for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption of other preferred securities. The Offering is expected to close on July 29, 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.
     The Underwriters and their respective affiliates may provide from time to time in the future certain financial advisory, investment banking and other services for the Company in the ordinary course of their business, for which they may receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, from time to time, the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in the Company's debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future.
Amendment to Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AIMCO Properties, L.P.
     On July 26, 2011, AIMCO-GP, Inc. (the "General Partner"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the general partner of the Operating Partnership, entered into the Fourth Amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Aimco Operating Partnership, dated as of July 29, 1994 and amended and restated as of February 28, 2007 (as amended and/or supplemented from time to time), to permit the issuance of additional Class Z Partnership Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership, which have substantially identical economic terms as the Class Z Preferred Stock.
     The foregoing description of the Fourth Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fourth Amendment, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
     On July 26, 2011, the Company filed Articles Supplementary (the "Articles Supplementary") with the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland relating to the Class Z Preferred Stock, which Articles Supplementary were effective on filing. The Articles Supplementary classify 800,000 authorized but unissued shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock into 800,000 shares of Class Z Preferred Stock. The Class Z Preferred Stock entitles the holders thereof to cumulative cash dividends payable quarterly in an amount per share equal to $0.4375 per quarter. The liquidation preference for the Class Z Preferred Stock is $25 per share, plus an amount equal to accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends, whether or not earned or declared. The Class Z Preferred Stock is not redeemable prior to July 29, 2016, except in limited circumstances relating to the ownership limitation necessary to preserve the Company's qualification as a real estate investment trust. On and after July 29,
 
2016, the Company will be able to redeem the Class Z Preferred Stock for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, at a price per share equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated, accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date. The Class Z Preferred Stock ranks prior to the Class A Common Stock of the Company, and on the same level as the Company's remaining outstanding shares of preferred stock, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Holders of shares of the Class Z Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights. If, however, the Company has not paid dividends on the Class Z Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Class Z Preferred Stock, together with holders of other classes of preferred stock of the Company with similar rights, will be entitled to elect two additional directors to the Company's board of directors until all unpaid dividends on the Class Z Preferred Stock and such other series of preferred stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment and dividends thereon for the current quarterly period have been declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment. Certain material adverse changes to the terms of the Class Z Preferred Stock cannot be made without the affirmative vote of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Class Z Preferred Stock.
     The foregoing description of the Articles Supplementary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles Supplementary, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events
     On July 26, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the shares of the Class Z Preferred Stock. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

     (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
     (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; and
     (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) of this Section 6(a),
, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, further, that the parties hereby agree that the only such information in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus is that set forth in the first and second sentences of the third paragraph and in the ninth paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus, and the Underwriters hereby consent to the use in the Prospectus of such information.
provided, however
 
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Operating Partnership, each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any officer, director or employee thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 6, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus and any other prospectus relating to the Securities (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriters expressly for use therein as set forth in clause (a) above.
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iv) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm (in addition to local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties,
 
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 hereof whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto, unless (x) such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party and (y) the indemnifying party confirms in writing its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such settlement, compromise or judgment. Notwithstanding Section 6(a) hereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested that an indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless (A) such failure to reimburse the indemnified party is based on a dispute with a good faith basis as to either the obligation of the indemnifying party arising under this Section 6 to indemnify the indemnified party or the amount of such obligation and (B) the indemnifying party shall have notified the indemnified party of such good faith dispute prior to the date of such settlement.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or (b) hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative benefits received by the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by the Underwriters from the sale of Securities on behalf of the Company.
 
     The relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Operating Partnership or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     Each of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this subsection (d), each director, officer, employee or affiliate of the Underwriters and each person, if any who controls the Underwriters within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriters, and each officer and director of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the preceding two paragraphs.
     For purposes of this Section 6, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall be deemed one party, jointly and severally liable for any obligations hereunder.
     7. . If the Securities have not been sold prior to August 2, 2011, and if the Company shall not theretofore have consented (which consent may be given or withheld in the Company's sole discretion) to extend such date, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of the Underwriters or the Company, and the Company shall not then be under any liability to the Underwriters with respect to the Securities except as provided in the following sentence and in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof. If this Agreement shall be terminated as a result of the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof (other than Section 5(b) or 5(i)(i), (iii), (iv) or (v)) not being satisfied, the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters
Termination
 
for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representative, including fees and disbursements of counsel up to $75,000 in the aggregate, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
     8. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
     9. In all dealings hereunder, the Representative shall act on behalf of each Underwriter, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.

Apartment Investment and Management Company
     Re:     Offering of Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special Maryland counsel to Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and have been requested to render this opinion in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Company (Registration No. 333-173503) and all amendments through the date hereof (the "Registration Statement"), prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and effective on April 14, 2011, including a preliminary prospectus, dated April 14, 2011, included therein at the time the Registration Statement became effective (the "Base Prospectus"), the preliminary prospectus supplement, filed by the Company with the Commission on July 19, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Preliminary Prospectus"), and the prospectus supplement, filed by the Company with the Commission on July 27, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act (the "Prospectus Supplement," and together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), for offering by the Company of up to 800,000 shares (the "Shares") of Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated July 26, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, on behalf of the underwriters named therein, on the one hand, and the Company and AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, on the other hand. This opinion is being provided at your request in connection with the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K and supplements our opinion, dated April 14, 2011, previously filed as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement.
     In rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have reviewed the following documents (the "Documents"):
     (a) the Articles of Restatement of the Company filed on April 27, 2011 with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "SDAT") and the Articles Supplementary of the Company with respect to the Shares filed on July 26, 2011 with the SDAT, in each case as certified by the SDAT (collectively, the "Charter");
     (b) the Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), as in effect on the date hereof, as certified by an officer of the Company;
     (c) the Underwriting Agreement;
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company July 27, 2011 Page 2
     (d) the Registration Statement;
     (e) the Prospectus;
     (f) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the authorization and issuance of the Shares and the authorization of the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, certified by an officer of the Company;
     (g) a certificate of the SDAT as to the good standing of the Company, dated as of a recent date;
     (h) a certificate executed by an officer of the Company (the "Certificate"), dated as of the date hereof, as to certain factual matters; and
     (i) such other documents as we have considered necessary to the rendering of the opinion expressed below.
     In examining the Documents, and in rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following: (a) each of the parties to the Documents (other than the Company) has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents and each instrument, agreement, and other document executed in connection with the Documents to which such party is a signatory and each such party's (other than the Company's) obligations set forth in the Documents, are its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms; (b) each person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document on behalf of any such party (other than the Company) is duly authorized to do so; (c) each natural person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document is legally competent to do so; (d) the Documents accurately describe and contain the mutual understandings of the parties, there are no oral or written modifications of or amendments or supplements to the Documents and there has been no waiver of any of the provisions of the Documents by actions or conduct of the parties or otherwise; and (e) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or telecopies or portable document file (".PDF") copies conform to the original documents (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), all signatures on all documents submitted to us for examination (and including signatures on photocopies, telecopies and .PDF copies) are genuine, and all public records reviewed are accurate and complete. As to certain factual matters we have relied on the Certificate as to the factual matters set forth therein, which we assume to be accurate and complete.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Shares have been duly authorized and upon issuance and delivery against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
     The opinion set forth herein is subject to additional assumptions, qualifications, and limitations as follows:
     (a) We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Maryland. To the extent that any documents referred to herein are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland, we have assumed that the laws of such jurisdiction are the same as the laws of the State of Maryland.
     (b) We further assume that the issuance and sale of the Shares will not cause the Company to exceed the total limit of the authorized capital stock of the Company, as provided in the Charter.
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company July 27, 2011 Page 3
     (c) This opinion concerns only the effect of the laws (exclusive of the principles of conflict of laws) of the State of Maryland as currently in effect. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if any facts or circumstances come to our attention after the date hereof that might change this opinion.
     (d) We express no opinion as to compliance with the securities (or "blue sky") laws or the real estate syndication laws of the State of Maryland.
     (e) We assume that the issuance of the Shares by the Company will not cause any person to violate any of the provisions of the Charter relating to the Initial Holder Limit, the Look-Through Ownership Limit or the Ownership Limit (as those terms are defined in the Charter) and that the Company will not issue any shares of capital stock other than the Shares.
     (f) This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K and to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Shares.

Re:
Real Estate Investment Trust Opinion
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          You have requested our opinion as to the status of Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("AIMCO"), as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") as of the date hereof.
          In connection with our opinion, you have provided us with certain representations and covenants of officers of AIMCO relating to, among other things, properties, assets, income, distributions, stockholder ownership, organizational structure and other requirements, and the past, present and future conduct of AIMCO's business operations. We have assumed that such statements, representations and covenants are true as of the date hereof, and will continue to be true, without regard to any qualification as to knowledge and belief. In formulating our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documentation and information provided by you as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. For purposes of our opinion, we have not assumed any responsibility for investigating or independently verifying the facts and representations set forth in such documents, the partnership agreements and organizational documents for each of the corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies in which AIMCO holds a direct or indirect interest (the "Subsidiaries"), or any
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company July 27, 2011 Page 2
other document, and we have not undertaken any independent review of such information. In particular, we note that AIMCO engages in transactions in connection with which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware. We have, consequently, assumed and relied on AIMCO's representations that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion.
          Our opinion is based on the correctness of the assumption that there have been no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or any other state under the laws of which any of the Subsidiaries have been formed. In rendering our opinion, we have also considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations"), administrative rulings and the other interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service, all as they exist as of the date hereof. It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect). Any change which is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions herein. There can be no assurances, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court.
          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we are of the opinion that, commencing with AIMCO's initial taxable year ended December 31, 1994, AIMCO was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable, AIMCO to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. AIMCO's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, certain requirements including requirements relating to distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of AIMCO's operation for any particular taxable year satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
          Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to AIMCO or to any investment therein.

          This opinion has been prepared for you and may not be relied upon by anyone else without our prior written consent. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.

Exhibit 10.1
     This FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF AIMCO PROPERTIES, L.P., dated as of July 26, 2011 (this "Amendment"), is being executed by AIMCO-GP, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "General Partner"), as the general partner of AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), pursuant to the authority conferred on the General Partner by Section 7.3.C(7) of the Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AIMCO Properties, L.P., dated as of July 29, 1994 and restated as of February 28, 2007, as amended and/or supplemented from time to time (including all the exhibits thereto, the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined herein, shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.
     WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 4.2.A of the Agreement, the General Partner (i) is authorized to cause the Partnership to issue additional Partnership Preferred Units, for any Partnership purpose, at any time or from time to time, to the Partners or to other Persons, for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be established by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, and (ii) is authorized to determine the designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, powers and duties of Partnership Preferred Units.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
     1. The Agreement is hereby amended by the addition of a new exhibit, entitled "," in the form attached hereto, which shall be attached to and made a part of the Agreement.
Exhibit X
     2. Except as specifically amended hereby, the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of the Agreement shall remain unmodified and continue in full force and effect and, except as amended hereby, all of the terms, covenants, provisions and conditions of the Agreement are hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment has been executed as of the date first written above.
 
     
1. 
Number of Units and Designation.
     A class of Partnership Preferred Units is hereby designated as "Class Z Partnership Preferred Units," and the number of Partnership Preferred Units constituting such class shall be eight hundred thousand (800,000).
     
2. 
Definitions.
     For purposes of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated in this Section 2, and capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Agreement:
 
     
3. 
Distributions.
     On every Distribution Payment Date, the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive distributions payable in cash in an amount per Class Z Partnership Preferred Unit equal to the per share dividend payable on the Class Z Preferred Stock on such Distribution Payment Date. Each such distribution shall be payable to the holders of record of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, as they appear on the records of the Partnership at the close of business on the record date for the dividend payable with respect to the Class Z Preferred Stock on such Distribution Payment Date. Holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall not be entitled to any distributions on the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, whether payable in cash, property or stock, except as provided herein.
     
4. 
Liquidation Preference.
     (a) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the Partnership (whether capital, surplus or otherwise) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Partnership Units, the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) per Class Z Partnership Preferred Unit (the "Liquidation Preference"), plus an amount per Class Z Partnership Preferred Unit equal to all dividends (whether or not declared or earned) accumulated, accrued and unpaid on one share of Class Z Preferred Stock to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. Until the holders of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units have been paid the Liquidation Preference in full, plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not declared or earned) accumulated, accrued and unpaid on the Class Z Preferred Stock to the date of final distribution to such holders, no payment shall be made to any holder of Junior Partnership Units upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any Parity Partnership Units, then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units and any such Parity Partnership Units ratably in the same proportion as the respective amounts that would be payable on such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units and any such other Parity Partnership Units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 4, (i) a consolidation or merger of the Partnership with one or more partnerships, or (ii) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the Partnership.
 
     (b) Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, after payment shall have been made in full to the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units and any Parity Partnership Units, as provided in this Section 4, any other series or class or classes of Junior Partnership Units shall, subject to the respective terms thereof, be entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units and any Parity Partnership Units shall not be entitled to share therein.
     
5. 
Redemption.
     Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be redeemable by the Partnership as follows:
     (a) At any time that the Previous General Partner exercises its right to redeem all or any of the shares of Class Z Preferred Stock, the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to redeem an equal number of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, at a redemption price per Class Z Partnership Preferred Unit payable in cash and equal to the same price per share paid by the Previous General Partner to redeem the Class Z Preferred Stock. In the event of a redemption of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, if the redemption date occurs after a dividend record date for the Class Z Preferred Stock and on or prior to the related Distribution Payment Date, the distribution payable on such Distribution Payment Date in respect of such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units called for redemption shall be payable on such Distribution Payment Date to the holders of record of such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units on the applicable dividend record date, and shall not be payable as part of the redemption price for such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units.
     (b) If the Partnership shall redeem Class Z Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, from and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership shall fail to make available the amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (i) except for payment of the redemption price, the Partnership shall not make any further distributions on the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units so called for redemption, (ii) said units shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (iii) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units of the Partnership shall cease except the rights to receive the cash payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon; provided, however, that if the redemption date occurs after dividend record date for the Class Z Preferred Stock and on or prior to the related Distribution Payment Date, the full distribution payable on such Distribution Payment Date in respect of such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units called for redemption shall be payable on such Distribution Payment Date to the holders of record of such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units on the applicable dividend record date notwithstanding the prior redemption of such Class Z Partnership Preferred Units. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units to be redeemed on any cash set aside by the Partnership.
     (c) If fewer than all the outstanding Class Z Partnership Preferred Units are to be redeemed, units to be redeemed shall be selected by the Partnership from
 
outstanding Class Z Partnership Preferred Units not previously called for redemption by any method determined by the General Partner in its discretion. Upon any such redemption, the General Partner shall amend to the Agreement as appropriate to reflect such redemption.
Exhibit A
     
6. 
Status of Reacquired Units.
     All Class Z Partnership Preferred Units which shall have been issued and reacquired in any manner by the Partnership shall be deemed cancelled.
     
7. 
Ranking.
     Any class or series of Partnership Units of the Partnership shall be deemed to rank:
     (a) prior or senior to the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, as to the payment of distributions and as to distributions of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if the holders of such class or series shall be entitled to the receipt of distributions and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units ("Senior Partnership Units");
     (b) on a parity with the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, as to the payment of distributions and as to distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether or not the distribution rates, distribution payment dates or redemption or liquidation prices per unit or other denomination thereof be different from those of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units if (i) such class or series of Partnership Units shall be Class T Partnership Preferred Units, Class U Partnership Preferred Units, Class V Partnership Preferred Units, Class Y Partnership Preferred Units, Series A Community Reinvestment Act Perpetual Partnership Preferred Units, Class One Partnership Preferred Units, Class Two Partnership Preferred Units, Class Three Partnership Preferred Units, Class Four Partnership Preferred Units, Class Six Partnership Preferred Units or Class Seven Partnership Preferred Units, or (ii) the holders of such class or series of Partnership Units and the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be entitled to the receipt of distributions and of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up in proportion to their respective amounts of accrued and unpaid distributions per unit or other denomination or liquidation preferences, without preference or priority one over the other (the Partnership Units referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Parity Partnership Units"); and
     (c) junior to the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, as to the payment of distributions and as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, if (i) such class or series of Partnership Units shall be Partnership Common Units, Class I High Performance Partnership Units, Class Five Partnership Preferred Units, Class Eight Partnership Preferred Units, or (ii) the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be entitled to receipt of distributions or of amounts distributable
 
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of such class or series of Partnership Units (the Partnership Units referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as "Junior Partnership Units").
     
8. 
Special Allocations.
     (a) Gross income and, if necessary, gain shall be allocated to the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units for any Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal Years) to the extent that the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units receive a distribution on any Class Z Partnership Preferred Units (other than an amount included in any redemption pursuant to Section 5 hereof) with respect to such Fiscal Year.
     (b) If any Class Z Partnership Preferred Units are redeemed pursuant to Section 5 hereof, for the Fiscal Year that includes such redemption (and, if necessary, for subsequent Fiscal Years) (a) gross income and gain (in such relative proportions as the General Partner in its discretion shall determine) shall be allocated to the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units to the extent that the redemption amounts paid or payable with respect to the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units so redeemed exceeds the aggregate Capital Contributions (net of liabilities assumed or taken subject to by the Partnership) per Class Z Partnership Preferred Unit allocable to the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units so redeemed and (b) deductions and losses (in such relative proportions as the General Partner in its discretion shall determine) shall be allocated to the holders of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units to the extent that the aggregate Capital Contributions (net of liabilities assumed or taken subject to by the Partnership) per Class Z Partnership Preferred Unit allocable to the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units so redeemed exceeds the redemption amount paid or payable with respect to the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units so redeemed.
     
9. 
Restrictions on Ownership.
     The Class Z Partnership Preferred Units shall be owned and held solely by the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner.
     
10. 
General.
     (a) The ownership of Class Z Partnership Preferred Units may (but need not, in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner) be evidenced by one or more certificates. The General Partner shall amend to the Agreement from time to time to the extent necessary to reflect accurately the issuance of, and subsequent conversion, redemption, or any other event having an effect on the ownership of, Class Z Partnership Preferred Units.
Exhibit A
     (b) The rights of the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner, in their capacity as holders of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units, are in addition to and not in limitation of any other rights or authority of the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner, respectively, in any other capacity under the Agreement or applicable
 
law. In addition, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit or otherwise restrict the authority of the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner under the Agreement, other than in their capacity as holders of the Class Z Partnership Preferred Units.

Forward-Looking Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date and include certain risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Aimco's ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rates and property operating results. Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors,
 
some of which are beyond the control of Aimco, including, without limitation: financing risks, including the availability and cost of capital markets financing and the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which Aimco operates; the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; insurance risk, including the cost of insurance; natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; energy costs; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by Aimco.
     In addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.
     Readers should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and notes thereto, as well as the risk factors described in Aimco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forward-looking statements reflect management's judgment as of this date, and Aimco assumes no obligation to revise or update them to reflect future events or circumstances.
