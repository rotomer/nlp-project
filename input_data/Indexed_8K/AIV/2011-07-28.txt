Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Executive Overview
We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our stockholders. Our business plan to achieve this objective is to:
Our owned real estate portfolio includes 219 conventional properties with 68,972 units and 228 affordable properties with 26,540 units. Our conventional and affordable properties comprise 88% and 12%, respectively, of our total property Net Asset Value. For the three months ended December 31, 2010, our conventional portfolio monthly rents averaged $1,052 and provided 62% operating margins. These average rents increased from $1,042 for the three months ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, on average, conventional new lease rates were 2.3% lower than expiring lease rates, and conventional renewal rates were 1.5% higher than expiring lease rates. Notwithstanding the economic challenges of the last several years, our diversified portfolio of conventional and affordable properties generated improved property operating results from 2007 to 2010. From 2007 to 2010, the net operating income of our same store properties and total real estate operations increased by 1.2% and 5.8%, respectively.
We continue to work toward simplifying our business, including de-emphasizing transaction-based activity fees and, as a result, reducing the cost of personnel involved in those activities. Revenues from transactional activities decreased from $68.2 million during 2008 to $7.9 million during 2010, and during 2010 transactional activities generated approximately 3.0% of our Pro forma Funds From Operations (defined below). Additionally, we have reduced our offsite costs by $16.8 million. Our 2010, 2009 and 2008 results are discussed in the Results of Operations section below.
We upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the sale of assets with lower projected returns, which are often in markets less desirable than our target markets, and reinvest these proceeds through the purchase of new assets or additional investment in existing assets in our portfolio, through increased ownership or redevelopment. We prefer the redevelopment of select properties in our existing portfolio to ground-up development, as we believe it provides superior risk adjusted returns with lower volatility.
Our leverage strategy focuses on increasing financial returns while minimizing risk. At December 31, 2010, approximately 86% of our leverage consisted of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt and 13% consisted of perpetual preferred equity, a combination which helps to limit our refunding and re-pricing risk. At December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding corporate level debt. Our leverage strategy limits refunding risk on our property-level debt. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average maturity of our property-level debt was 7.8 years, with 2% of our debt maturing in 2011, less than 9% maturing in 2012, and on average approximately 7% maturing in each of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Long duration, fixed-rate liabilities provide a hedge against increases in interest rates and inflation. Approximately 91% of our property-level debt is fixed-rate. Of the $104.9 million of property debt maturing during 2011, we completed the refinance of $79.4 million in February 2011, and we are focusing on refinancing our property debt maturing during 2012 through 2015 to extend maturities and lock in current low interest rates.
During 2010, we repaid the remaining $90.0 million on our term loan. We also expanded our credit facility from $180.0 million to $300.0 million, providing additional liquidity for short-term or unexpected cash requirements. As of December 31, 2010, we had the capacity to borrow $260.3 million pursuant to our credit facility (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2013, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions.
 
The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are: Net Asset Value; Pro forma Funds From Operations, which is Funds From Operations excluding operating real estate impairment losses and preferred equity redemption related amounts; Adjusted Funds From Operations, which is Pro forma Funds From Operations less spending for Capital Replacements; property net operating income, which is rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes; proportionate property net operating income, which reflects our share of property net operating income of our consolidated and unconsolidated properties; same store property operating results; Free Cash Flow, which is net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; Free Cash Flow internal rate of return; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. Funds From Operations is defined and further described in the section captioned "Funds From Operations." The key macro-economic factors and non-financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are: household formations; rates of job growth; single-family and multifamily housing starts; interest rates; and availability and cost of financing.
Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties, the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment properties affect our operating results. Our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings.
Highlights of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, are summarized below:
The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Results of Operations
Overview
2010 compared to 2009
We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $71.7 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to net loss attributable to Aimco of $64.3 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, increases of $7.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively. These increases in net loss were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below:
The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by:
 
2009 compared to 2008
We reported net loss attributable to Aimco of $64.3 million and net loss attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to net income attributable to Aimco of $412.0 million and net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders of $351.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreases of $476.3 million and $466.1 million, respectively. These decreases in net income were principally due to the following items, all of which are discussed in further detail below:
The effects of these items on our operating results were partially offset by:
The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail.
Real Estate Operations
Our real estate portfolio is comprised of two business components: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations, which also represent our two reportable segments. Our conventional real estate portfolio consists of market-rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and includes 219 properties with 68,972 units. Our affordable real estate portfolio consists of 228 properties with 26,540 units, with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Our conventional and affordable properties contributed 88% and 12%, respectively, of proportionate property net operating income amounts during the year ended December 31, 2010.
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we consolidate certain properties in which we hold an insignificant economic interest and in some cases we do not consolidate other properties in which we have a significant economic interest. Due to the diversity of our economic ownership interests in our properties, our chief operating decision maker emphasizes proportionate property net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss. Accordingly, the results of operations of our conventional and affordable segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis.
We do not include property management revenues and expenses or casualty related amounts in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. The effects of these items on our real estate operations results are discussed below on a consolidated basis, that is, before adjustments for noncontrolling interests or our interest in unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
 
The tables and discussions below reflect the proportionate results of our conventional and affordable segments and the consolidated results related to our real estate operations not allocated to segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands). The tables and discussions below exclude the results of operations for properties sold or classified as held for sale through March 31, 2011. Refer to Note 17 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reporting segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.
Conventional Real Estate Operations
Our conventional segment consists of conventional properties we classify as same store, redevelopment and other conventional properties. Same store properties are properties we manage and that have reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy (greater than 90%) during the current and prior year comparable period. Redevelopment properties are those in which a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or have not been stabilized in occupancy for at least one year as of the earliest period presented, or for which other significant non-unit renovations are underway or have been complete for less than one year. Other conventional properties may include conventional properties that have significant rent control restrictions, acquisition properties, university housing properties and properties that are not multifamily, such as commercial properties or fitness centers. Our definitions of same store and redevelopment properties may result in these populations differing for the purpose of comparing 2010 to 2009 results and 2009 to 2008 results.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, our same store portfolio decreased on a net basis by 4 properties with a corresponding net increase of 526 units. These changes consisted of:
After these adjustments, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, our conventional same store portfolio consisted of 156 properties with 53,551 units.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, our conventional segment's proportionate property net operating income increased $8.9 million, or 1.8%.
Conventional same store net operating income increased by $1.1 million. This increase was attributable to a $2.4 million decrease in expense primarily due to a reduction during 2010 of previously estimated real estate tax obligations resulting from successful appeals settled during the period, and decreases in marketing expenses and unit turn costs, partially offset by increases in contract services, insurance and administrative costs. This decrease in expense was partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in revenue, primarily due to lower average rent (approximately $33 per unit). The decrease in average rent was partially offset by a 200 basis point increase in average physical occupancy and higher utility reimbursement and miscellaneous income. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2010, were 2.3% lower than expiring lease rates and renewal rates were 1.5% higher than expiring lease rates.
The net operating income of our conventional redevelopment properties increased by $7.1 million, primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in revenue resulting from higher average physical occupancy and an increase in utility reimbursement and miscellaneous income, and a $1.3 million reduction in expense primarily related to marketing expenses, partially offset by higher insurance.
 
Our other conventional net operating income increased by $0.7 million, primarily due to increases in both revenue and expense of approximately 2.0%.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, our conventional segment's proportionate property net operating income decreased $6.3 million, or 1.3%.
Our conventional same store net operating income decreased $16.0 million, or 4.3%. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $15.0 million decrease in revenue, primarily due to a 1.0% decline in rental rates and a 90 basis point decrease in occupancy, partially offset by an increase in utility reimbursements and miscellaneous income. The decrease was also attributable to a $1.0 million increase in expense, primarily due to higher insurance and personnel costs, partially offset by lower administrative costs.
Conventional redevelopment net operating income increased by $10.6 million, primarily due to an $11.5 million increase in revenue. Revenue increased due to more units in service at these properties during 2009 and an increase in utility reimbursements and miscellaneous income. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in expense, primarily related to higher real estate taxes, partially offset by lower administrative costs.
Our other conventional net operating income decreased by $0.9 million, primarily due to a 6.9% increase in expenses partially offset by a 1.8% increase in revenues.
 
Affordable Real Estate Operations
Our affordable segment consists of properties we classify as same store or other (primarily redevelopment properties). Our criteria for classifying affordable properties as same store or redevelopment are consistent with those for our conventional properties described above. Our definitions of same store and redevelopment properties may result in these populations differing for the purpose of comparing 2010 to 2009 results and 2009 to 2008 results.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, 13 redevelopment properties with 1,579 units met the requirements to be classified as same store. This reclassification is in addition to properties that were sold or classified as held for sale and therefore reclassified into discontinued operations.
The proportionate property net operating income of our affordable segment increased $4.1 million, or 6.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009. Affordable same store net operating income increased by $2.6 million, primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in revenue due to higher average rent ($22 per unit) and higher average physical occupancy (12 basis points). The net operating income of our other affordable properties increased by $1.5 million, primarily due to an increase in revenue driven by higher average rent ($23 per unit) and higher average occupancy.
Our affordable segment proportionate property net operating income increased $4.8 million, or 7.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008. Affordable same store net operating income increased $4.3 million, primarily due to increased revenue. Affordable same store revenue increased by $4.4 million, primarily due to higher average rent ($36 per unit), partially offset by lower average physical occupancy (39 basis points). The net operating income of our other affordable properties increased by $0.5 million, primarily due to an increase in revenues due to higher average rent ($43 per unit), partially offset by lower average occupancy. The increase in revenues was partially offset by an increase in expenses.
Non-Segment Real Estate Operations
Real estate operations net operating income amounts not attributed to our conventional or affordable segments include property management revenues and expenses and casualty losses, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, property management revenues decreased by $2.2 million, from $5.1 million to $2.9 million, primarily due to the elimination of revenues related to properties consolidated during 2010 in connection with our adoption of revised accounting guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). For the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 2009, expenses not allocated to our conventional or affordable segments, including property management expenses and casualty losses, decreased by $3.1 million. Property management expenses decreased by $3.0 million, from $51.2 million to $48.2 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs attributed to our restructuring activities and casualty losses decreased by $0.1 million, from $9.7 million to $9.6 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, property management revenues decreased by $1.3 million, from $6.4 million to $5.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in the number of managed properties due to asset sales. For the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 2008, expenses not allocated to our conventional or affordable segments decreased by $16.8 million. Property management expenses decreased by $16.6 million, from $67.8 million to $51.2 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs attributed to our restructuring activities, and casualty losses decreased by $0.2 million, from $9.9 million to $9.7 million.
Asset Management and Tax Credit Revenues
We perform activities and services for consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, including portfolio strategy, capital allocation, joint ventures, tax credit syndication, acquisitions, dispositions and other transaction activities. These activities are conducted in part by our taxable subsidiaries, and the related net operating income may be subject to income taxes.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, asset management and tax credit revenues decreased $14.3 million. This decrease is attributable to an $8.7 million decrease in income related to our affordable housing tax credit syndication business. Approximately $3.8 million of this decrease is due to the delivery of historic credits during 2009 for which no comparable credits were delivered during 2010, and the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in amortization of deferred tax credit income. Asset management and tax credit revenues also decreased due to a $2.0 million decrease in current asset management fees due to the elimination of fees on newly consolidated properties, for which the benefit of these fees is now included in noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, a $1.9 million decrease in disposition and other fees we earn in connection with transactional activities, and a $1.7 million decrease in promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by our consolidated joint ventures.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, asset management and tax credit revenues decreased $49.0 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a $42.8 million decrease in promote income due to fewer sales of joint venture assets in 2009, a $7.6 million decrease in other general partner transactional fees, and a $2.2 million decrease in asset management fees, partially offset by a $3.6 million increase in revenues related to our affordable housing tax credit syndication business, including syndication fees and other revenue earned in connection with these arrangements.
Investment Management Expenses
Investment management expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel that perform asset management and tax credit activities. For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, investment management expenses decreased $1.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to a $4.3 million reduction in personnel and related costs from our organizational restructurings, partially offset by a $3.0 million net increase in expenses, primarily related to our write off of previously deferred costs related to tax credit projects we recently abandoned.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, investment management expenses decreased $9.0 million, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs from our organizational restructurings (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and a reduction in transaction costs, which in 2008 include the retrospective application of SFAS 141(R).
 
Depreciation and Amortization
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, depreciation and amortization decreased $3.1 million, or 0.7%. This decrease was primarily due to depreciation adjustments recognized in 2009 to reduce the carrying amount of certain properties. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation primarily related to properties we consolidated during 2010 based on our adoption of revised accounting guidance regarding consolidation of variable interest entities (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and completed redevelopments and other capital projects recently placed in service.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, depreciation and amortization increased $51.1 million, or 13.7%. This increase primarily consists of depreciation related to properties acquired during the latter part of 2008, completed redevelopments and other capital projects placed in service in the latter part of 2009.
Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets
In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in our Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the decline in land values in Southern California during 2008 and the expected timing of our redevelopment efforts, we determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, recognized an impairment loss of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax).
Similarly, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the three months ended December 31, 2008.
The impairments discussed above totaled $91.1 million and are included in provisions for impairment losses on real estate development assets in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in Item 8. We recognized no similar impairments on real estate development assets during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.
General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.3 million, or 5.8%. This decrease is primarily attributable to net reductions in personnel and related expenses, partially offset by an increase in information technology outsourcing costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, general and administrative expenses decreased $23.7 million, or 29.5%. This decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in personnel and related expenses associated with our organizational restructurings (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), pursuant to which we eliminated approximately 400, or 36%, of our offsite positions between December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009.
As a result of our restructuring activities, our general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 6.9% in 2008, to 5.1% in 2009 and 4.7% in 2010.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non-recurring items.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, other expenses, net decreased by $4.3 million. During 2009, we settled certain litigation matters resulting in a net expense in our operations, and in 2010 we settled certain litigation matters that resulted in a net gain in our operations. The effect of the expense in 2009 and gain in 2010 resulted in a $14.8 million decrease in other expenses, net from 2009 to 2010. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of our insurance (net of a reduction in the number of properties insured from 2009 to 2010).
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, other expenses, net decreased by $6.8 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $5.4 million write-off during 2008 of certain communications hardware and capitalized costs in 2008, and a $5.3 million reduction in expenses of our self insurance activities, including a decrease in casualty losses on less than wholly owned properties from 2008 to 2009. These decreases are partially offset by an increase of $4.8 million in costs related to certain litigation matters.
 
Restructuring Costs
For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized restructuring costs of $11.2 million, as compared to $22.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2008, related to our organizational restructurings, which are further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized no similar restructuring costs.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest on notes receivable from non-affiliates and unconsolidated real estate partnerships, interest on cash and restricted cash accounts, and accretion of discounts on certain notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Transactions that result in accretion may occur infrequently and thus accretion income may vary from period to period.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income increased $2.0 million, or 22.5%. Interest income increased during 2010 primarily due to an increase of accretion income related to a change in timing and amount of collection for certain of our discounted notes, including several notes that were repaid in advance of their maturity dates.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, interest income decreased $10.4 million, or 53.4%. Interest income decreased by $8.6 million due to lower interest rates on notes receivable, cash and restricted cash balances and lower average balances and by $4.1 million due to a decrease in accretion income related to our note receivable from Casden Properties LLC for which we ceased accretion following impairment of the note in 2008. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accretion income related to other notes during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from a change in the timing and amount of collection.
Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $0.9 million, $21.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively. The provisions for losses on notes receivable for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, primarily consist of impairments related to our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which are discussed further below.
As further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have an investment in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to acquire, re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we account for this investment as a note receivable. In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements and as a result of a decline in land values in Southern California, we determined our recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2008. In connection with the preparation of our 2009 annual financial statements and as a result of continued declines in land values in Southern California, we determined our then recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized an impairment loss of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2009.
In addition to the impairments related to Casden Properties LLC discussed above, we recognized provisions for losses on notes receivable totaling $0.9 million, $0.8 million and $1.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $0.5 million. Corporate interest expense decreased $7.6 million, primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance on our term loan, which we repaid during July 2010. This decrease in corporate interest expense was partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in property related interest expense, due to a $2.9 million net increase related to properties newly consolidated and deconsolidated in 2010 (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our adoption of ASU 2009-17) and an increase related to properties refinanced with higher average outstanding balances, partially offset by lower average rates.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, interest expense increased $1.2 million, or 0.4%. Property related interest expense increased by $20.6 million, primarily due to a $14.2 million decrease in capitalized interest due to a reduction in redevelopment during 2009, and an increase of $5.2 million related to properties refinanced with higher average rates, partially offset by lower average outstanding balances during 2009. The increase in property related interest expense was offset by a $19.4 million decrease in corporate interest expense, primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and lower average rates during 2009.
Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
Equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships includes our share of net losses of our unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and may include impairment losses, gains or losses on the disposition of real estate assets or depreciation expense which generally exceeds the net operating income recognized by such unconsolidated partnerships.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $11.7 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, certain of our consolidated investment partnerships, including those we consolidated in 2010 in connection with our adoption of ASU 2009-17, reduced by $9.8 million their investment balances related to unconsolidated low income housing tax credit partnerships based on a reduction in the remaining tax credits to be delivered. This increase in equity in losses was in addition to an increase in equity in losses from real estate operations due to an increase in the number of unconsolidated partnerships, resulting from our consolidation during 2010 of additional investment partnerships that hold investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These losses had an insignificant effect on net loss attributable to Aimco during 2010 as substantially all of the results of these consolidated investment partnerships are attributed to the noncontrolling interests in these entities.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased $6.7 million. The increase in our equity in losses from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to our sale in late 2008 of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership that generated $3.0 million of equity in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2008, and our sale during 2009 of our interest in an unconsolidated group purchasing organization which resulted in a decrease of equity in earnings of approximately $1.2 million.
Gain on Dispositions of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other
Gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other includes gains on disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, gains on dispositions of land and other non-depreciable assets and certain costs related to asset disposal activities. Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $10.9 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to $8.6 million of additional proceeds received in 2009 related to our disposition during 2008 of an interest in an unconsolidated real estate partnership and a $4.0 million gain from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization during 2009.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, gain on dispositions of unconsolidated real estate and other decreased $75.8 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a net gain of $98.4 million on our disposition in 2008 of interests in two unconsolidated real estate partnerships. This decrease was partially offset by $18.7 million of gains on the disposition of interests in unconsolidated partnerships during 2009. Gains recognized in 2009 consist of $8.6 million related to our receipt in 2009 of additional proceeds related to our disposition during 2008 of one of the partnership interests discussed above (see Note 3 to the consolidated financials statements in Item 8), $4.0 million from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), and $6.1 million from our disposition in 2009 of interests in several unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
 
Income Tax Benefit
Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, including property management, asset management and risk management are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and, as such, is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties. Income taxes related to the results of continuing operations of our TRS entities are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, income tax benefit increased by $0.8 million, from $17.5 million to $18.3 million. This increase in income tax benefit was primarily due to increased losses of our TRS entities, and was substantially offset by the $8.1 million tax benefit we recognized in 2009 related to the impairment of our investment in Casden Properties, LLC, for which no similar benefit was recognized in 2010.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, income tax benefit decreased by $39.1 million. This decrease was primarily attributed to $36.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2008 related to the impairments of our Lincoln Place property and our investment in Casden Properties LLC, both of which are owned through TRS entities, partially offset by $8.1 million of income tax benefit recognized in 2009 related to the impairment of our investment in Casden Properties LLC. The decrease in tax benefit from 2008 to 2009 related to these impairment losses was in addition to a decrease in tax benefit primarily due to larger losses by our TRS entities during 2008 as compared to 2009, including restructuring costs incurred in 2008 and a reduction in personnel and other costs in 2009 as a result of the organizational restructurings.
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net
The results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property-related revenues and operating expenses, depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale, property-specific interest expense and debt extinguishment gains and losses to the extent there is secured debt on the property. In addition, any impairment losses on assets held for sale and the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported in discontinued operations.
For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, income from discontinued operations totaled $75.8 million and $156.7 million, respectively. The $80.9 million decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $129.9 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to fewer properties sold in 2010 as compared to 2009, partially offset by a $21.2 million decrease in operating loss (inclusive of a $41.9 million decrease in real estate impairment losses) and a $34.3 million decrease in interest expense.
For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, income from discontinued operations totaled $156.7 million and $745.3 million, respectively. The $588.6 million decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally due to a $541.1 million decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate, net of income taxes, primarily attributable to fewer properties sold in 2009 as compared to 2008, and a $113.4 million decrease in operating income (inclusive of a $27.1 million increase in real estate impairment losses), partially offset by a $59.9 million decrease in interest expense and a $44.9 million increase in income tax benefit for 2009.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 51 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $401.4 million and net proceeds of $118.4 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $86.1 million (which is net of $8.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 89 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $1.3 billion and net proceeds of $432.7 million, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $216.0 million (which is net of $5.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 151 consolidated properties for gross proceeds of $2.4 billion and net proceeds of $1.1 billion, resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately $757.1 million (which is net of $43.1 million of related income taxes).
For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, income from discontinued operations includes the operating results of the properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2010.
Changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period. Additionally, gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction, and are not comparable period to period (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on discontinued operations).
 
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects the non-Aimco partners', or noncontrolling partners', share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships, as well as the noncontrolling partners' share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts that we charge to such partnerships. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 160, which are now codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification, or FASB ASC, Topic 810, effective January 1, 2009. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 160, we generally did not recognize a benefit for the noncontrolling interest partners' share of partnership losses for partnerships that have deficit noncontrolling interest balances and we generally recognized a charge to our earnings for distributions paid to noncontrolling partners for partnerships that had deficit noncontrolling interest balances. Under the updated provisions of FASB ASC Topic 810, we are required to attribute losses to noncontrolling interests even if such attribution would result in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance and we are no longer required to recognize a charge to our earnings for distributions paid to noncontrolling partners for partnerships that have deficit noncontrolling interest balances.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, we allocated net losses of $13.3 million to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships as compared to net income of $22.5 million allocated to these noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2009, a variance of $35.8 million. This change was substantially attributed to a decrease in the noncontrolling interest partners' share of income from discontinued operations, which decreased primarily due to a reduction in gains on the dispositions of real estate from 2009 to 2010.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, net earnings attributed to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased by $133.2 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of $108.7 million related to the noncontrolling interest partners' share of gains on dispositions of real estate, due primarily to fewer sales in 2009 as compared to 2008, $5.5 million of losses allocated to noncontrolling interests in 2009 that we would not have allocated to the noncontrolling interest partners in 2008 because to do so would have resulted in deficits in their noncontrolling interest balances, and approximately $3.8 million related to deficit distribution charges recognized as a reduction to our earnings in 2008, for which we did not recognize similar charges in 2009 based on the change in accounting discussed above. These decreases are in addition to the noncontrolling interest partners' share of increased losses of our consolidated real estate partnerships in 2009 as compared to 2008.
Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership
Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership consist of common partnership units and preferred OP Units held by limited partners in the Aimco Operating Partnership other than Aimco. We allocate the Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss to the holders of common partnership units based on the weighted average number of common partnership units (including those held by Aimco) outstanding during the period. Holders of the preferred OP Units participate in the Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss only to the extent of their preferred distributions.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, the effect on our earnings of income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership changed by $1.5 million. This change is primarily attributable to the $1.8 million excess of the carrying amount over the consideration paid in our repurchase of certain preferred OP Units during 2010, which is reflected as a reduction of income allocated to preferred noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, the effect on our earnings of income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership changed by $62.3 million. This change is attributable to a decrease of $50.8 million related to the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership's share of income from discontinued operations (net of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships), due primarily to larger gains on sales in 2008 relative to 2009 and $11.5 million in deficit distribution charges recognized during 2008 due to distributions in excess of the positive balance in noncontrolling interest. These changes were also affected by a decrease in the noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership's effective ownership interest from 2008 to 2009.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
From time to time, we have non-revenue producing properties that we hold for future redevelopment. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of these redevelopment properties by comparing our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows based on the expected service potential of the redevelopment property upon completion to the carrying amount. In certain instances, we use a probability-weighted approach to determine our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows when alternative courses of action are under consideration. As discussed in within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, during 2008 we recognized impairment losses on our Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas properties of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax) and $5.7 million, respectively.
Provision for Impairment Losses on Real Estate Development Assets
Real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. Several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments. These factors include:
Any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment of our long-lived assets, including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships. During 2011, we expect to market for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. For any properties that are sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during 2011, the reduction in the estimated holding period for these assets may result in additional impairment losses.
In addition to the impairments of Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas discussed above, based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded impairment losses of $0.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use, and during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded no additional impairments related to properties held for use. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized impairment losses of $12.7 million, $54.5 million and $27.4 million, respectively, for properties included in discontinued operations, primarily due to reductions in the estimated holding periods for assets sold during these periods.
 
Notes Receivable and Interest Income Recognition
Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and from non-affiliates represent our two portfolio segments, as defined in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-20, , that we use to evaluate for potential loan loss. Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner but do not consolidate the partnership. These loans are typically due on demand, have no stated maturity date and may not require current payments of principal or interest. Notes receivable from non-affiliates have stated maturity dates and may require current payments of principal and interest. Repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate properties and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders, which are generally senior to our claims. Our notes receivable consist of two classes: loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as "par value notes;" and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as "discounted notes."
Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses
We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income.
We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has closed or entered into certain pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method.
Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable
We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We update our cash flow projections of the borrowers annually, and more frequently for certain loans depending on facts and circumstances. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Factors that affect this assessment include the fair value of the partnership's real estate, pending transactions to refinance the partnership's senior obligations or sell the partnership's real estate, and market conditions (current and forecasted) related to a particular asset. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate.
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we recorded net provisions for losses on notes receivable of $0.9 million, $21.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively. As discussed in within the preceding discussion of our Results of Operations, provisions for losses on notes receivable in 2009 and 2008 include impairment losses of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) and $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax), respectively, on our investment in Casden Properties LLC, which we account for as a note receivable. We will continue to evaluate the collectibility of these notes, and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors.
Provision for Losses on Notes Receivable
Capitalized Costs
We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the property level. We characterize as "indirect costs" an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital additions activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses (see in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
Capital Additions and Related Depreciation
 
For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $11.6 million, $9.8 million and $25.7 million of interest costs, respectively, and $25.3 million, $40.0 million and $78.1 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively. The reductions from 2008 to 2010 are primarily due to a reduced level of redevelopment activities.
Funds From Operations
Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We compute FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT's April 1, 2002, White Paper, which we refer to as the White Paper. We calculate FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and premiums or discounts on preferred stock redemptions or repurchases. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although FFO is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of REITs, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing FFO is comparable with that of other REITs.
In addition to FFO, we compute an alternate measure of FFO, which we refer to as Pro forma FFO and which is FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding operating real estate impairments and preferred equity redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Both operating real estate impairment losses and preferred equity redemption related amounts are items that periodically affect our operating results. We exclude operating real estate impairment losses, net of related income tax benefits and noncontrolling interests, from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because we believe the inclusion of such losses in FFO is inconsistent with the treatment of gains on the disposition of operating real estate, which are not included in FFO. We exclude preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of our operating results. Similar to FFO, we believe Pro forma FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. Not all REITs present an alternate measure of FFO similar to our Pro forma FFO measure and there can be no assurance our basis for calculating Pro forma FFO is comparable to those of other REITs that do provide such a measure.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, our FFO and Pro forma FFO are calculated as follows (in thousands):
Notes:
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from property sales, proceeds from refinancings of existing property loans, borrowings under new property loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding property debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners and acquisitions of, and investments in, properties. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short-term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short-term liquidity demands, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings, to help us meet our short-term liquidity demands. We may use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and property acquisitions, through long-term borrowings, primarily secured, the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of properties and cash generated from operations.
The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels, many lenders have reentered the market, and the CMBS market is showing signs of recovery. However, any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We believe we mitigate this exposure through our continued focus on reducing our short and intermediate term maturity risk, by refinancing such loans with long-dated, fixed-rate property loans. If property financing options become unavailable for our debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in certain capital spending or proceeds from asset dispositions.
As further discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, we are subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate liabilities and preferred stock. At December 31, 2010, we estimate that a 1.0 % increase in 30-day LIBOR with constant credit risk spreads would reduce our net income (or increase our net loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders by approximately $3.9 million on an annual basis. The effect of an increase in 30-day LIBOR may be mitigated by the effect of our variable rate assets.
As further discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we use total rate of return swaps as a financing product to lower our cost of borrowing through conversion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rates. The cost of financing through these arrangements is generally lower than the fixed rate on the debt. As of December 31, 2010, we had total rate of return swap positions with two financial institutions with notional amounts totaling $277.3 million. Swaps with notional amounts of $248.1 million and $29.2 million had maturity dates in May 2012 and October 2012, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received net cash receipts of $20.9 million under the total return swaps, which positively affected our liquidity. To the extent interest rates increase above the fixed rates on the underlying borrowings, our obligations under the total return swaps will negatively affect our liquidity.
 
During 2010, we refinanced certain of the underlying borrowings subject to total rate of return swaps with long-dated, fixed-rate property debt, and we expect to do the same with certain of the underlying borrowings in 2011. The average effective interest rate associated with our borrowings subject to the total rate of return swaps was 1.6% at December 31, 2010. To the extent we are successful in refinancing additional of the borrowings subject to the total rate of return swaps during 2011, we anticipate the interest cost associated with these borrowings will increase, which would negatively affect our liquidity.
We periodically evaluate counterparty credit risk associated with these arrangements. In the event a counterparty were to default under these arrangements, loss of the net interest benefit we generally receive under these arrangements, which is equal to the difference between the fixed rate we receive and the variable rate we pay, may adversely affect our liquidity. However, at the current time, we have concluded we do not have material exposure.
The total rate of return swaps require specified loan-to-value ratios. In the event the values of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements decline or if we sell properties in the collateral pool with low loan-to-value ratios, certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have an obligation to pay down the debt or provide additional collateral pursuant to the swap agreements, which may adversely affect our cash flows. The obligation to provide collateral is limited to these subsidiaries and is non-recourse to us. At December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries were not required to provide cash collateral based on the loan-to-value ratios of the real estate properties serving as collateral under these agreements.
See in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding these arrangements, including the current swap maturity dates and disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
Derivative Financial Instruments
As of December 31, 2010, we had the capacity to borrow $260.3 million pursuant to our $300.0 million revolving credit facility (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit).
At December 31, 2010, we had $111.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $30.1 million from December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we had $201.1 million of restricted cash, a decrease of $17.3 million from December 31, 2009. Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital additions, property taxes and insurance. In addition, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8.
Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by operating activities of $257.5 million was primarily related to operating income from our consolidated properties, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties, in excess of payments of operating accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including amounts related to our organizational restructuring. Cash provided by operating activities increased $23.7 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to decreases in interest paid and other working capital expenditures, including payments related to our restructuring accruals, in 2010 as compared to 2009, partially offset by a decrease in property net operating income, primarily due to property sales during 2009 and 2010.
Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2010, our net cash provided by investing activities of $86.4 million consisted primarily of proceeds from disposition of real estate and partnership interests, partially offset by capital expenditures.
Although we hold all of our properties for investment, we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 51 consolidated properties. These properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of $402.5 million, generating proceeds totaling $387.9 million after the payment of transaction costs and debt prepayment penalties. The $387.9 million is inclusive of debt assumed by buyers. Net cash proceeds from property sales were used primarily to repay or pay down property debt and for other corporate purposes.
 
Capital expenditures totaled $178.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, and consisted primarily of Capital Improvements and Capital Replacements, and to a lesser extent included spending for redevelopment projects and casualties. In 2011, we expect to increase our redevelopment spending on conventional properties from approximately $30.0 million in 2010 to approximately $50.0 million to $75.0 million. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities, working capital and property sales.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in financing activities of $313.8 million was primarily attributed to debt principal payments, dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders, distributions to noncontrolling interests and our redemption and repurchase of preferred stock. Proceeds from property loans and our issuance of preferred stock partially offset the cash outflows.
Property Debt
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, in consolidated property debt outstanding, which included $27.3 million and $264.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of property debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we refinanced or closed property loans on 23 properties generating $449.4 million of proceeds from borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.42%. Our share of the net proceeds after repayment of existing debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners, was $138.9 million. We used these total net proceeds for capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. We intend to continue to refinance property debt primarily as a means of extending current and near term maturities and to finance certain capital projects.
Credit Facility
We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. During 2010, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the revolving commitments from $180.0 million to $300.0 million, extend the maturity from May 2012 to May 2014 (both inclusive of a one year extension option) and reduce the LIBOR floor on the facility's base interest rate from 2.00% to 1.50%. During 2010, we also repaid in full the remaining $90.0 million term loan that was outstanding as of December 31, 2009.
As of December 31, 2010, the Credit Agreement consisted of $300.0 million of revolving loan commitments. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (either at LIBOR plus 4.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.50% or, at our option, a base rate equal to the prime rate plus a spread of 3.00%). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2013, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 35.0 basis point fee on the total revolving commitments.
At December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The amount available under the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2010, was $260.3 million (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility). The proceeds of revolving loans are generally used to fund working capital and for other corporate purposes.
Our Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy covenant ratios of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt service and earnings to fixed charges of 1.40:1 and 1.20:1, respectively. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, as calculated based on the provisions in our Credit Agreement, we had a ratio of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt service of 1.57:1 and a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of 1.33:1. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants during 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, the covenant ratios of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization to debt service and earnings to fixed charges required by our Credit Agreement will increase to 1.50:1 and 1.30:1, respectively.
 
Equity Transactions
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid cash dividends or distributions totaling $53.4 million, $46.7 million and $10.1 million to preferred stockholders, common stockholders and noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 4,000,000 shares of our 7.75% Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $96.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction expenses of $3.3 million), and we sold 600,000 shares of our Common Stock pursuant to an At-The-Market, or ATM, offering program we initiated during 2010, generating $14.4 million of net proceeds. Aimco used the proceeds from the Common Stock issuance primarily to fund the acquisition of noncontrolling limited partnership interests for certain consolidated real estate partnerships.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 20 shares, or $10.0 million in liquidation preference, of CRA Preferred Stock for $7.0 million, and primarily using the proceeds from our issuance of preferred stock discussed above, we redeemed the 4,040,000 outstanding shares of our 9.375% Class G Cumulative Preferred Stock for $101.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends of $2.2 million.
Pursuant to the ATM offering program discussed above, we may issue up to 6.4 million additional shares of our Common Stock. Additionally, we and the Aimco Operating Partnership have a shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid cash distributions of $44.5 million to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships, primarily related to property sales during 2010 and late 2009.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling limited partnership interests in two consolidated partnerships, in which our affiliates serve as general partner, for total consideration of $19.9 million. This consideration consisted of $12.5 million in cash, $6.9 million in common OP Units and $0.5 million of other consideration.
Contractual Obligations
This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 (amounts in thousands):
In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, at December 31, 2010, we had $679.5 million (liquidation value) of perpetual preferred stock outstanding with annual dividend yields ranging from 1.5% (variable) to 8.0%, and $82.6 million (liquidation value) of redeemable preferred units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding with annual distribution yields ranging from 1.8% to 8.8%, or equal to the dividends paid on Common Stock based on the conversion terms. As further discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have a potential obligation to repurchase $20.0 million in liquidation preference our Series A Community Reinvestment Act Preferred Stock over the next two years for $14.0 million.
 
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we have notes receivable collateralized by second mortgages on certain properties in West Harlem in New York City. In certain circumstances, the obligor under these notes has the ability to put properties to us, which would result in a cash payment of approximately $30.6 million and the assumption of approximately $118.6 million in property debt. The obligor's right to exercise the put is dependent upon the achievement of specified operating performance thresholds.
Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
Future Capital Needs
In addition to the items set forth in "Contractual Obligations" above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment projects, Capital Improvements and Capital Replacements principally with proceeds from property sales (including tax-free exchange proceeds), short-term borrowings, debt and equity financing (including tax credit equity) and operating cash flows.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships, in which our total ownership interests typically range from less than 1% to 50% and in some instances may exceed 50%. There are no lines of credit, side agreements, or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees. Accordingly, our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes or accounts receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements (see Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships).

Stockholders and Board of Directors Apartment Investment and Management Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company") as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying Index to Financial Statements. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update 2009-17, , and during 2009 adopted FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, (codified in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810). Further, as discussed in Note 13, the company retrospectively adjusted the consolidated financial statements to reflect real estate assets that meet the definition of a component and have been sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010, pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 360, through March 31, 2011.

NOTE 1  Organization
Apartment Investment and Management Company, or Aimco, is a Maryland corporation incorporated on January 10, 1994. We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our stockholders. Our business plan to achieve this objective is to:
As of December 31, 2010, we:
Of these properties, we consolidated 217 conventional properties with 67,668 units and 182 affordable properties with 22,207 units. These conventional and affordable properties generated 88% and 12%, respectively, of our proportionate property net operating income (as defined in Note 17) during the year ended December 31, 2010. Any reference to the number of properties or units is unaudited.
For conventional assets, we focus on the ownership of primarily B/B+ assets. We measure conventional property asset quality based on average rents of our units compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis, with A-quality assets earning rents greater than 125% of local market average, B-quality assets earning rents 90% to 125% of local market average and C-quality assets earning rents less than 90% of local market average. We classify as B/B+ those assets earning rents ranging from 100% to 125% of local market average. Although some companies and analysts within the multifamily real estate industry use asset class ratings of A, B and C, some of which are tied to local market rent averages, the metrics used to classify asset quality as well as the timing for which local markets rents are calculated may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our rating system for measuring asset quality is neither broadly nor consistently used in the multifamily real estate industry.
Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AIMCO-GP, Inc. and AIMCO-LP Trust, we own a majority of the ownership interests in AIMCO Properties, L.P., which we refer to as the Aimco Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2010, we held an interest of approximately 93% in the common partnership units and equivalents of the Aimco Operating Partnership. We conduct substantially all of our business and own substantially all of our assets through the Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are referred to as "OP Units." OP Units include common partnership units, high performance partnership units and partnership preferred units, which we refer to as common OP Units, High Performance Units and preferred OP Units, respectively. At December 31, 2010, 117,642,872 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding and the Aimco Operating Partnership had 8,470,013 common partnership units and equivalents outstanding for a combined total of 126,112,885 shares of Common Stock, common partnership units and equivalents outstanding.
Except as the context otherwise requires, "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and their consolidated entities, collectively.
NOTE 2  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership, and their consolidated entities. We consolidate all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, we consolidate real estate partnerships and other entities that are not variable interest entities when we own, directly or indirectly, a majority voting interest in the entity or are otherwise able to control the entity. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by limited partners other than Aimco are reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership. Interests in partnerships consolidated into the Aimco Operating Partnership that are held by third parties are reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. The assets of consolidated real estate partnerships owned or controlled by us generally are not available to pay creditors of Aimco or the Aimco Operating Partnership.
As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "partnership" refers to a limited partnership or a limited liability company and "partner" refers to a partner in a limited partnership or a member in a limited liability company.
Variable Interest Entities
We consolidate all variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, a variable interest entity, or VIE, is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Update 2009-17, or ASU 2009-17, on a prospective basis. ASU 2009-17, which modified the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 810, introduced a more qualitative approach to evaluating VIEs for consolidation and requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity that has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's performance, ASU 2009-17 requires a company to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a VIE operates as designed, requires continuous reassessment of primary beneficiary status rather than periodic, event-driven assessments as previously required, and incorporates expanded disclosure requirements.
Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities,
In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions.
 
As a result of our adoption of ASU 2009-17, we concluded we are the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidated, 49 previously unconsolidated partnerships. Those partnerships own, or control other entities that own, 31 apartment properties. Our direct and indirect interests in the profits and losses of those partnerships range from less than 1% to 35%, and average approximately 7%. We applied the practicability exception for initial measurement of consolidated VIEs to partnerships that own 13 properties and accordingly recognized the consolidated assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value effective January 1, 2010 (refer to the Fair Value Measurements section for further information regarding certain of the fair value amounts recognized upon consolidation). We deconsolidated partnerships that own ten apartment properties in which we hold an average interest of approximately 55%. The initial consolidation and deconsolidation of these partnerships resulted in increases (decreases), net of intercompany eliminations, in amounts included in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2010, as follows (in thousands):
In periods prior to 2009, when consolidated real estate partnerships made cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest, we generally recorded a charge to earnings equal to the amount of such excess distribution, even though there was no economic effect or cost. Also prior to 2009, we allocated the noncontrolling partners' share of partnership losses to noncontrolling partners to the extent of the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest. Consolidation of a partnership does not ordinarily result in a change to the net amount of partnership income or loss that is recognized using the equity method. However, prior to 2009, when a partnership had a deficit in equity, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, may have required the controlling partner that consolidates the partnership to recognize any losses that would otherwise be allocated to noncontrolling partners, in addition to the controlling partner's share of losses. Certain of the partnerships that we consolidated in accordance with ASU 2009-17 had deficits in equity that resulted from losses or deficit distributions during prior periods when we accounted for our investment using the equity method. We would have been required to recognize the noncontrolling partners' share of those losses had we consolidated those partnerships in those periods prior to 2009. In accordance with our prospective transition method for the adoption of ASU 2009-17 related to our consolidation of previously unconsolidated partnerships, we recorded a $30.7 million charge to our equity, the majority of which was attributed to the cumulative amount of additional losses that we would have recognized had we applied ASU 2009-17 in periods prior to 2009. Substantially all of those losses were attributable to real estate depreciation expense.
Our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010, include the following amounts for the entities and related real estate properties consolidated as of January 1, 2010 (for both continuing and discontinued operations), in accordance with ASU 2009-17 (in thousands):
Our equity in the results of operations of the partnerships and related properties we deconsolidated in connection with our adoption of ASU 2009-17 is included in equity in earnings or losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. The amounts related to these entities are not significant.
 
As of December 31, 2010, we were the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidated, approximately 137 VIEs, which owned 96 apartment properties with 14,054 units (inclusive of properties sold or classified as held for sale through March 31, 2011). Real estate with a carrying value of $867.1 million collateralized $654.3 million of debt of those VIEs. Any significant amounts of assets and liabilities related to our consolidated VIEs are identified parenthetically on our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The creditors of the consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to our general credit.
As of December 31, 2010, we also held variable interests in 276 VIEs for which we were not the primary beneficiary. Those VIEs consist primarily of partnerships that are engaged, directly or indirectly, in the ownership and management of 329 apartment properties with 20,570 units. We are involved with those VIEs as an equity holder, lender, management agent, or through other contractual relationships. The majority of our investments in unconsolidated VIEs, or approximately $48.9 million at December 31, 2010, are held through consolidated investment partnerships that are VIEs and in which we generally hold a 1% or less general partner or equivalent interest. Accordingly, substantially all of the investment balances related to these unconsolidated VIEs are attributed to the noncontrolling interests in the consolidated investment partnerships that hold the investments in these unconsolidated VIEs. Our maximum risk of loss related to our investment in these VIEs is generally limited to our equity interest in the consolidated investment partnerships, which is insignificant. The remainder of our investment in unconsolidated VIEs, or approximately $5.5 million at December 31, 2010, is held through consolidated investment partnerships that are VIEs and in which we hold substantially all of the economic interests. Our maximum risk of loss related to our investment in these VIEs is limited to our $5.5 million recorded investment in such entities.
In addition to our investments in unconsolidated VIEs discussed above, at December 31, 2010, we had in aggregate $101.7 million of receivables from unconsolidated VIEs and we had a contractual obligation to advance funds to certain unconsolidated VIEs totaling $3.8 million. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our lending and management activities related to these unconsolidated VIEs is limited to these amounts. We may be subject to additional losses to the extent of any receivables relating to future provision of services to these entities or financial support that we voluntarily provide.
Acquisition of Real Estate Assets and Related Depreciation and Amortization
We adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), , or SFAS 141(R), which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 805, effective January 1, 2009. These provisions apply to all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses, including those effected without the transfer of consideration, for example, by contract or through a lapse of minority veto rights. These provisions require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establish the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and require expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs.
Business Combinations  a replacement of FASB Statement No. 141
We believe most operating real estate assets meet SFAS 141(R)'s revised definition of a business. Accordingly, in connection with our 2009 adoption of SFAS 141(R), we retroactively adjusted our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, to expense $3.5 million of transaction costs incurred prior to December 31, 2008. This retroactive adjustment is reflected in investment management expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations and reduced basic and diluted earnings per share amounts by $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Effective January 1, 2009, we recognize at fair value the acquisition of properties or interests in partnerships that own properties if the transaction results in consolidation and we expense as incurred most related transaction costs. We allocate the cost of acquired properties to tangible assets and identified intangible assets based on their fair values. We determine the fair value of tangible assets, such as land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, generally using internal valuation techniques that consider comparable market transactions, discounted cash flow techniques, replacement costs and other available information. We determine the fair value of identified intangible assets (or liabilities), which typically relate to in-place leases, using internal valuation techniques that consider the terms of the in-place leases, current market data for comparable leases, and our experience in leasing similar properties. The intangible assets or liabilities related to in-place leases are comprised of:
 
The values of the above- and below-market leases are amortized to rental revenue over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases which include reasonably assured renewal periods. Other intangible assets related to in-place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization over the expected remaining terms of the associated leases. Amortization is adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any early lease terminations that were not anticipated in determining amortization periods.
Depreciation for all tangible real estate assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Acquired buildings and improvements are depreciated over a composite life of 14 to 52 years, based on the age, condition and other physical characteristics of the property. As discussed under below, we may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or demolished prior to the end of their useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment associated with acquired properties are depreciated over five years.
Impairment of Long Lived Assets
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, deferred income in our consolidated balance sheets includes below-market lease amounts totaling $27.9 million and $31.8 million, respectively, which are net of accumulated amortization of $24.9 million and $21.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we included amortization of below-market leases of $3.9 million, $4.4 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in rental and other property revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2010, our below-market leases had a weighted average amortization period of 7.0 years and estimated aggregate amortization for each of the five succeeding years as follows (in millions):
Capital Additions and Related Depreciation
We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopment and construction projects, other tangible property improvements, and replacements of existing property components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the property level. We characterize as "indirect costs" an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress. We charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities, including ordinary repairs, maintenance, resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses.
We depreciate capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related component or improvement, which is generally five, 15 or 30 years. All capitalized site payroll and indirect costs are allocated proportionately, based on direct costs, among capital projects and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of such projects.
Certain homogeneous items that are purchased in bulk on a recurring basis, such as carpeting and appliances, are depreciated using group methods that reflect the average estimated useful life of the items in each group. Except in the case of property casualties, where the net book value of lost property is written off in the determination of casualty gains or losses, we generally do not recognize any loss in connection with the replacement of an existing property component because normal replacements are considered in determining the estimated useful lives used in connection with our composite and group depreciation methods.
For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, for continuing and discontinued operations, we capitalized $11.6 million, $9.8 million and $25.7 million of interest costs, respectively, and $25.3 million, $40.0 million and $78.1 million of site payroll and indirect costs, respectively.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the property. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
In connection with the preparation of our 2008 annual financial statements, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in our Lincoln Place property, located in Venice, California. Based upon the declines in land values in Southern California during 2008 and the expected timing of our redevelopment efforts, we determined that the total carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, recognized an impairment loss of $85.4 million ($55.6 million net of tax).
Similarly, we assessed the recoverability of our investment in Pacific Bay Vistas (formerly Treetops), a vacant property located in San Bruno, California, and determined that the carrying amount of the property was no longer probable of full recovery and, accordingly, we recognized an impairment loss of $5.7 million for this property during the three months ended December 31, 2008.
In addition to the impairments of Lincoln Place and Pacific Bay Vistas, based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded real estate impairment losses of $0.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to properties classified as held for use. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded no similar impairment losses related to properties classified as held for use.
We report impairment losses or recoveries related to properties sold or classified as held for sale in discontinued operations.
Our tests of recoverability address real estate assets that do not currently meet all conditions to be classified as held for sale, but are expected to be disposed of prior to the end of their estimated useful lives. If an impairment loss is not required to be recorded, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We also may adjust depreciation prospectively to reduce to zero the carrying amount of buildings that we plan to demolish in connection with a redevelopment project. These depreciation adjustments, after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, decreased net income available to Aimco common stockholders by $0.2 million, $18.3 million and $10.7 million, and resulted in decreases in basic and diluted earnings per share of less than $0.01, $0.16 and $0.12, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Cash Equivalents
We classify highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes capital replacement reserves, completion repair reserves, bond sinking fund amounts and tax and insurance escrow accounts held by lenders.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable are generally comprised of amounts receivable from residents, amounts receivable from non-affiliated real estate partnerships for which we provide property management and other services and other miscellaneous receivables from non-affiliated entities. We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable from residents and establish an allowance, after the application of security deposits and other anticipated recoveries, for accounts greater than 30 days past due for current residents and all receivables due from former residents. Accounts receivable from residents are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $2.1 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable from non-affiliated entities and establish an allowance for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable relating to non-affiliated entities are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.0 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts from Affiliates
Accounts receivable from affiliates are generally comprised of receivables related to property management and other services provided to unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which we have an ownership interest. We evaluate collectibility of accounts receivable balances from affiliates on a periodic basis, and establish an allowance for the amounts deemed to be uncollectible. Accounts receivable from affiliates are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.5 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Deferred Costs
We defer lender fees and other direct costs incurred in obtaining new financing and amortize the amounts over the terms of the related loan agreements. Amortization of these costs is included in interest expense.
We defer leasing commissions and other direct costs incurred in connection with successful leasing efforts and amortize the costs over the terms of the related leases. Amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization.
Notes Receivable from Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships and Non-Affiliates and Related Interest Income and Provision for Losses
Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and from non-affiliates represent our two portfolio segments, as defined in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2010-20, , that we use to evaluate for potential loan loss. Notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner but do not consolidate the partnership. These loans are typically due on demand, have no stated maturity date and may not require current payments of principal or interest. Notes receivable from non-affiliates have stated maturity dates and may require current payments of principal and interest. Repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables, including the performance and value of the underlying real estate properties and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders, which are generally senior to our claims. Our notes receivable consist of two classes: loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest, which we refer to as "par value notes;" and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount, which we refer to as "discounted notes."
Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses
We record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements. We discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired, as discussed below, or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest. We record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method, under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan; thereafter, any additional receipts are recognized as income.
We recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable. We consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has closed or entered into certain pending transactions (which include real estate sales, refinancings, foreclosures and rights offerings) that provide a reliable source of repayment. In such instances, we recognize accretion income, on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value. We record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method.
We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We update our cash flow projections of the borrowers annually, and more frequently for certain loans depending on facts and circumstances. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Factors that affect this assessment include the fair value of the partnership's real estate, pending transactions to refinance the partnership's senior obligations or sell the partnership's real estate, and market conditions (current and forecasted) related to a particular asset. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. In certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan, the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan's original effective interest rate. See Note 5 for further discussion of our notes receivable.
 
Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
We own general and limited partner interests in partnerships that either directly, or through interests in other real estate partnerships, own apartment properties. We generally account for investments in real estate partnerships that we do not consolidate under the equity method. Under the equity method, our share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented is included in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated real estate partnerships, inclusive of our share of impairments and property disposition gains recognized by and related to such entities. Certain investments in real estate partnerships that were acquired in business combinations were determined to have insignificant value at the acquisition date and are accounted for under the cost method. Any distributions received from such partnerships are recognized as income when received.
The excess of the cost of the acquired partnership interests over the historical carrying amount of partners' equity or deficit is ascribed generally to the fair values of land and buildings owned by the partnerships. We amortize the excess cost related to the buildings over the estimated useful lives of the buildings. Such amortization is recorded as a component of equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated real estate partnerships. See Note 4 for further discussion of Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships.
Intangible Assets
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, other assets included goodwill associated with our reportable segments of $67.1 million and $71.8 million, respectively. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill that compares the fair value of reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. We determined that our goodwill was not impaired in 2010, 2009 or 2008.
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we allocated $4.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively, of goodwill related to our reportable segments (conventional and affordable real estate operations) to the carrying amounts of the properties sold or classified as held for sale during those periods. The amounts of goodwill allocated to these properties were based on the relative fair values of the properties sold or classified as held for sale and the retained portions of the reporting units to which the goodwill as allocated. During 2008, we did not allocate any goodwill to properties sold or classified as held for sale as real estate properties were not considered businesses under then applicable GAAP.
Other assets also includes intangible assets for purchased management contracts with finite lives that we amortize on a straight-line basis over terms ranging from five to 20 years and intangible assets for in-place leases as discussed under
Acquisition of Real Estate Assets and Related Depreciation and Amortization.
Capitalized Software Costs
Purchased software and other costs related to software developed for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally five years. We write-off the costs of software development projects when it is no longer probable that the software will be completed and placed in service. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we capitalized software development costs totaling $8.7 million, $5.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, other assets included $28.1 million and $29.7 million of net capitalized software, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized amortization of capitalized software of $10.2 million, $11.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we reassessed our approach to communication technology needs at our properties, which resulted in the discontinuation of an infrastructure project and a $5.4 million write-off of related hardware and capitalized internal and consulting costs included in other assets. The write-off, which is net of sales proceeds, is included in other expenses, net. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we additionally recorded a $1.6 million write-off of certain software and hardware assets that are no longer consistent with our information technology strategy. This write-off is included in depreciation and amortization. There were no similar write-offs during the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.
 
Noncontrolling Interests
Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, , or SFAS 160, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 810. These provisions clarified that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in a consolidated entity, which should be reported as equity in the parent's consolidated financial statements. These provisions require disclosure, on the face of the consolidated statements of operations, of the amounts of consolidated net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests, eliminating the past practice of reporting amounts of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as an adjustment in arriving at consolidated net income. These provisions also require us to attribute to noncontrolling interests their share of losses even if such attribution results in a deficit noncontrolling interest balance within our equity accounts, and in some instances, recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements  an amendment of ARB No. 51
In connection with our retrospective application of these provisions, we reclassified into our consolidated equity accounts the historical balances related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and the portion of noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership related to the Aimco Operating Partnership's common OP Units and High Performance Units. At December 31, 2008, the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships was $380.7 million and the carrying amount for noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership attributable to common OP Units and High Performance Units was zero, due to cash distributions in excess of the positive balances related to those noncontrolling interests.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
We report the unaffiliated partners' interests in our consolidated real estate partnerships as noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships represent the noncontrolling partners' share of the underlying net assets of our consolidated real estate partnerships. Prior to 2009, when these consolidated real estate partnerships made cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest, we generally recorded a charge equal to the amount of such excess distribution, even though there was no economic effect or cost. These charges are reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, within noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Also prior to 2009, we allocated the noncontrolling partners' share of partnership losses to noncontrolling partners to the extent of the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest. We generally recorded a charge when the noncontrolling partners' share of partnership losses exceeds the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest, even though there is no economic effect or cost. These charges are reported in the consolidated statements of operations within noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. We did not record charges for distributions or losses in certain limited instances where the noncontrolling partner had a legal obligation and financial capacity to contribute additional capital to the partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded charges for partnership losses resulting from depreciation of approximately $9.0 million that were not allocated to noncontrolling partners because the losses exceeded the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest.
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of equity interests held by limited partners in consolidated real estate partnerships that have finite lives. The terms of the related partnership agreements generally require the partnership to be liquidated following the sale of the partnership's real estate. As the general partner in these partnerships, we ordinarily control the execution of real estate sales and other events that could lead to the liquidation, redemption or other settlement of noncontrolling interests. The aggregate carrying amount of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships is approximately $291.5 million at December 31, 2010. The aggregate fair value of these interests varies based on the fair value of the real estate owned by the partnerships. Based on the number of classes of finite-life noncontrolling interests, the number of properties in which there is direct or indirect noncontrolling ownership, complexities in determining the allocation of liquidation proceeds among partners and other factors, we believe it is impracticable to determine the total required payments to the noncontrolling interests in an assumed liquidation at December 31, 2010. As a result of real estate depreciation that is recognized in our financial statements and appreciation in the fair value of real estate that is not recognized in our financial statements, we believe that the aggregate fair value of our noncontrolling interests exceeds their aggregate carrying amount. As a result of our ability to control real estate sales and other events that require payment of noncontrolling interests and our expectation that proceeds from real estate sales will be sufficient to liquidate related noncontrolling interests, we anticipate that the eventual liquidation of these noncontrolling interests will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
Changes in our ownership interest in consolidated real estate partnerships generally consist of our purchase of an additional interest in or the sale of our entire interest in a consolidated real estate partnership. The effect on our equity of our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2010 is shown in the consolidated statement of equity and further discussed in Note 3. Our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships had no significant effect on our equity during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The effect on our equity of sales of our entire interest in consolidated real estate partnerships is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as sales of real estate and accordingly the effect on our equity is reflected as gains on disposition of real estate, less the amounts of such gains attributable to noncontrolling interests, within consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Aimco common stockholders.
 
Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership
Noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership consist of common OP Units, High Performance Units and preferred OP Units held by limited partners in the Aimco Operating Partnership other than Aimco. We allocate the Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss to the holders of common OP Units and High Performance Units based on the weighted average number of common partnership units (including those held by us) and High Performance Units outstanding during the period. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the holders of common OP Units and equivalents had a weighted average ownership interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership of was approximately 7%, 7% and 10%, respectively. Holders of the preferred OP Units participate in the Aimco Operating Partnership's income or loss only to the extent of their preferred distributions. See Note 10 for further information regarding noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership.
Revenue Recognition
Our properties have operating leases with apartment residents with terms averaging 12 months. We recognize rental revenue related to these leases, net of any concessions, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We recognize revenues from property management, asset management, syndication and other services when the related fees are earned and are realized or realizable.
Advertising Costs
We generally expense all advertising costs as incurred to property operating expense. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, for both continuing and discontinued operations, total advertising expense was $14.2 million, $21.7 million and $31.8 million, respectively.
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverages insure our properties adequately against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, and other perils. In addition, we have insurance coverage for substantial portions of our property, workers' compensation, health, and general liability exposures. Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience.
Stock-Based Compensation
We recognize all stock-based employee compensation, including grants of employee stock options, in the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value and recognize compensation cost, which is net of estimates for expected forfeitures, ratably over the awards' requisite service period. See Note 12 for further discussion of our stock-based compensation.
Tax Credit Arrangements
We sponsor certain partnerships that own and operate apartment properties that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, and for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, subsidized rents under HUD's Section 8 program. These partnerships acquire, develop and operate qualifying affordable housing properties and are structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and deductions to their partners. The tax credits are generally realized ratably over the first ten years of the tax credit arrangement and are subject to the partnership's compliance with applicable laws and regulations for a period of 15 years. Typically, we are the general partner with a legal ownership interest of one percent or less. We market limited partner interests of at least 99 percent to unaffiliated institutional investors (which we refer to as tax credit investors or investors) and receive a syndication fee from each investor upon such investor's admission to the partnership. At inception, each investor agrees to fund capital contributions to the partnerships. We agree to perform various services for the partnerships in exchange for fees over the expected duration of the tax credit service period. The related partnership agreements generally require adjustment of each tax credit investor's required capital contributions if actual tax benefits to such investor differ from projected amounts.
 
We have determined that the partnerships in these arrangements are variable interest entities and, where we are general partner, we are generally the primary beneficiary that is required to consolidate the partnerships. When the contractual arrangements obligate us to deliver tax benefits to the investors, and entitle us through fee arrangements to receive substantially all available cash flow from the partnerships, we account for these partnerships as wholly owned subsidiaries. Capital contributions received by the partnerships from tax credit investors represent, in substance, consideration that we receive in exchange for our obligation to deliver tax credits and other tax benefits to the investors, and the receipts are recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements when our obligation to the investors is relieved upon delivery of the expected tax benefits.
In summary, our accounting treatment recognizes the income or loss generated by the underlying real estate based on our economic interest in the partnerships. Proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of the tax credits are recognized as revenue proportionately as the tax benefits are delivered to the tax credit investors and our obligation is relieved. Syndication fees and related costs are recognized in income upon completion of the syndication effort. We recognize syndication fees in amounts determined based on a market rate analysis of fees for comparable services, which generally fell within a range of 10% to 15% of investor contributions during the periods presented. Other direct and incremental costs incurred in structuring these arrangements are deferred and amortized over the expected duration of the arrangement in proportion to the recognition of related income. Investor contributions in excess of recognized revenue are reported as deferred income in our consolidated balance sheets.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a net $1.0 million reduction of syndication fees due to our determination that certain syndication fees receivable were uncollectible. We recognized no syndication fee income during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized syndication fee income of $3.4 million. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we recognized revenue associated with the delivery of tax benefits of $28.9 million, $36.6 million and $29.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $114.7 million and $148.1 million, respectively, of investor contributions in excess of the recognized revenue were included in deferred income in our consolidated balance sheets.
Discontinued Operations
We classify certain properties and related assets and liabilities as held for sale when they meet certain criteria. The operating results of such properties as well as those properties sold during the periods presented are included in discontinued operations in both current periods and all comparable periods presented. Depreciation is not recorded on properties once they have been classified as held for sale; however, depreciation expense recorded prior to classification as held for sale is included in discontinued operations. The net gain on sale and any impairment losses are presented in discontinued operations when recognized. See Note 13 for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We primarily use long-term, fixed-rate and self-amortizing non-recourse debt to avoid, among other things, risk related to fluctuating interest rates. For our variable rate debt, we are sometimes required by our lenders to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering into interest rate swap or cap agreements. The interest rate swap agreements moderate our exposure to interest rate risk by effectively converting the interest on variable rate debt to a fixed rate. The interest rate cap agreements effectively limit our exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are reflected as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, and periodic changes in fair value are included in interest expense or equity, as appropriate. The interest rate caps are not material to our financial position or results of operations.
As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of $52.3 million, and recorded fair values of $2.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, reflected in accrued liabilities and other in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2010, these interest rate swaps had a weighted average term of 10.1 years. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and recognize any changes in their fair value as an adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity to the extent of their effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of these instruments and the related amounts of such changes that were reflected as an adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity and as an adjustment of earnings (ineffectiveness) are discussed in the foregoing Fair Value Measurements section.
 
If the forward rates at December 31, 2010 remain constant, we estimate that during the next twelve months, we would reclassify into earnings approximately $1.6 million of the unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If market interest rates increase above the 3.43% weighted average fixed rate under these interest rate swaps we will benefit from net cash payments due to us from our counterparty to the interest rate swaps.
We have entered into total rate of return swaps on various fixed-rate secured tax-exempt bonds payable and fixed-rate notes payable to convert these borrowings from a fixed rate to a variable rate and provide an efficient financing product to lower our cost of borrowing. In exchange for our receipt of a fixed rate generally equal to the underlying borrowing's interest rate, the total rate of return swaps require that we pay a variable rate, equivalent to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Municipal Swap Index, or SIFMA, rate for tax-exempt bonds payable and the 30-day LIBOR rate for notes payable, plus a risk spread. These swaps generally have a second or third lien on the property collateralized by the related borrowings and the obligations under certain of these swaps are cross-collateralized with certain of the other swaps with a particular counterparty. The underlying borrowings are generally callable at our option, with no prepayment penalty, with 30 days advance notice, and the swaps generally have a term of less than five years. The total rate of return swaps have a contractually defined termination value generally equal to the difference between the fair value and the counterparty's purchased value of the underlying borrowings, which may require payment by us or to us for such difference. Accordingly, we believe fluctuations in the fair value of the borrowings from the inception of the hedging relationship generally will be offset by a corresponding fluctuation in the fair value of the total rate of return swaps.
We designate total rate of return swaps as hedges of the risk of overall changes in the fair value of the underlying borrowings. At each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of these borrowings and the total rate of return swaps and recognize any changes therein as an adjustment of interest expense. We evaluate the effectiveness of these fair value hedges at the end of each reporting period and recognize an adjustment of interest expense as a result of any ineffectiveness.
Borrowings payable subject to total rate of return swaps with aggregate outstanding principal balances of $276.9 million and $352.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are reflected as variable rate borrowings in Note 6. Due to changes in the estimated fair values of these debt instruments and the corresponding total rate of return swaps, we increased the carrying amount of property loans payable by $4.8 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and reduced the carrying amount of property loans payable by $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, with offsetting adjustments to the swap values in accrued liabilities, resulting in no net effect on net income. Refer to the foregoing Fair Value Measurements section for further discussion of fair value measurements related to these arrangements. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we determined these hedges were fully effective and accordingly we made no adjustments to interest expense for ineffectiveness.
At December 31, 2010, the weighted average fixed receive rate under the total return swaps was 6.8% and the weighted average variable pay rate was 1.6%, based on the applicable SIFMA and 30-day LIBOR rates effective as of that date. Further information related to our total return swaps as of December 31, 2010 is as follows (dollars in millions):
 
Fair Value Measurements
Beginning in 2008, we applied the FASB's revised accounting provisions related to fair value measurements, which are codified in FASB ASC Topic 820. These revised provisions define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, establish a hierarchy that prioritizes the information used in developing fair value estimates and require disclosure of fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3 measurements), such as the reporting entity's own data. We adopted the revised fair value measurement provisions that apply to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2008, and the provisions that apply to the remaining fair value measurements effective January 1, 2009, and at those times determined no transition adjustments were required.
The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and includes three levels defined as follows:
A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used for our significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Although some of the valuation methodologies use observable market inputs in limited instances, the majority of inputs we use are unobservable and are therefore classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
Real Estate
From time to time, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of a property exceeds the estimated fair value, for properties classified as held for use, or the estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, for properties classified as held for sale. Additionally, we are generally required to initially measure real estate recognized in connection with our consolidation of real estate partnerships at fair value.
We estimate the fair value of real estate using income and market valuation techniques using information such as broker estimates, purchase prices for recent transactions on comparable assets and net operating income capitalization analyses using observable and unobservable inputs such as capitalization rates, asset quality grading, geographic location analysis, and local supply and demand observations. For certain properties classified as held for sale, we may also recognize the impairment loss based on the contract sale price, which we believe is representative of fair value, less estimated selling costs.
Notes Receivable
We assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis, which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the real estate, which represents the primary source of loan repayment. The fair value of real estate is estimated through income and market valuation approaches using information such as broker estimates, purchase prices for recent transactions on comparable assets and net operating income capitalization analyses using observable and unobservable inputs such as capitalization rates, asset quality grading, geographic location analysis, and local supply and demand observations.
Interest Rate Swaps
We recognized interest rate swaps at their estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps using an income approach with primarily observable inputs, including information regarding the hedged variable cash flows and forward yield curves relating to the variable interest rates on which the hedged cash flows are based.
 
Total Rate of Return Swaps
Our total rate of return swaps have contractually-defined termination values generally equal to the difference between the fair value and the counterparty's purchased value of the underlying borrowings. Upon termination, we are required to pay the counterparty the difference if the fair value is less than the purchased value, and the counterparty is required to pay us the difference if the fair value is greater than the purchased value. The underlying borrowings are generally callable, at our option, at face value prior to maturity and with no prepayment penalty. Due to our control of the call features in the underlying borrowings, we believe the inherent value of any differential between the fixed and variable cash payments due under the swaps would be significantly discounted by a market participant willing to purchase or assume any rights and obligations under these contracts.
The swaps are generally cross-collateralized with other swap contracts with the same counterparty and do not allow transfer or assignment, thus there is no alternate or secondary market for these instruments. Accordingly, our assumptions about the fair value that a willing market participant would assign in valuing these instruments are based on a hypothetical market in which the highest and best use of these contracts is in-use in combination with the related borrowings, similar to how we use the contracts. Based on these assumptions, we believe the termination value, or exit value, of the swaps approximates the fair value that would be assigned by a willing market participant. We calculate the termination value using a market approach by reference to estimates of the fair value of the underlying borrowings, which are discussed below, and an evaluation of potential changes in the credit quality of the counterparties to these arrangements. We compare our estimates of the fair value of the swaps and related borrowings to the valuations provided by the counterparties on a quarterly basis.
Non-recourse Property Debt
We recognize changes in the fair value of the non-recourse property debt subject to total rate of return swaps discussed above, which we have designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, we are generally required to initially measure non-recourse property debt recognized in connection with our consolidation of real estate partnerships at fair value.
We estimate the fair value of debt instruments using an income and market approach, including comparison of the contractual terms to observable and unobservable inputs such as market interest rate risk spreads, collateral quality and loan-to-value ratios on similarly encumbered assets within our portfolio. These borrowings are collateralized and non-recourse to us; therefore, we believe changes in our credit rating will not materially affect a market participant's estimate of the borrowings' fair value.
The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
The table below presents amounts at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (and the changes in fair value between such dates) for significant items measured in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands). Certain of these fair value measurements are based on significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. When a determination is made to classify a fair value measurement within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, Level 3 fair value measurements typically include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components that can be validated to observable external sources; accordingly, the changes in fair value in the table below are due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.
 
The table below presents information regarding significant amounts measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of which were based, in part, on significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy (in thousands):
 
Disclosures Regarding Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We believe that the aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short-term secured debt approximates their aggregate carrying value at December 31, 2010, due to their relatively short-term nature and high probability of realization. We estimate fair value for our notes receivable and debt instruments as discussed in the preceding Fair Value Measurements section The estimated aggregate fair value of our notes receivable was approximately $126.0 million and $126.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as compared to carrying amounts of $137.6 million and $139.6 million, respectively. See Note 5 for further information on notes receivable. The estimated aggregate fair value of our consolidated debt (including amounts reported in liabilities related to assets held for sale) was approximately $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as compared to the carrying amounts of $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively. See Note 6 and Note 7 for further details on our consolidated debt. Refer to for further discussion regarding certain of our fixed rate debt that is subject to total rate of return swap instruments.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Income Taxes
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and intend to continue to operate in such a manner. Our current and continuing qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Code, which are related to organizational structure, distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership and certain restrictions with regard to owned assets and categories of income. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to United States Federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the "double taxation" (at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from an investment in a corporation.
Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to United States Federal income and excise taxes in various situations, such as on our undistributed income. We also will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income on non-arms length transactions between us and a TRS (described below) and on any net income from sales of property that was property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course. We and our stockholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or our stockholders reside. In addition, we could also be subject to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, on our items of tax preference. The state and local tax laws may not conform to the United States Federal income tax treatment. Any taxes imposed on us reduce our operating cash flow and net income.
Certain of our operations or a portion thereof, including property management, asset management and risk management, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are subsidiaries of the Aimco Operating Partnership, and each of which we refer to as a TRS. A TRS is a C-corporation that has not elected REIT status and as such is subject to United States Federal corporate income tax. We use TRS entities to facilitate our ability to offer certain services and activities to our residents and investment partners that cannot be offered directly by a REIT. We also use TRS entities to hold investments in certain properties.
For our TRS entities, deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for Federal income tax purposes, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We reduce deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance when we determine based on available evidence that it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. We recognize the tax consequences associated with intercompany transfers between the REIT and TRS entities when the related assets are sold to third parties, impaired or otherwise disposed of for financial reporting purposes.
In March 2008, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that it intended to examine the 2006 Federal tax return for the Aimco Operating Partnership. During June 2008, the IRS issued AIMCO-GP, Inc., the general and tax matters partner of the Aimco Operating Partnership, a summary report including the IRS's proposed adjustments to the Aimco Operating Partnership's 2006 Federal tax return. In addition, in May 2009, we were notified by the IRS that it intended to examine the 2007 Federal tax return for the Aimco Operating Partnership. During November 2009, the IRS issued AIMCO-GP, Inc. a summary report including the IRS's proposed adjustments to the Aimco Operating Partnership's 2007 Federal tax return. The matter is currently pending administratively before IRS Appeals and the IRS has made no determination. We do not expect the 2006 or 2007 proposed adjustments to have any material effect on our unrecognized tax benefits, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially could subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of notes receivable and total rate of return swaps. Approximately $89.3 million of our notes receivable, or 1.2% of the carrying amount of our total assets, at December 31, 2010, are collateralized by 84 buildings with 1,596 residential units in the West Harlem area of New York City. There are no other significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to our notes receivable due to the large number of partnerships that are borrowers under the notes and the geographic diversification of the properties that serve as the primary source of repayment of the notes.
At December 31, 2010, we had total rate of return swap positions with two financial institutions totaling $277.3 million. We periodically evaluate counterparty credit risk associated with these arrangements. At the current time, we have concluded we do not have material exposure. In the event either counterparty were to default under these arrangements, loss of the net interest benefit we generally receive under these arrangements, which is equal to the difference between the fixed rate we receive and the variable rate we pay, may adversely impact our results of operations and operating cash flows.
Comprehensive Income or Loss
As discussed in the Derivative Financial Instruments section, we recognize changes in the fair value of our cash flow hedges as changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, before the effects of noncontrolling interests, our consolidated comprehensive loss totaled $90.7 million and $43.4 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2008, our consolidated comprehensive income totaled $624.9 million.
Earnings per Share
We calculate earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, common stock equivalents, participating securities and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period (see Note 14).
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications and Adjustments
Certain items included in the 2009 and 2008 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation, including adjustments for discontinued operations.
During the three months ended March 31, 2010, we reduced the investment and noncontrolling interest balances for certain of our consolidated partnerships by $38.7 million related to excess amounts allocated to the investments upon our consolidation of such partnerships.
NOTE 3  Real Estate and Partnership Acquisitions and Other Significant Transactions
Real Estate Acquisitions
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not acquire any significant real estate properties.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we acquired three conventional properties with a total of 470 units, located in San Jose, California, Brighton, Massachusetts and Seattle, Washington. The aggregate purchase price of $111.5 million, excluding transaction costs, was funded using $39.0 million in proceeds from property loans, $41.9 million in tax-free exchange proceeds (provided by 2008 real estate dispositions) and the remainder in cash.
 
Acquisitions of Noncontrolling Partnership Interests
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling limited partnership interests in two consolidated partnerships, in which our affiliates serve as general partner, for total consideration of $19.9 million. This consideration consisted of $12.5 million in cash, $6.9 million in common OP Units and $0.5 million of other consideration. We also acquired for $1.8 million additional noncontrolling interests in a consolidated partnership for $1.2 million in cash and other consideration. We recognized the $27.4 million excess of the consideration paid over the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests acquired as an adjustment of additional paid-in capital within Aimco equity. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not acquire any significant noncontrolling limited partnership interests.
Disposition of Unconsolidated Real Estate and Other
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $10.7 million in net gains on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other. These gains were primarily related to sales of investments held by partnerships we consolidated in accordance with our adoption of ASU 2009-17 (see Note 2) and in which we generally hold a nominal general partner interest. Accordingly, these gains were primarily attributed to the noncontrolling interests in these partnerships.
During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $21.6 million in net gains on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other. Gains recognized in 2009 primarily consist of $8.6 million related to our receipt in 2009 of additional proceeds related to our disposition during 2008 of one of the partnership interests (discussed below), $4.0 million from the disposition of our interest in a group purchasing organization (discussed below), $5.5 million from our disposition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships and $3.5 million of net gains related to various other transactions.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized $97.4 million in net gains on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other, which primarily consisted of a $98.4 million gain recognized on the disposal of our interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships that owned two properties with 671 units.
Sale of Interest in Group Purchasing Organization
During 2009, we sold our interest in an unconsolidated group purchasing organization to an unrelated entity for $5.9 million, resulting in the recognition of a gain on sale of $4.0 million, which is included in gain on disposition of unconsolidated real estate and other in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. This gain was partially offset by a $1.0 million provision for income tax. We also had a note receivable from another principal in the group purchasing organization, which was collateralized by its equity interest in the entity. In connection with the sale of our interest, we reevaluated collectibility of the note receivable and reversed $1.4 million of previously recognized impairment losses, which is reflected in provision for losses on notes receivable, net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received payment of the remaining outstanding $1.6 million balance on the note.
Casualty Loss Related to Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike
During 2008, Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricane Ike caused severe damage to certain of our properties located primarily in Florida and Texas, respectively. We incurred total losses of approximately $33.9 million, including property damage replacement costs and clean-up costs. After consideration of estimated third party insurance proceeds and the noncontrolling interest partners' share of losses for consolidated real estate partnerships, the net effect of these casualties on net income available to Aimco common stockholders was a loss of approximately $5.0 million.
Restructuring Costs
In connection with 2008 property sales and an expected reduction in redevelopment and transactional activities, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we initiated an organizational restructuring program that included reductions in workforce and related costs, reductions in leased corporate facilities and abandonment of certain redevelopment projects and business pursuits. This restructuring effort resulted in a restructuring charge of $22.8 million, which consisted of: severance costs of $12.9 million; unrecoverable lease obligations of $6.4 million related to space that we will no longer use; and the write-off of deferred transaction costs totaling $3.5 million associated with certain acquisitions and redevelopment opportunities that we will no longer pursue. We completed the workforce reductions by March 31, 2009.
During 2009, in connection with continued repositioning of our portfolio, we completed additional organizational restructuring activities that included reductions in workforce and related costs and the abandonment of additional leased corporate facilities and redevelopment projects. Our 2009 restructuring activities resulted in a restructuring charge of $11.2 million, which consisted of severance costs and personnel related costs of $7.0 million; unrecoverable lease obligations of $2.6 million related to space that we will no longer use; the write-off of deferred costs totaling $0.9 million associated with certain redevelopment opportunities that we will no longer pursue; and $0.7 million in other costs.
 
As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the remaining accruals associated with these restructuring activities were $4.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively, for estimated unrecoverable lease obligations, which will be paid over the remaining terms of the affected leases, and at December 31, 2009, we had $4.7 million accrued for severance and personnel related costs, which were paid during the first quarter of 2010.
NOTE 4  Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships
We owned general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships owning approximately 173, 77 and 85 properties at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We acquired these interests through various transactions, including large portfolio acquisitions and offers to individual limited partners. Our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships typically ranges from less than 1% to 50% and in some instances may exceed 50%.
The following table provides selected combined financial information for the unconsolidated real estate partnerships in which we had investments accounted for under the equity method as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
The increase in the number of partnerships we account for using the equity method and the related selected combined financial information for such partnerships is primarily attributed to our adoption of ASU 2009-17 (see Note 2), pursuant to which we consolidated 18 investment partnerships that hold investments in other unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Prior to our consolidation of these investment partnerships, we had no recognized basis in the investment partnerships' investments in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and accounted for our indirect interests in these partnerships using the cost method. We generally hold a nominal general partnership interest in these investment partnerships and substantially all of the assets and liabilities of these investment partnerships are attributed to the noncontrolling interests in such entities.
As a result of our acquisition of interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships at a cost in excess of the historical carrying amount of the partnerships' net assets and our consolidation of investment partnerships and their investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships at fair values that may exceed the historical carrying amount of the unconsolidated partnerships' net assets, our aggregate investment in unconsolidated partnerships at December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $59.3 million and $105.3 million, respectively, exceeds our share of the underlying historical partners' deficit of the partnerships by approximately $63.0 million and $109.5 million, respectively.
 
NOTE 5  Notes Receivable
The following table summarizes our notes receivable at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
Included in notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships at December 31, 2010 and 2009, are $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in notes that were secured by interests in real estate or interests in real estate partnerships. We earn interest on these secured notes receivable at an annual interest rate of 12.0%.
Included in the notes receivable from non-affiliates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, are $103.9 million and $102.2 million, respectively, in notes that were secured by interests in real estate or interests in real estate partnerships. We earn interest on these secured notes receivable at various annual interest rates ranging between 3.5% and 12.0% and averaging 4.1%.
Notes receivable from non-affiliates at December 31, 2010 and 2009, include notes receivable totaling $89.3 million and $87.4 million, respectively, from certain entities (the "borrowers") that are wholly owned by a single individual. We originated these notes in November 2006 pursuant to a loan agreement that provides for total funding of approximately $110.0 million, including $16.4 million for property improvements and an interest reserve, of which $3.8 million had not been funded as of December 31, 2010. The notes mature in November 2016, bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.0%, are partially guaranteed by the owner of the borrowers, and are collateralized by second mortgages on 84 buildings containing 1,596 residential units and 43 commercial spaces in West Harlem, New York City. In conjunction with the loan agreement, we entered into a purchase option and put agreement with the borrowers under which we may purchase some or all of the buildings and, subject to achieving specified increases in rental income, the borrowers may require us to purchase the buildings (see Note 8). We determined that the stated interest rate on the notes on the date the loan was originated was a below-market interest rate and recorded a $19.4 million discount to reflect the estimated fair value of the notes based on an estimated market interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.0%. The discount was determined to be attributable to our real estate purchase option, which we recorded separately in other assets. Accretion of this discount, which is included in interest income in our consolidated statements of operations, totaled $0.9 million in 2010, $0.9 million in 2009 and $0.7 million in 2008. The value of the purchase option asset will be included in the cost of properties acquired pursuant to the option or otherwise be charged to expense. We determined that the borrowers are VIEs and, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis, determined that the individual who owns the borrowers and partially guarantees the notes is the primary beneficiary.
As part of the March 2002 acquisition of Casden Properties, Inc., we invested $50.0 million for a 20% passive interest in Casden Properties LLC, an entity organized to acquire, re-entitle and develop land parcels in Southern California. Based upon the profit allocation agreement, we account for this investment as a note receivable from a non-affiliate and through 2008 were amortizing the discounted value of the investment to the $50.0 million previously estimated to be collectible, through the initial dissolution date of the entity. As a result of a declines in land values in Southern California, we determined our recorded investment amount was not fully recoverable, and accordingly recognized impairment losses of $20.7 million ($12.4 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2009 and $16.3 million ($10.0 million net of tax) during the three months ended December 31, 2008.
 
The activity in the allowance for loan losses related to our notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and non-affiliates, in total for both par value notes and discounted notes, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, is as follows (in thousands):
In addition to the provisions shown above, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we wrote off $0.5 million of receivables that were not reserved through the allowance.
Additional information regarding our par value notes and discounted notes impaired during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is presented in the table below (in thousands):
The remaining $27.0 million of our par value notes receivable at December 31, 2010, is estimated to be collectible and, therefore, interest income on these par value notes is recognized as earned. Of our total par value notes outstanding at December 31, 2010, notes with balances of $17.5 million have stated maturity dates and the remainder have no stated maturity date and are governed by the terms of the partnership agreements pursuant to which the loans were extended. At December 31, 2010, none of the par value notes with stated maturity dates were past due. The information in the table above regarding our discounted notes excludes the impairment related to our investment in Casden Properties LLC. No interest income has been recognized on our investment in Casden Properties LLC following the initial impairment recognized during 2008.
In addition to the interest income recognized on impaired loans shown above, we recognized interest income, including accretion, of $7.7 million, $5.8 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to our remaining notes receivable.
 
We finance our properties primarily using long-dated, fixed-rate debt that is collateralized by the underlying real estate properties and is non-recourse to us. The following table summarizes our property tax-exempt bond financings related to properties classified as held for use at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
Fixed rate property tax-exempt bonds payable mature at various dates through January 2050. Variable rate property tax-exempt bonds payable mature at various dates through July 2033. Principal and interest on these bonds are generally payable in semi-annual installments with balloon payments due at maturity. Certain of our property tax-exempt bonds at December 31, 2010, are remarketed periodically by a remarketing agent to maintain a variable yield. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket the bonds, then the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. We believe that the likelihood of this occurring is remote. At December 31, 2010, our property tax-exempt bond financings related to properties classified as held for use were secured by 38 properties with a combined net book value of $722.0 million. At December 31, 2010, property tax-exempt bonds payable with a weighted average fixed rate of 6.7% have been converted to a weighted average variable rate of 1.6% using total rate of return swaps that mature during 2012. These property tax-exempt bonds payable are presented above as variable rate debt at their carrying amounts, or fair value, of $229.1 million. See Note 2 for further discussion of our total rate of return swap arrangements.
The following table summarizes our property loans payable related to properties classified as held for use at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):
Fixed rate property notes payable mature at various dates through December 2049. Variable rate property notes payable mature at various dates through November 2030. Principal and interest are generally payable monthly or in monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. At December 31, 2010, our property notes payable related to properties classified as held for use were secured by 338 properties with a combined net book value of $5,680.1 million. In connection with our 2010 adoption of ASU 2009-17 (see Note 2), we consolidated and deconsolidated various partnerships, which resulted in a net increase in property loans payable of approximately $61.2 million as compared to 2009. The remainder of the increase in property loans payable during the year is primarily due to refinancing activities. At December 31, 2010, property loans payable with a weighted average fixed rate of 7.5% have been converted to a weighted average variable rate of 1.6% using total rate of return swaps that mature during 2012, which is the same year the notes payable mature. These property loans payable are presented above as variable rate debt at their carrying amounts, or fair value, of $28.7 million. See Note 2 for further discussion of our total rate of return swap arrangements.
At December 31, 2009, we had a secured revolving credit facility with a major life company that provided for borrowings of up to $200.0 million. During 2010, the credit facility was modified to reduce allowed borrowings to the then outstanding borrowings and to remove the option for new loans under the facility. During 2010, we also exercised an option to extend the maturity date to October 2011 for a nominal fee. At December 31, 2010, outstanding borrowings of $13.6 million related to properties classified as held for use are included in 2012 maturities below based on a remaining one-year extension option for nominal cost.
 
Our consolidated debt instruments generally contain covenants common to the type of facility or borrowing, including financial covenants establishing minimum debt service coverage ratios and maximum leverage ratios. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial covenants pertaining to our consolidated debt instruments.
Other borrowings totaled $47.0 million and $53.1 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We classify within other borrowings notes payable that do not have a collateral interest in real estate properties but for which real estate serves as the primary source of repayment. These borrowings are generally non-recourse to us. At December 31, 2010, other borrowings includes $38.5 million in fixed rate obligations with interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 10.0% and $8.5 million in variable rate obligations bearing interest at the prime rate plus 1.75%. The maturity dates for other borrowings range from 2011 to 2014, although certain amounts are due upon occurrence of specified events, such as property sales.
As of December 31, 2010, the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our property tax-exempt bonds, property notes payable and other borrowings related to properties in continuing operations are as follows (in thousands):
Amortization for 2011, 2012 and 2013 in the table above includes $6.5 million, $5.9 million and $9.6 million, respectively, and maturities for 2011, 2012 and thereafter includes $13.3 million, $11.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to other borrowings at December 31, 2010.
NOTE 7  Credit Agreement and Term Loan
We have an Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement, as amended, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as the Credit Agreement. In addition to Aimco, the Aimco Operating Partnership and an Aimco subsidiary are also borrowers under the Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2010, the Credit Agreement consisted of $300.0 million of revolving loan commitments (an increase of $120.0 million from the revolving commitments at December 31, 2009). As of December 31, 2009, the Credit Agreement consisted of aggregate commitments of $270.0 million, consisting of the $90.0 million outstanding balance on our term loan and $180.0 million of revolving commitments. During 2010, we repaid in full the remaining balance on the term loan.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on a pricing grid determined by leverage (either at LIBOR plus 4.25% with a LIBOR floor of 1.50% or, at our option, a base rate equal to the Prime rate plus a spread of 3.00%). The revolving credit facility matures May 1, 2013, and may be extended for an additional year, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 35.0 basis point fee on the total revolving commitments. As of December 31, 2010, we had the capacity to borrow $260.3 million pursuant to our credit facility (after giving effect to $39.7 million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit).
The Credit Agreement includes customary financial covenants, including the maintenance of specified ratios with respect to total indebtedness to gross asset value, total secured indebtedness to gross asset value, aggregate recourse indebtedness to gross asset value, variable rate debt to total indebtedness, debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage; the maintenance of a minimum adjusted tangible net worth; and limitations regarding the amount of cross-collateralized debt. The Credit Agreement includes other customary covenants, including a restriction on distributions and other restricted payments, but permits distributions during any four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount of up to 95% of our funds from operations for such period, subject to certain non-cash adjustments, or such amount as may be necessary to maintain our REIT status. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2010.
The lenders under the Credit Agreement may accelerate any outstanding loans if, among other things: we fail to make payments when due (subject to applicable grace periods); material defaults occur under other debt agreements; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events occur; material judgments are entered against us; we fail to comply with certain covenants, such as the requirement to deliver financial information or the requirement to provide notices regarding material events (subject to applicable grace periods in some cases); indebtedness is incurred in violation of the covenants; or prohibited liens arise.
 
NOTE 8  Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
We did not have any significant commitments related to our redevelopment activities at December 31, 2010. We enter into certain commitments for future purchases of goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
As discussed in Note 5, we have committed to fund an additional $3.8 million in loans on certain properties in West Harlem in New York City. In certain circumstances, the obligor under these notes has the ability to put properties to us, which would result in a cash payment of approximately $30.6 million and the assumption of approximately $118.6 million in property debt. The ability to exercise the put is dependent upon the achievement of specified thresholds by the current owner of the properties.
As discussed in Note 11, we have a potential obligation to repurchase $20.0 million in liquidation preference of our Series A Community Reinvestment Act Preferred Stock for $14.0 million.
Tax Credit Arrangements
We are required to manage certain consolidated real estate partnerships in compliance with various laws, regulations and contractual provisions that apply to our historic and low-income housing tax credit syndication arrangements. In some instances, noncompliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and require a refund or reduction of investor capital contributions, which are reported as deferred income in our consolidated balance sheet, until such time as our obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. The remaining compliance periods for our tax credit syndication arrangements range from less than one year to 15 years. We do not anticipate that any material refunds or reductions of investor capital contributions will be required in connection with these arrangements.
Legal Matters
In addition to the matters described below, we are a party to various legal actions and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which are covered by our general liability insurance program, and none of which we expect to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Limited Partnerships
In connection with our acquisitions of interests in real estate partnerships and our role as general partner in certain real estate partnerships, we are sometimes subject to legal actions, including allegations that such activities may involve breaches of fiduciary duties to the partners of such real estate partnerships or violations of the relevant partnership agreements. We may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of such litigation. We believe that we comply with our fiduciary obligations and relevant partnership agreements. Although the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not expect any such legal actions to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Environmental
Various Federal, state and local laws subject property owners or operators to liability for management, and the costs of removal or remediation, of certain potentially hazardous materials present on a property, including lead-based paint, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, petroleum-based fuels, and other miscellaneous materials. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such materials. The presence of, or the failure to manage or remedy properly, these materials may adversely affect occupancy at affected apartment communities and the ability to sell or finance affected properties. In addition to the costs associated with investigation and remediation actions brought by government agencies, and potential fines or penalties imposed by such agencies in connection therewith, the improper management of these materials on a property could result in claims by private plaintiffs for personal injury, disease, disability or other infirmities. Various laws also impose liability for the cost of removal, remediation or disposal of these materials through a licensed disposal or treatment facility. Anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of these materials is potentially liable under such laws. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of properties, we could potentially be responsible for environmental liabilities or costs associated with our properties or properties we acquire or manage in the future.
We have determined that our legal obligations to remove or remediate certain potentially hazardous materials may be conditional asset retirement obligations, as defined in GAAP. Except in limited circumstances where the asset retirement activities are expected to be performed in connection with a planned construction project or property casualty, we believe that the fair value of our asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated due to significant uncertainties in the timing and manner of settlement of those obligations. Asset retirement obligations that are reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2010, are immaterial to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Operating Leases
We are obligated under non-cancelable operating leases for office space and equipment. In addition, we sublease certain of our office space to tenants under non-cancelable subleases. Approximate minimum annual rentals under operating leases and approximate minimum payments to be received under annual subleases are as follows (in thousands):
Substantially all of the office space subject to the operating leases described above is for the use of our corporate offices and area operations. Rent expense recognized totaled $6.6 million, $7.7 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sublease receipts that offset rent expense totaled approximately $1.6 million, $0.7 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
As discussed in Note 3, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we commenced restructuring activities pursuant to which we vacated certain leased office space for which we remain obligated. In connection with the restructurings, we accrued amounts representing the estimated fair value of certain lease obligations related to space we are no longer using, reduced by estimated sublease amounts. At December 31, 2010, approximately $4.7 million related to the above operating lease obligations was included in accrued liabilities related to these estimates.
Additionally, during January 2011, we provided notice of our intent to terminate one of the leases included in the table above effective March 31, 2012, and we paid the required lease termination payment of approximately $1.3 million. Obligations shown in the table above reflect our revised obligations following the lease buyout.
 
NOTE 9  Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the taxable REIT subsidiaries for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows (in thousands):
At December 31, 2010, we increased the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets by $1.8 million for certain state net operating losses as well as certain low income housing credits based on a determination that it was more likely than not that such assets will not be realized prior to their expiration.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our unrecognized tax benefits is presented below (in thousands):
We do not anticipate any material changes in existing unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. Because the statute of limitations has not yet elapsed, our Federal income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2007, and subsequent years and certain of our State income tax returns for the year ended December 31, 2005, and subsequent years are currently subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities. Approximately $3.3 million of the unrecognized tax benefit, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. As discussed in Note 2, the IRS has issued us summary reports including its proposed adjustments to the Aimco Operating Partnership's 2007 and 2006 Federal tax returns. We do not expect the proposed adjustments to have any material effect on our unrecognized tax benefits, financial condition or results of operations. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to income taxes in income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations.
In accordance with the accounting requirements for stock-based compensation, we may recognize tax benefits in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees of our taxable subsidiaries and the vesting of restricted stock awards. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and vested restricted stock awards.
 
Significant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are as follows and are classified within income tax benefit in continuing operations and income from discontinued operations, net in our statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
Consolidated losses subject to tax, consisting of pretax income or loss of our taxable REIT subsidiaries and gains or losses on certain property sales that are subject to income tax under section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $50.3 million, $40.6 million and $81.8 million, respectively. The reconciliation of income tax attributable to continuing and discontinued operations computed at the U.S. statutory rate to income tax benefit is shown below (dollars in thousands):
Income taxes paid totaled approximately $1.9 million, $4.6 million and $13.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
At December 31, 2010, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $73.7 million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2027 to 2030. Subject to certain separate return limitations, we may use these NOLs to offset all or a portion of taxable income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We generated approximately $9.8 million of NOLs during the year ended December 31, 2010, as a result of losses from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The deductibility of intercompany interest expense with our taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to certain intercompany limitations based upon taxable income as required under Section 163(j) of the Code. As of December 31, 2010, interest carryovers of approximately $23.7 million, limited by Section 163(j) of the Code, are available against U.S. Federal tax without expiration. The deferred tax asset related to these interest carryovers is approximately $9.2 million. Additionally, our low-income housing and rehabilitation tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010, were approximately $7.7 million for income tax purposes that expire in years 2012 to 2029. The net deferred tax asset related to these credits is approximately $6.0 million.
 
For income tax purposes, dividends paid to holders of Common Stock primarily consist of ordinary income, return of capital, capital gains, qualified dividends and unrecaptured Section 1250 gains, or a combination thereof. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, dividends per share held for the entire year were estimated to be taxable as follows:
NOTE 10  Transactions Involving Noncontrolling Interests in Aimco Operating Partnership
In December 2008, October 2008, July 2008, and December 2007, the Aimco Operating Partnership declared special distributions payable on January 29, 2009, December 1, 2008, August 29, 2008 and January 30, 2008, respectively, to holders of record of common OP Units and High Performance Units on December 29, 2008, October 27, 2008, July 28, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The special distributions were paid on common OP Units and High Performance Units in the amounts listed below. The Aimco Operating Partnership distributed to Aimco common OP Units equal to the number of shares we issued pursuant to our corresponding special dividends (discussed in Note 11) in addition to approximately $0.60 per unit in cash. Holders of common OP Units other than Aimco and holders of High Performance Units received the distributions entirely in cash.
 
Preferred OP Units
Various classes of preferred OP Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership are outstanding. Preferred OP Units entitle the holders thereof to a preference with respect to distributions or upon liquidation. Depending on the terms of each class, these preferred OP Units are convertible into common OP Units or redeemable for cash, or at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option, Common Stock, and are paid distributions varying from 1.8% to 8.8% per annum per unit, or equal to the dividends paid on Common Stock based on the conversion terms. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, a total of 3.1 million preferred OP Units were outstanding with redemption values of $82.6 million and $85.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, these preferred OP Units were redeemable into approximately 3.2 million and 5.2 million shares of Common Stock, respectively, or cash at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option, and were included in temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheets.
The following table presents a reconciliation of preferred noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
The effects on our equity of changes in our ownership interest in the Aimco Operating Partnership are reflected in our consolidated statement of equity as redemptions of Aimco Operating Partnership units for Common Stock and repurchases of common OP Units.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we purchased approximately 68,700 preferred OP Units from the holder in exchange for cash and other consideration, and during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 14,800 and 68,200 preferred OP Units, respectively, were tendered for redemption in exchange for cash. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, no preferred OP Units were tendered for redemption in exchange for shares of Common Stock. The Aimco Operating Partnership has a redemption policy that requires cash settlement of redemption requests for the redeemable preferred OP Units, subject to limited exceptions.
Common OP Units
The holders of the common OP Units receive distributions, prorated from the date of issuance, in an amount equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of Common Stock, and may redeem such units for cash or, at the Aimco Operating Partnership's option, Common Stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we acquired the noncontrolling limited partnership interests in certain of our consolidated real estate partnerships in exchange for cash and the Aimco Operating Partnership's issuance of approximately 276,000 common OP Units. We completed no similar acquisitions of noncontrolling interests during 2009 or 2008.
During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 168,300 and 64,000 common OP Units, respectively, were redeemed in exchange for cash, and approximately 519,000 common OP Units were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock in 2009. No common OP Units were redeemed in exchange for shares of Common Stock in 2010.
High Performance Units
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Aimco Operating Partnership had outstanding 2,339,950 and 2,344,719, respectively, of high performance partnership units, or HPUs. The holders of HPUs are generally restricted from transferring these units except upon a change of control in the Aimco Operating Partnership. The holders of HPUs receive the same amount of distributions that are paid to holders of an equivalent number of the Aimco Operating Partnership's outstanding common OP Units.
 
NOTE 11  Aimco Equity
Preferred Stock
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had the following classes of perpetual preferred stock outstanding (dollars in thousands):
 
On September 7, 2010, we issued 4,000,000 shares of our 7.75% Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Class U Preferred Stock, in an underwritten public offering for a price per share of $24.09 (reflecting a price to the public of $24.86 per share, less an underwriting discount and commissions of $0.77 per share). The offering generated net proceeds of $96.1 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and transaction expenses). We recorded issuance costs of $3.3 million, consisting primarily of underwriting commissions, as an adjustment of additional paid-in capital within Aimco equity in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.
On October 7, 2010, using the net proceeds from the issuance of Class U Preferred Stock supplemented by corporate funds, we redeemed all of the 4,050,000 outstanding shares of our 9.375% Class G Cumulative Preferred Stock, inclusive of 10,000 shares held by a consolidated subsidiary that are eliminated in consolidation. This redemption was for cash at a price equal to $25.00 per share, or $101.3 million in aggregate ($101.0 million net of eliminations), plus accumulated and unpaid dividends of $2.2 million. In connection with the redemption, we reflected $4.3 million of issuance costs previously recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital as an increase in net income attributable to preferred stockholders for purposes of calculating earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010.
In connection with our May 2010 and June 2009 CRA Preferred Stock repurchase discussed above, we reflected the $3.0 million and $1.8 million excess of the carrying value over the repurchase price, offset by $0.2 million of issuance costs previously recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, as a reduction of net income attributable to preferred stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
During 2008, we repurchased 54 shares, or $27.0 million in liquidation preference, of our CRA Preferred Stock for cash totaling $24.8 million. We reflected the $2.2 million excess of the carrying value over the repurchase price, offset by $0.7 million of issuance costs previously recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, as a reduction of net income attributable to preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2008.
All classes of preferred stock are pari passu with each other and are senior to our Common Stock. The holders of each class of preferred stock are generally not entitled to vote on matters submitted to stockholders. Dividends on all shares of preferred stock are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. All of the above outstanding classes of preferred stock have a liquidation preference per share of $25, with the exception of the CRA Preferred Stock, which has a liquidation preference per share of $500,000.
The dividends paid on each class of preferred stock classified as equity in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
 
Common Stock
In December 2008, October 2008, July 2008 and December 2007, in connection with the Aimco Operating Partnership's special distributions discussed in Note 10, our Board of Directors declared corresponding special dividends payable on January 29, 2009, December 1, 2008, August 29, 2008 and January 30, 2008, respectively, to holders of record of our Common Stock on December 29, 2008, October 27, 2008, July 28, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. A portion of the special dividends in the amounts of $0.60 per share represents payment of the regular dividend for the quarters ended December 31, 2008, September 30, 2008, June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, and the remaining amount per share represents an additional dividend associated with taxable gains from property dispositions. Portions of the special dividends were paid through the issuance of shares of Common Stock. The table below summarizes information regarding these special dividends.
During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 600,000 shares of our Common Stock pursuant to an At-The-Market, or ATM, offering program we initiated during 2010, generating $14.4 million of net proceeds.
During 2008 and prior years, from time to time, we issued shares of Common Stock to certain non-executive officers who purchased the shares at market prices. In exchange for the shares purchased, the officers executed notes payable. These notes, which are 25% recourse to the borrowers, have a 10-year maturity and bear interest either at a fixed rate of 6% annually or a floating rate based on the 30-day LIBOR plus 3.85%, which is subject to an annual interest rate cap of typically 7.25%. Total payments in 2010 and 2009 on all notes from officers were $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. In 2010 and 2009, we reacquired approximately 9,000 and 94,000 shares of Common Stock from officers in exchange for the cancellation of related notes totaling $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
As further discussed in Note 12, during 2010, 2009 and 2008, we issued shares of restricted Common Stock to certain officers, employees and independent directors.
Registration Statements
Pursuant to the ATM offering program discussed above, we may issue up to 6.4 million additional shares of our Common Stock. Additionally, we and the Aimco Operating Partnership have a shelf registration statement that provides for the issuance of debt and equity securities by Aimco and debt securities by the Aimco Operating Partnership.
 
NOTE 12  Share-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans
Stock Award and Incentive Plan
We have a stock award and incentive plan to attract and retain officers, key employees and independent directors. Our plan reserves for issuance a maximum of 4.1 million shares, which may be in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, or other types of awards as authorized under our plan. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance has been adjusted to reflect the special dividends discussed in Note 11. At December 31, 2010 there were approximately 1.3 million shares available to be granted under our plan. Our plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors. In the case of stock options, the exercise price of the options granted may not be less than the fair market value of Common Stock at the date of grant. The term of the options is generally ten years from the date of grant. The options typically vest over a period of one to four or five years from the date of grant. We generally issue new shares upon exercise of options. Restricted stock awards typically vest over a period of three to five years.
Refer to Note 2 for discussion of our accounting policy related to stock-based compensation.
We estimated the fair value of our options using a Black-Scholes closed-form valuation model using the assumptions set forth in the table below. The expected term of the options was based on historical option exercises and post-vesting terminations. Expected volatility reflects the historical volatility of our Common Stock during the historical period commensurate with the expected term of the options that ended on the date of grant. The expected dividend yield reflects expectations regarding cash dividend amounts per share paid on our Common Stock during the expected term of the option and the risk-free interest rate reflects the annualized yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a term equal to the expected term of the option. The weighted average fair value of options and our valuation assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:
The following table summarizes activity for our outstanding stock options for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (numbers of options in thousands):
 
The intrinsic value of a stock option represents the amount by which the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. Options outstanding at December 31, 2010, had an aggregate intrinsic value of $12.8 million and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 3.8 years. Options exercisable at December 31, 2010, had an aggregate intrinsic value of $2.4 million and a weighted average remaining contractual term of 3.1 years. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, was $2.9 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. We may realize tax benefits in connection with the exercise of options by employees of our taxable subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we did not recognize any significant tax benefits related to options exercised during the year, and during the year ended December 31, 2009, as no stock options were exercised we realized no related tax benefits.
The following table summarizes activity for restricted stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (numbers of shares in thousands):
The aggregate fair value of shares that vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $4.4 million, $3.1 million and $16.5 million, respectively.
Total compensation cost recognized for restricted stock and stock option awards was $8.1 million, $8.0 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, $0.8 million, $1.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, were capitalized. At December 31, 2010, total unvested compensation cost not yet recognized was $7.8 million. We expect to recognize this compensation over a weighted average period of approximately 1.7 years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the terms of our employee stock purchase plan, eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions up to 15% of their base compensation to purchase shares of our Common Stock at a five percent discount from its fair value on the last day of the calendar quarter during which payroll deductions are made. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, 5,662, 20,076 and 8,926 shares were purchased under this plan at an average price of $20.92, $8.82 and $23.86, respectively. No compensation cost is recognized in connection with this plan. Shares of Common Stock purchased under the employee stock purchase plan are treated as issued and outstanding on the date of purchase and dividends paid on such shares are recognized as a reduction of equity when such dividends are declared.
401(k) Plan
We provide a 401(k) defined-contribution employee savings plan. Employees who have completed 30 days of service and are age 18 or older are eligible to participate. For the period from January 1, 2009 through January 29, 2009, and during the year ended December 31, 2008, our matching contributions were made in the following manner: (1) a 100% match on the first 3% of the participant's compensation; and (2) a 50% match on the next 2% of the participant's compensation. On December 31, 2008, we suspended employer matching contributions effective January 29, 2009. We may reinstate employer matching contributions at any time. We incurred costs in connection with this plan of less than $0.1 million in 2010, $0.6 million in 2009 and $5.2 million in 2008.
 
NOTE 13  Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale
We report as discontinued operations real estate assets that meet the definition of a component of an entity and have been sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale. We include all results of these discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes, in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of operations under the heading "income from discontinued operations, net." This treatment resulted in the retrospective adjustment of the 2010, 2009 and 2008 statements of operations and the 2010 and 2009 balance sheets to reflect as discontinued operations all properties sold or classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2011.
We are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long-term investment strategy. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate whether such properties meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, including whether such properties are expected to be sold within 12 months. Additionally, certain properties that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale at the balance sheet date may nevertheless be sold and included in discontinued operations in the subsequent 12 months; thus the number of properties that may be sold during the subsequent 12 months could exceed the number classified as held for sale. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, after adjustments for properties that were sold or classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2011, we had 13 and 64 properties with an aggregate of 2,008 and 10,197 units, respectively, classified as held for sale. Amounts classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we sold 51, 89 and 151 consolidated properties with an aggregate 8,189, 22,503 and 37,202 units, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, discontinued operations includes the results of operations for the periods prior to the date of sale for all properties sold or classified as held for sale as of March 31, 2011.
 
The following is a summary of the components of income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
Gain on dispositions of real estate is reported net of incremental direct costs incurred in connection with the transactions, including any prepayment penalties incurred upon repayment of property loans collateralized by the properties being sold. Such prepayment penalties totaled $4.5 million, $29.0 million and $64.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We classify interest expense related to property debt within discontinued operations when the related real estate asset is sold or classified as held for sale. As discussed in Note 2, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we allocated $4.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively, of goodwill related to our real estate segment to the carrying amounts of the properties sold or classified as held for sale during the applicable periods. Of these amounts, $4.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively, were reflected as a reduction of gain on dispositions of real estate and $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, were reflected as an adjustment of impairment losses.
 
NOTE 14  Earnings per Share
We calculate earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock, participating securities, common stock equivalents and dilutive convertible securities outstanding during the period. The following table illustrates the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands, except per share data):
As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the common share equivalents that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in future periods totaled 7.2 million, 8.9 million and 9.2 million, respectively. These securities, representing stock options, have been excluded from the earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Participating securities, consisting of unvested restricted stock and shares purchased pursuant to officer loans, receive dividends similar to shares of Common Stock and totaled 0.6 million, 0.5 million and 1.0 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effect of participating securities is reflected in basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the periods presented above using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the adjustment to compensation expense recognized related to cumulative dividends on forfeited shares of restricted stock exceeded the amount of dividends declared related to participating securities. Accordingly, distributed earnings attributed to participating securities during 2010 and 2009 were reduced to zero for purposes of calculating earnings per share using the two-class method.
As discussed in Note 10, the Aimco Operating Partnership has various classes of preferred OP units, which may be redeemed at the holders' option. The Aimco Operating Partnership may redeem these units for cash or at its option, shares of Common Stock. During the periods presented, no common share equivalents related to these preferred OP units have been included in earnings per share computations because their effect was antidilutive.
 
NOTE 15  Unaudited Summarized Consolidated Quarterly Information
Summarized unaudited consolidated quarterly information for 2010 and 2009 is provided below (in thousands, except per share amounts).
NOTE 16  Transactions with Affiliates
We earn revenue from affiliated real estate partnerships. These revenues include fees for property management services, partnership and asset management services, risk management services and transactional services such as refinancing, construction supervisory and disposition (including promote income, which is income earned in connection with the disposition of properties owned by certain of our consolidated joint ventures). In addition, we are reimbursed for our costs in connection with the management of the unconsolidated real estate partnerships. These fees and reimbursements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 totaled $10.6 million, $18.5 million and $72.5 million, respectively. The total accounts receivable due from affiliates was $8.4 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.5 million, at December 31, 2010, and $23.7 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $1.9 million, at December 31, 2009.
Additionally, we earn interest income on notes from real estate partnerships in which we are the general partner and hold either par value or discounted notes. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we did not recognize a significant amount of interest income on par value notes from unconsolidated real estate partnerships. Accretion income recognized on discounted notes from affiliated real estate partnerships totaled $0.8 million, $0.1 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information on notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships.
 
NOTE 17  Business Segments
We have two reportable segments: conventional real estate operations and affordable real estate operations. Our conventional real estate operations consist of market-rate apartments with rents paid by the resident and included 219 properties with 68,972 units as of December 31, 2010. Our affordable real estate operations consisted of 228 properties with 26,540 units as of December 31, 2010, with rents that are generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency.
Our chief operating decision maker uses various generally accepted industry financial measures to assess the performance and financial condition of the business, including: Net Asset Value, which is the estimated fair value of our assets, net of liabilities and preferred equity; Pro forma Funds From Operations, which is Funds From Operations excluding operating real estate impairment losses and preferred equity redemption related amounts; Adjusted Funds From Operations, which is Pro forma Funds From Operations less spending for Capital Replacements; property net operating income, which is rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes; proportionate property net operating income, which reflects our share of property net operating income of our consolidated and unconsolidated properties; same store property operating results; Free Cash Flow, which is net operating income less spending for Capital Replacements; Free Cash Flow internal rate of return; financial coverage ratios; and leverage as shown on our balance sheet. Our chief operating decision maker emphasizes proportionate property net operating income as a key measurement of segment profit or loss.
During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we revised certain of the reports our chief operating decision maker uses to assess the performance of our business to include additional information about proportionate operating results of our segments. Based on the change in our measure of segment performance, we have recast the presentation of our segment results for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, to be consistent with the current presentation.
The following tables present the revenues, expenses, net operating income (loss) and income (loss) from continuing operations of our conventional and affordable real estate operations segments on a proportionate basis for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):
 
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, for continuing operations, our rental revenues include $128.4 million, $124.2 million and $116.8 million, respectively, of subsidies from government agencies, which exceeded 10% of the combined revenues of our conventional and affordable segments for each of the years presented.
 
The assets of our reportable segments on a proportionate basis, together with the proportionate adjustments to reconcile these amounts to the consolidated assets of our segments, and the consolidated assets not allocated to our segments are as follows (in thousands):
For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, capital additions related to our conventional segment totaled $140.1 million, $208.0 million and $516.6 million, respectively, and capital additions related to our affordable segment totaled $35.2 million, $67.4 million and $148.6 million, respectively.
