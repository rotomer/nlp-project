Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement
     On August 24, 2011, Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company") and AIMCO Properties, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") entered into an At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the "Sales Agreement") with McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, to sell up to 4,000,000 shares (the "Securities") of the Company's 7.00% Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Class Z Preferred Stock"), from time to time through an "at the market" equity offering program under which McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC will act as sales agent ("MLV").
     Pursuant to the Sales Agreement, the Securities may be offered and sold through MLV in transactions that are deemed to be "at the market" offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as in privately negotiated transactions. The Sales Agreement provides that MLV will be entitled to compensation of up to 2.00% of the gross sales price of the Securities sold through MLV from time to time under the Sales Agreement. We may also sell shares of Class Z Preferred Stock to MLV as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Securities under the Sales Agreement, and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the Sales Agreement.
     The Securities will be issued pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-173503). The Company filed a prospectus supplement, dated August 24, 2011 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities.
     MLV and its affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, various investment banking and advisory services to us from time to time for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees and expenses. MLV previously acted as book-running manager and representative of the several underwriters in the initial public offering of 800,000 shares of our Class Z Preferred Stock that was conducted on a "best efforts" basis.

The Company will furnish to MLV and its counsel (at the expense of the Company) copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference therein) and all amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement or Prospectus, and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, that are filed with the Commission during any period in which a Prospectus relating to the Placement Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, in each case as soon as reasonably practicable and in such quantities and at such locations as MLV may from time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to furnish any document (other than the Prospectus, which may be delivered in electronic form) to MLV to the extent such document is available on EDGAR.

If at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus conflicted, conflicts or would conflict with the information contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or included, includes or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, omits or would omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify MLV to suspend the offering of Placement Securities during such period and the Company will, subject to Section 7(a) hereof, promptly amend or supplement such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws

     (a) . The Company and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless MLV and each person, if any, who controls MLV within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any director, officer, employee or affiliate thereof as follows:
Indemnification by the Company
          (i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
 
          (ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; and
          (iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above, provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by MLV expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto); provided, further, that the parties hereby agree that the only such information in the Prospectus is that set forth in the eighth paragraph with regard to affiliates of MLV under the caption "Plan of Distribution" in the Prospectus Supplement, and MLV hereby consents to the use in the Prospectus of such information.
     (b) . MLV agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Operating Partnership, each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and any officer, director or employee thereof, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section 10, as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by MLV expressly for use therein.
Indemnification by MLV
     (c) . Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense. The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (2) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (3) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (4) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm (in addition to local counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 10 or Section 11 hereof whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto, unless (x) such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party and (y) the indemnifying party confirms in writing its indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such settlement, compromise or judgment. Notwithstanding Section 10(a)(ii) hereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested that an indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless (A) such failure to reimburse the indemnified party is based on a dispute with a good faith basis as to either the obligation of the indemnifying party arising under this Section 10 to indemnify the indemnified party or the amount of such obligation and (B) the indemnifying party shall have notified the indemnified party of such good faith dispute prior to the date of such settlement.
     SECTION 11. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 10 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the
Contribution
 
one hand, and MLV, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and of MLV, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative benefits received by the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and MLV, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by MLV from the sale of Securities on behalf of the Company.
     The relative fault of the Company and the Operating Partnership, on the one hand, and MLV, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Operating Partnership or by MLV and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     Each of the Company, the Operating Partnership and MLV agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 11 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 11. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 11 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 11, MLV shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by it to the public as agent or principal were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which MLV has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 11, each director, officer, employee or affiliate of MLV and each person, if any who controls MLV within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as MLV, and each officer and director of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
 
20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the preceding two paragraphs.
     For purposes of this Section 11, the Company and the Operating Partnership shall be deemed one party, jointly and severally liable for any obligations hereunder.
     SECTION 12. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of MLV or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company or the Operating Partnership, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to MLV.

     Re: Offering of Class Z Preferred Stock
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special Maryland counsel to Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and have been requested to render this opinion in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Company (Registration No. 333-173503) (the "Registration Statement"), prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 14, 2011 and which became effective on April 14, 2011, including the preliminary prospectus included therein at the time the Registration Statement was declared effective (the "Base Prospectus"), for offering by the Company of up to 4,000,000 shares (the "Shares") of 7.00% Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company pursuant to an At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement, dated August 24, 2011 (the "Sales Agreement"), among McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, on the one hand, and the Company and AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Company Partnership"), on the other hand. This opinion is being provided at your request in connection with the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K and supplements our opinion, dated April 14, 2011, previously filed as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement.
     In rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have reviewed the following documents (the "Documents"):
     (a) the charter of the Company (the "Charter"), certified by the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "SDAT");
     (b) the Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), as in effect on the date hereof, as certified by an officer of the Company;
     (c) the Sales Agreement;
     (d) the Registration Statement;
     (e) the base prospectus, dated April 14, 2011 (the "Base Prospectus"), which forms a part of the Registration Statement, and the prospectus supplement, filed by the Company with the Commission on April 14, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus");
 
August 24, 2011 Page 2
Apartment Investment and Management Company
     (f) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the authorization and issuance of the Shares and the authorization of the Sales Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, certified by an officer of the Company;
     (g) a certificate of the SDAT as to the good standing of the Company, dated as of a recent date;
     (h) a certificate executed by an officer of the Company (the "Certificate"), dated as of the date hereof, as to certain factual matters; and
     (i) such other documents as we have considered necessary to the rendering of the opinion expressed below.
     In examining the Documents, and in rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following: (a) each of the parties to the Documents (other than the Company) has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents and each instrument, agreement, and other document executed in connection with the Documents to which such party is a signatory and each such party's (other than the Company's) obligations set forth in the Documents, are its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms; (b) each person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document on behalf of any such party (other than the Company) is duly authorized to do so; (c) each natural person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document is legally competent to do so; (d) the Documents accurately describe and contain the mutual understandings of the parties, there are no oral or written modifications of or amendments or supplements to the Documents and there has been no waiver of any of the provisions of the Documents by actions or conduct of the parties or otherwise; and (e) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or telecopies or portable document file (".PDF") copies conform to the original documents (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), all signatures on all documents submitted to us for examination (and including signatures on photocopies, telecopies and .PDF copies) are genuine, and all public records reviewed are accurate and complete. As to certain factual matters we have relied on the Certificate as to the factual matters set forth therein, which we assume to be accurate and complete.
     We further assume that the issuance, sale, amount, and terms of Shares to be offered from time to time by the Company will be authorized and determined at the time of issuance by proper action of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof (each, a "Board Action") in accordance with the Company's Charter and Bylaws and applicable law.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof, upon due authorization by Board Action of an issuance of Shares, the Shares when issued and sold by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement and pursuant to one or more Placement Notices issued in accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, will be duly authorized, and when issued and delivered to and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement and any such Placement Notice, the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
     The opinion set forth herein is subject to additional assumptions, qualifications, and limitations as follows:
 
August 24, 2011 Page 3
Apartment Investment and Management Company
     (a) We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Maryland.
     (b) This opinion concerns only the effect of the laws (exclusive of the principles of conflict of laws) of the State of Maryland as currently in effect. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if any facts or circumstances come to our attention after the date hereof that might change this opinion.
     (c) We express no opinion as to compliance with the securities (or "blue sky") laws or the real estate syndication laws of the State of Maryland.
     (d) We assume that the issuance of the Shares by the Company will not cause any person to violate any of the provisions of the Charter relating to the Initial Holder Limit, the Look-Through Ownership Limit, or the Ownership Limit (as those terms are defined in the Charter) and that the Company will not issue any shares of capital stock other than the Shares.
     (e) This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K and to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Shares. In giving our consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

Exhibit 8.1
Apartment Investment and Management Company 4582 S. Ulster Street Parkway Suite 1100 Denver, Colorado 80237
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     You have requested our opinion concerning certain U.S. federal income tax considerations in connection with the offering (the "Offering"), from time to time, by Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("AIMCO"), of shares of AIMCO's Class Z Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Securities"), pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-173503) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 14, 2011 (the "Registration Statement"), the base prospectus dated as of April 14, 2011 (the "Base Prospectus"), and the prospectus supplement dated as of August 24, 2011 (the "Prospectus Supplement," and together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"). All capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise specified, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Prospectus.
     In connection with the Offering and with certain previous offerings of AIMCO stock and securities, we have acted as counsel to AIMCO, and we have assisted in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and certain other documents. In formulating our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and such other documentation and information provided by AIMCO as is relevant to the Offering and necessary to prepare the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In connection with our
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company August 24, 2011 Page 2
opinion, you have provided us with certain representations and covenants of officers of AIMCO relating to, among other things, properties, assets, income, distributions, stockholder ownership, organizational structure and other requirements, and the past, present and future conduct of AIMCO's business operations. We have assumed that such statements, representations and covenants are true as of the date hereof, and will continue to be true, without regard to any qualification as to knowledge and belief. For purposes of our opinion, we have not assumed any responsibility for investigating or independently verifying the facts and representations set forth in such documents, the partnership agreements and organizational documents for each of the corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies in which AIMCO holds a direct or indirect interest (the "Subsidiaries"), the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any other document, and we have not undertaken any independent review of such information. In particular, we note that AIMCO engages in transactions in connection with which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware. We have, consequently, assumed and relied on AIMCO's representations that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion.
     In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the foregoing documents have been or will be consummated in accordance with the operative documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, our opinion is based on the correctness of the assumption that there have been no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or any other state under the laws of which any of the Subsidiaries have been formed. In rendering our opinion, we have also considered and relied upon the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations"), administrative rulings and the other interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service, all as they exist as of the date hereof. It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect). Any change which is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions herein. There can be no assurances, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court.
     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we are of the opinion that:
     1.     Commencing with AIMCO's initial taxable year ended December 31, 1994, AIMCO was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable, AIMCO to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. AIMCO's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, certain requirements including requirements relating to distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification
 
Apartment Investment and Management Company August 24, 2011 Page 3
tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of AIMCO's operation for any particular taxable year satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
     2.     Although the discussion set forth in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," as supplemented by the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," does not purport to discuss all possible U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Securities, the discussion, although general in nature, constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary under current law of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Securities by a holder who acquires such Securities, subject to the qualifications set forth therein. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Securities by an investor will depend upon that holder's particular situation, and we express no opinion as to the completeness of the discussion set forth in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," as supplemented by the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," as applied to any particular holder.
     Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to AIMCO or to any investment therein.
     This opinion has been prepared for you in connection with the transaction described herein. It may not be relied upon by anyone else without our prior written consent. We consent to AIMCO filing this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Base Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
