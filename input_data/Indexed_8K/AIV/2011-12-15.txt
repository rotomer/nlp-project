The New Credit Agreement provides for $500 million of revolving commitments, which includes a $100 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $100 million sublimit for swing line loans. In addition, the Borrowers have the ability from time to time to increase the aggregate revolving commitments by up to an additional $200 million in the aggregate, subject to the receipt of additional revolving commitments. The revolving commitments will expire on December 13, 2014 and may be extended for an additional year on two occasions, subject to certain conditions, including payment of a 25.0 basis point fee on the aggregate revolving commitments. Proceeds borrowed under the New Credit Facility were used to refinance the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below) and may be used to fund working capital and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions, development and redevelopment of properties, restricted payments, and the refinancing of existing and future indebtedness.
The New Credit Agreement replaces the Borrowers' existing $300 million revolving credit facility, dated as of November 2, 2004 (as amended, the "Existing Credit Facility"), among the Borrowers, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer, and KeyBank National Association, as syndication agent. The Existing Credit Facility was set to expire on May 1, 2013 (with a one year option to extend).
Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Borrowers' option, at (a) a base rate (defined as the greatest of (x) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (y) KeyBank National Association's prime rate and (z) one month LIBOR plus 1.25%) plus an applicable margin, which is initially 1.50% or (b) LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is initially 2.75%. The applicable margins are subject to adjustment according to the Borrowers' Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the New Credit Agreement), as specified in the New Credit Agreement.
The New Credit Agreement includes, among other terms and conditions standard for transactions of this type, limitations (subject to specified exclusions) on the ability of the Borrowers and their subsidiaries to incur debt; create liens; make investments, loans and advances; engage in certain mergers and consolidations; make distributions and dividends; and engage in transactions with affiliates. The New Credit Agreement also requires the Borrowers to be in compliance at the end of each fiscal quarter with a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, a Debt Service Coverage Ratio, a Secured Indebtedness Ratio, a Leverage Ratio, a Variable Rate Debt Ratio, a minimum level of Adjusted Tangible Net Worth and maximum levels of Total Funded Indebtedness, Aggregate Recourse Debt, Mezzanine Indebtedness and Total Unsecured Indebtedness (as each such term is defined in the New Credit Agreement).
The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including nonpayment of principal and other amounts when due; breach of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties; cross-default and/or cross-acceleration to other material indebtedness of the Borrowers or their subsidiaries; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; material judgments against any Loan Party (as such term is defined in the New Credit Agreement) which are not stayed within 30 days; certain ERISA events; actual or asserted invalidity of any loan document; and a change of control. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the New Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder may, among other things, terminate their obligations under the New Credit Agreement and require the Borrowers to repay all amounts owed thereunder.
The description of the New Credit Agreement above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Credit Agreement, which is attached as 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
On December 13, 2011, Aimco issued a press release in connection with the entering into of the New Credit Agreement. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by this reference.

Refinancing of Swing Line Loans
(i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrowers (which hereby irrevocably authorize the Swing Line Lender to so request on their behalf), that each Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrowers with a copy of the applicable Revolving Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Revolving Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 4:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Revolving Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrowers in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.
(ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.
(iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period
 
from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(iv) Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, (C) any Lender being a Defaulting Lender or (D) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; , , that each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided herein.

Repayment of Participations
(i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.
(ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
(e) . The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrowers for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender's Applicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.
Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender
(f) . The Borrowers shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.

Borrower Information

(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) the applicable Note(s), which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent's Clawback.
(a) . All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is
General
 
owed, at the Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 3:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b)(i) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrowers and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the Borrowers for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan included in such Revolving Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
 
A notice by the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrowers with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
(d) . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).
Obligations of Lenders Several
(e) . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders.
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and other amounts owing them, that:

provided
(a) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
 
(b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as this Agreement may be amended from time to time) (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral as provided for in Section 2.14 or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Revolving Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
Each Loan Party party hereto consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
2.14 Cash Collateral.
(a) . If an L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit issued by it and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, then upon the request of the Administrative Agent, Borrowers shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations; that so long as no Event of Default exists, any such Cash Collateral will be released to the Borrowers upon payment in full of such L/C Borrowing. Additionally, if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, the Borrowers shall immediately (i) Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, or (ii) to the extent approved by the applicable L/C Issuer (to which an L/C Obligation is owed) in its sole discretion, if the Commitments are replaced with a new revolving facility, cause "back to back" letters of credit with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer to be issued; , , if Borrowers have delivered a notice pursuant to Section 2.16(a) extending the Maturity Date, Borrowers shall not be required to so Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of the applicable L/C Obligations or so cause such "back to back" letters of credit to be issued until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (after giving effect to such extension of the Maturity Date). At any time there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one (1) Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers' Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.15 and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender).

(iii) the Borrowers pay the Lenders an extension fee on the Existing Maturity Date in an amount equal to the product of (x) 0.25%, multiplied by (y) the Commitments then in effect at the time of the extension.

Conflicting Provisions
2.17 Increase in Commitments.
(a) .
Increase in Commitments
(i) . Provided there exists no Default or Event of Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrowers may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments of up to (for all such requests) $200,000,000; that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000. Such notice shall indicate the proposed Applicable Rate (or other applicable interest rate margins) for such new Commitments. In the event new Commitments are to be provided, no consent of any Lender shall be required in connection with the issuance of any such new Commitments, regardless of whether the Applicable Rate (or other applicable interest rate margins) for such new Commitments or Revolving Loans is less than or greater than that for any other Commitments or Revolving Loans hereunder.
Request for Increase
provided
(ii) . In no event shall any Lender be obligated to provide an additional Commitment.
Lender Elections to Increase
(iii) . Increases in Aggregate Commitments may be provided by Lenders or Eligible Assignees. Increases in Aggregate Commitments may be effected pursuant to a Joinder Agreement or amendment to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
Additional Lenders
(iv) . If the Aggregate Commitments are increased or if new Commitments are provided in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the "") and the final allocation of such increase or new Commitments under this clause (a). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase or new Commitments and the Increase Effective Date. Any such increase or new Commitments may be drawn on upon the satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02.
Effective Date and Allocations
Increase Effective Date
(v) . As a condition precedent to such increase or new Commitments under this clause (a), the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrowers dated as of the Increase Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrowers (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each Borrower approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the
Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase
 
Borrowers, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, to the knowledge of Borrowers (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects, on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case, to the knowledge of the Borrowers, they are true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.17, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default exists. The Borrowers shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments under this Section (which prepayments will not be on a pro rata basis with respect to the outstanding Commitments prior to the effectiveness of any such increase). Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Borrowers may borrow from the Lenders providing such increase in the Commitments (on a non pro rata basis with Lenders not providing such increase) in order to fund such prepayment. The Administrative Agent and the Borrowers may, without the consent of any Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to effect the increase in Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.17(a), including, without limitation, establishing pricing, commitment fees and the maturity of any new commitments, incorporation of a new revolving tranche and amendments in respect of borrowing and prepayment procedures for any new revolving tranche.
(b) . This Section 2.17 shall supersede any provisions in Sections 2.13 or 10.01 to the contrary.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender or an L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of such amounts, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Evidence of Payments
(e) . Any Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrowers are resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or Lender, if requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Status of Lenders
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrowers are resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Person becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Person is legally entitled to do so), and upon a change in circumstances requiring the delivery of new forms and/or documentation, whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

(iv) in the case of any Administrative Agent, Lender or L/C Issuer that is a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service W-9, establishing a complete exemption from backup withholding taxes; , , that such a Person that the Borrowers are entitled to treat as an "exempt recipient" (without regard to whether any Borrower has requested any certificates or forms in this respect) shall not be required to provide such form, and/or
provided
however
(v) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Sections 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(f) . If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrowers an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrowers, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer, agree to repay the amount paid over to the Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
 
3.02 Illegality.
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.03 Inability to Determine Rates.
If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans.
(a) . If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs Generally
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)) or any L/C Issuer;
 
(ii) subject any Lender or any L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or such L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax ); or
(iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into or continuing or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) . If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrowers shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof (accompanied by reasonable back-up documentation).
Certificates for Reimbursement
 
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or such L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
(e) . The Borrowers shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; , the Borrowers shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.
Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans
provided
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
3.05 Compensation for Losses.
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by the Borrowers (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurodollar Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrowers; or
(c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 10.13;
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained (but excluding any loss relating to the Applicable Rate or anticipated profits). The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
 
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate used in determining the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Designation of a Different Lending Office
(b) . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.
Replacement of Lenders
. All of the Borrowers' obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

(f) .
Joint and Several Liability of Borrowers
(i) Each of Borrowers is accepting joint and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of Borrowers and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the Obligations.
(ii) Each of Borrowers, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including, without limitation, any Obligations arising under this Section 10.18), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them.
(iii) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.
(iv) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 10.18 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each such Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever.
(v) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any Loans issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default, Event of Default, or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent or Lenders under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement). Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by the Administrative Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by the Administrative
 
Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section 10.18 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 10.18, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such Borrower under this Section 10.18 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 10.18 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any Borrower or the Administrative Agent or Lender. The joint and several liability of each Borrower hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change whatsoever in the name, constitution or place of formation of any of the Borrowers or Administrative Agent or Lenders.
(vi) The provisions of this Section 10.18 are made for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Administrative Agent, or any Lender, successor or assign first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 10.18 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 10.18 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.
(vii) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to the Administrative Agent or Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may have against the other Borrowers with respect to any payments to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Documents are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, including without limitation, as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to the other Borrowers therefor.
 
Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or fiduciary duty to the Borrowers, the Guarantors or their respective Subsidiaries arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, and the relationship between each Lender and Administrative Agent, and the Borrowers and the Guarantors is solely that of a lender and borrower, and nothing contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents shall in any manner be construed as making the parties hereto partners, joint venturers or any other relationship other than lender and borrower.
