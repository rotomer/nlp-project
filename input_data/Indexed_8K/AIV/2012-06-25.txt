Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Underwriting Agreement
On June 21, 2012, Apartment Investment and Management Company (the "Company"), AIMCO Properties, L.P., the operating partnership through which the Company conducts its real estate activities (the "Operating Partnership"), Terry Considine ("Mr. Considine") and Titaho Limited Partnership RLLLP (together with Mr. Considine, the "Selling Stockholders"), entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (collectively, the "Underwriters") relating to an underwritten public offering (the "Offering") of (i) 9,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock") issued and sold by the Company, and (ii) 2,041,934 shares of Common Stock sold by the Selling Stockholders, which were acquired upon exercise of stock options. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company also granted the Underwriters an option to purchase up to 1,350,000 additional shares of Common Stock, exercisable within 30 days of the date of the Underwriting Agreement.
The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification provisions and closing conditions. The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company estimates that its net proceeds from the Offering will be approximately $240.5 million. If the Underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, the Company's net proceeds will be approximately $276.6 million. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders, but will receive $47.0 million as payment of the exercise price of the stock options by the Selling Stockholders. The Company intends to use its net proceeds from this Offering, along with available cash, to redeem all outstanding shares of its Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock. The Offering is expected to close on June 26, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions.
On June 21, 2012, the Company issued a press release announcing the pricing of the Offering. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Underwriters and their affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for the Company from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for the Company in the ordinary course of their businesses for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve the Company's securities and instruments. In addition, the Underwriters each have an affiliate that is a lender under the Company's revolving credit facility.

As used herein, a "Repayment Event" means any event or condition which gives the holder of any note, debenture or other evidence of indebtedness (or any person acting on such holder's behalf) the right to require the repurchase, redemption or repayment of all or a portion of such indebtedness by the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Significant Subsidiary.
(p) No filing with, or authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or decree of, any court or governmental authority or agency is necessary or required for the performance by the Company or the Operating Partnership of their respective obligations hereunder, in connection with the offering, issuance or sale of the Securities hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such as have already been obtained or will be obtained under the Act or under state securities laws or the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

Each of the properties of any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Subsidiaries complies with all applicable codes and zoning laws and regulations except in any case where such non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; and none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary has knowledge of any pending or threatened condemnation, zoning change or other proceeding or action that will in any manner affect the size of, use of, improvements on, construction on, or access to the properties of any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary except in any case where such action or proceeding would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All of the leases and subleases material to the business of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, and under which the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary holds properties described in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, are in full force and effect, and none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary has any notice of any material claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to the rights of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary under any of the leases or subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the rights of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary of the continued possession of the leased or subleased premises under any such lease or sublease, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, except as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, no tenant under any lease to which the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary leases any portion of its property is in default under such lease, except for any defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(t) Title insurance in favor of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries has been obtained with respect to each property owned by any such entity in an amount that is customary for companies engaged in the same or similar businesses, except where the failure to maintain such title insurance would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(u) The mortgages and deeds of trust encumbering the properties and assets described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (i) are not convertible (in the absence of foreclosure) into an equity interest in the
 
property or asset described therein or in the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary, nor does any of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Subsidiary hold a participating interest therein, (ii) except as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, are not cross-defaulted to any indebtedness other than indebtedness of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries and (iii) are not cross-collateralized to any property not owned by the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of the Subsidiaries, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(v) To the knowledge of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the real property of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries is free of material structural defects and all building systems contained therein are in reasonably good working order in all material respects, subject to ordinary wear and tear or, strategic business decisions regarding maintenance thereof.
(w) All U.S. federal income tax returns of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries required by law to be filed have been filed and all taxes shown by such returns, which are due and payable, have been paid. No assessment in respect of U.S. federal income taxes has been made to date against the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of the Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries have filed all other tax returns that are required to have been filed by them pursuant to applicable foreign, state, local or other law except insofar as the failure to file such returns would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries, except for such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith or would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries in respect of any income, partnership and corporation tax liability for any years not finally determined are adequate to meet any assessments or re-assessments for additional income tax for any years not finally determined, except to the extent of any inadequacy that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(x) Commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 1994, the Company has been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a real estate investment trust (a "REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Company's actual and proposed method of operation as described in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus will enable it to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. The Operating Partnership will be taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and
(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
(f) Each Selling Stockholder shall have furnished to the Underwriters a certificate, signed by such Selling Stockholder, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the representations and warranties of such Selling Stockholder in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date to the same effect as if made on the Closing Date.
(g) The Company shall have requested and caused Ernst & Young LLP to have furnished to the Underwriters, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters, (which may refer to letters previously delivered to the Underwriters), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.

business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Underwriters, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof), the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
(i) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.
(j) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Selling Stockholders shall have furnished to the Underwriters such further information, certificates and documents as the Underwriters may reasonably request.

st

7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or any Selling Stockholder to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters on demand for all expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. If the Company is required to make any payments to the Underwriters under this Section 7 because of any Selling Stockholder's refusal, inability or failure to satisfy any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6, the Selling Stockholders in proportion to the percentage of Securities to be sold by each Selling Stockholder shall reimburse the Company on demand for all amounts so paid.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
pro rata
8. . (a) The Company and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Securities, the Final Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company and the Operating Partnership will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company or the Operating Partnership may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Selling Stockholder severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents of
 
each Underwriter and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each other Selling Stockholder, if any, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Selling Stockholder may otherwise have.
(c) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Operating Partnership, each of their directors, each of their officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each Selling Stockholder, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to the Underwriters furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company, the Operating Partnership and the Selling Stockholders acknowledge that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting," the paragraph related to stabilization and syndicate covering transactions in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying
provided
however
 
party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
(e) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending the same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Operating Partnership, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, the Operating Partnership, the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Operating Partnership, jointly and severally, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company, the Operating Partnership and by the Selling Stockholders shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by each of them, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The
provided
however
 
Company, the Operating Partnership, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (e), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company or the Operating Partnership within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or the Operating Partnership who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and the Operating Partnership shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Operating Partnership, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (e).
(e) The liability of each Selling Stockholder under such Selling Stockholder's representations and warranties contained in Section 1 hereof and under the indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 8 shall be limited to an amount equal to the initial public offering price of the Securities sold by such Selling Stockholder to the Underwriters. The Company and the Selling Stockholders may agree, as among themselves and without limiting the rights of the Underwriters under this Agreement, as to the respective amounts of such liability for which they each shall be responsible.
9. . If any Underwriter shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriter shall be obligated to take up and pay for the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriter shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriter does not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Selling Stockholders, the Operating Partnership or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Underwriters shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Selling Stockholders and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Underwriter

11. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers, of each Selling Stockholder and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any Selling Stockholder or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, affiliates agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

LLC (collectively, the "Underwriters") on the one hand, and the Company, AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, Mr. Terry Considine ("Mr. Considine") and Titaho Limited Partnership RLLLP, a registered limited liability partnership (Titaho Limited Partnership RLLLP and Mr. Considine are collectively referred to herein as the "Selling Stockholders"), on the other hand.

(a) the charter of the Company (the "Charter"), certified by the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the "SDAT");

(d) the Registration Statement;
(e) the Prospectus;
(f) resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the authorization and issuance of the Shares and the authorization of the Underwriting Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, certified by an officer of the Company;
(g) a certificate of the SDAT as to the good standing of the Company, dated as of a recent date;
(h) a certificate executed by an officer of the Company (the "Certificate"), dated as of the date hereof, as to certain factual matters; and
(i) such other documents as we have considered necessary to the rendering of the opinion expressed below.
In examining the Documents, and in rendering the opinion set forth below, we have assumed the following: (a) each of the parties to the Documents (other than the Company) has duly and validly executed and delivered each of the Documents and each instrument, agreement, and other document executed in connection with the Documents to which such party is a signatory and each such party's (other than the Company's) obligations set forth in the Documents, are its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms; (b) each person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document on behalf of any such party (other than the Company) is duly authorized to do so; (c) each natural person executing any such instrument, agreement or other document is legally competent to do so; (d) the Documents accurately describe and contain the mutual understandings of the parties, there are no oral or written modifications of or amendments or supplements to the Documents and there has been no waiver of any of the provisions of the Documents by actions or conduct of the parties or otherwise; and (e) all documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies or telecopies or portable document file (".PDF") copies conform to the original documents (and the authenticity of the originals of such copies), all signatures on all documents submitted to us for examination (and including signatures on photocopies, telecopies and .PDF copies) are genuine, and all public records reviewed are accurate and complete. As to certain factual matters we have relied on the Certificate as to the factual matters set forth therein, which we assume to be accurate and complete.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations we deem relevant, we are of the opinion that, as of the date hereof:
(1) The Company Shares have been duly authorized and upon issuance and delivery against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
(2) The Selling Stockholder Shares to be sold by the Selling Stockholders have been duly authorized and, when issued upon exercise by each of the Selling Stockholders' Stock Options (the "Stock Options") in accordance with the terms of the respective Incentive Stock Option Agreements and Nonqualified Stock Option Agreements (collectively, the "Stock Option Grant Agreements") and the Company's 1997 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "Stock Option Plan"), will be validly issued, fully

paid and non-assessable, assuming that (a) the Company received the requisite consideration upon exercise of such Stock Options and (b) such issuance of Selling Stockholder Shares by the Company to the Selling Stockholders otherwise complied with the provisions of the Stock Option Plan, Stock Option Grant Agreements and the Charter.
The opinion set forth herein is subject to additional assumptions, qualifications, and limitations as follows:
(a) We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Maryland. To the extent that any documents referred to herein are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland, we have assumed that the laws of such jurisdiction are the same as the laws of the State of Maryland.
(b) We further assume that the issuance and sale of the Shares will not cause the Company to exceed the total limit of the authorized capital stock of the Company, as provided in the Charter.
(c) This opinion concerns only the effect of the laws (exclusive of the principles of conflict of laws) of the State of Maryland as currently in effect. We assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after the date hereof or if any facts or circumstances come to our attention after the date hereof that might change this opinion.
(d) We express no opinion as to compliance with the securities (or "blue sky") laws or the real estate syndication laws of the State of Maryland.
(e) We assume that the issuance of the Shares by the Company will not cause any person to violate any of the provisions of the Charter relating to the Initial Holder Limit, the Look-Through Ownership Limit or the Ownership Limit (as those terms are defined in the Charter) and that the Company will not issue any shares of capital stock other than the Shares.
(f) This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K and to the reference to our firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Shares. In giving our consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion concerning certain U.S. federal income tax considerations in connection with the offering (the "Offering") of up to 12,391,934 shares of Class A common stock (the "Class A Common Stock") of Apartment Investment and Management Company, a Maryland corporation ("AIMCO"), pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-173503) filed by AIMCO with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on April 14, 2011 (such Registration Statement, as so amended, the "Registration Statement"), the prospectus, dated April 14, 2011, included with the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"), the preliminary prospectus supplement dated June 20, 2012 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement") and the prospectus supplement dated June 25, 2012 (together with the Base Prospectus and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the "Prospectus"). All capitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise specified, shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Prospectus.
In connection with the Offering and with certain previous offerings of AIMCO stock and securities, we have acted as counsel to AIMCO, and we have assisted in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and certain other documents. In formulating our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and such other documentation and information provided by AIMCO as is relevant to the Offering and
Apartment Investment and Management Company

necessary to prepare the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In addition, AIMCO has provided us with certain representations and covenants of officers of AIMCO relating to, among other things, properties, assets, income, distributions, stockholder ownership, organizational structure and other requirements, and the past, present and future conduct of AIMCO's business operations. We have assumed that such statements, representations and covenants are true as of the date hereof, and will continue to be true, without regard to any qualification as to knowledge and belief. For purposes of our opinion, we have not assumed any responsibility for investigating or independently verifying the facts and representations set forth in such documents, the partnership agreements and organizational documents for each of the corporations, partnerships and limited liability companies in which AIMCO holds a direct or indirect interest (the "Subsidiaries"), the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any other document, and we have not undertaken any independent review of such information. In particular, we note that AIMCO engages in transactions in connection with which we have not provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware. We have, consequently, assumed and relied on AIMCO's representations that the information presented in such documents or otherwise furnished to us accurately and completely describes all material facts relevant to our opinion.
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that the transactions contemplated by the foregoing documents have been or will be consummated in accordance with the operative documents, and that such documents accurately reflect the material facts of such transactions. In addition, our opinion is based on the correctness of the assumption that there have been no changes in the applicable laws of the State of Maryland or any other state under the laws of which any of the Subsidiaries have been formed. In rendering our opinion, we have also considered and relied upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations"), administrative rulings and other interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal Revenue Service, all as they exist as of the date hereof. It should be noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations are subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect). Any change which is made after the date hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our conclusions herein. There can be no assurances, moreover, that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court.
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, for U.S. federal income tax purposes we are of the opinion that:
1. Commencing with AIMCO's initial taxable year ended December 31, 1994, AIMCO was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its actual method of operation has enabled, and its proposed method of operation will enable, AIMCO to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. AIMCO's qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through

actual annual operating results, certain requirements including requirements relating to distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of AIMCO's operation for any particular taxable year satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
2. Although the discussion set forth in the Base Prospectus under the caption "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" does not purport to discuss all possible U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Class A Common Stock, the discussion, although general in nature, constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary under current law of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Class A Common Stock by a holder who acquires such Class A Common Stock, subject to the qualifications set forth therein. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Class A Common Stock by an investor will depend upon that holder's particular situation, and we express no opinion as to the completeness of the discussion set forth in "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations" as applied to any particular holder.
Other than as expressly stated above, we express no opinion on any issue relating to AIMCO or to any investment therein.
This opinion has been prepared for you in connection with the transaction described herein. We consent to the reference to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations of the Commission. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements related to the completion, timing and size of the proposed offering of securities by Aimco and the use of net proceeds therefrom. These forward-looking statements are based on management's judgment as of this date and include certain risks and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Aimco's ability to maintain current or meet projected occupancy, rental rates and property operating results. Actual results may differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements and, in addition, will be affected by a variety of risks and factors, some of which are beyond the control of Aimco, including, without limitation: financing risks, including the availability and cost of capital markets financing and the risk that our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; earnings may not be sufficient to maintain compliance with debt covenants; real estate risks, including fluctuations in real estate values and the general economic climate in the markets in which we operate and competition for residents in such markets; national and local economic conditions, including the pace of job growth and the level of unemployment; the terms of governmental regulations that affect Aimco and interpretations of those regulations; the competitive environment in which Aimco operates; the timing of acquisitions and dispositions; insurance risk, including the cost of insurance; natural disasters and severe weather such as hurricanes; litigation, including costs associated with prosecuting or defending claims and any adverse outcomes; energy costs; and possible environmental liabilities, including costs, fines or penalties that may be incurred due to necessary remediation of contamination of properties presently owned or previously owned by Aimco.
In addition, our current and continuing qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and depends on our ability to meet the various requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, through actual operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership.
Readers should carefully review Aimco's financial statements and notes thereto, as well as the risk factors described in Aimco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and the other documents Aimco files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
