Aimco Reports Second Quarter 2012 Results
Denver, Colorado, August 2, 2012
- Apartment Investment and Management Company (Aimco) (NYSE: AIV) announced today its second quarter 2012 results.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: Aimco enjoyed an excellent second quarter with solid progress on all fronts. Our business remains good with steady customer demand driving higher rents. Our portfolio continues to improve with the sale of lower-rated properties funding accretive redevelopments. Our balance sheet is stronger by $642 million raised in two equity offerings, and the subsequent redemption of $601 million of preferred stock. Our prospects are good as we enter the second half of the year; our Board of Directors agrees, and has increased Aimco's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.20 per share.
Chief Financial Officer Ernie Freedman adds: Aimco's recent equity activities, including our common stock offerings and preferred stock redemptions, and the common dividend increase, are expected to increase net annual cash flows by $18 million, and to increase annualized Pro forma FFO and AFFO by $0.04 and $0.12 per share, respectively. These activities have also accelerated progress toward our balance sheet targets. We now expect to achieve our stated Debt and Preferred Stock to EBITDA target of 7.0x in early 2014, or almost two years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of this year, and our EBITDA to Interest and Preferred Stock Dividends target of 2.5x even sooner.
Financial Results
Second Quarter Pro forma FFO Up 10%, AFFO Up 17%
Second quarter and year-to-date 2011 financial results include a deduction of $0.15 per share related to debt prepayment penalties and write-off of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with a refinancing and securitization transaction during that period. Excluding these charges, comparable second quarter and year-to-date Pro forma FFO and AFFO were $0.42 per share and $0.29 per share, respectively.
Pro forma FFO
- Pro forma FFO increased 10% when compared to second quarter 2011, excluding the charges described above. Increased Pro forma FFO is the result of: improved property operating results; additional income generated by investments in partnership tenders and mergers; and interest expense savings due to refinancing maturing property debt at lower average interest rates. Pro forma FFO exceeded the high end of Aimco's guidance for the quarter by $0.03 per share, primarily due to higher than expected property revenue growth, lower than anticipated property expenses, and lower than anticipated casualty losses.
Adjusted Funds from Operations
- AFFO increased 17% when compared to second quarter 2011, excluding the charges described above. Capital Replacements continue to decline year-over-year in line with the reduced number of apartment units as Aimco's portfolio is concentrated in fewer properties, generating AFFO growth in excess of Pro forma FFO growth.
Property Operations
Aimco's property operations consist primarily of Conventional real estate operations, which relate to Aimco's diversified portfolio of market-rate apartment communities and include Same Store Properties, Redevelopment Properties, Acquisition Properties and Other Properties.
Aimco also operates a portfolio of Affordable Properties. Aimco's Affordable real estate operations consist of properties with rents that are generally paid, in whole or in part, by a government agency. Over the next four to five years, Aimco expects to dispose of these properties and reinvest capital in its Conventional portfolio.
In order to ensure comparability between periods, property operating results below are based on Aimco's ownership interest as of June 30, 2012. See the Glossary for definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
Total Same Store NOI Up 6.1% for Second Quarter and Year-Over-Year
Conventional Same Store Results
Rental Rates Rising
Affordable Same Store Results
- For second quarter 2012, average month-end occupancy for the Affordable portfolio was 98.6%, an increase of 0.9% from second quarter 2011, while average revenue per unit increased 3.4% from $935 to $967 per unit.
Refer to Supplemental Schedules 6a through 6d for additional details on Conventional Same Store operating results.
Portfolio Management
Aimco's portfolio strategy focuses on B/B+ quality conventional apartment communities located in the largest U.S. markets as measured by total apartment value.
Aimco measures Conventional Property asset quality based on average rents compared to local market average rents as reported by REIS, a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance information and analysis. Aimco defines asset quality as follows: A-quality assets are those with rents greater than 125% of local market average; B-quality assets are those with rents 90% to 125% of local market average; and C-quality assets are those with rents less than 90% of local market average. For first quarter 2012, the most recent period for which REIS information is available, Aimco's Conventional Property rents averaged approximately 101% of local market average rents, down from 102% in fourth quarter 2011.
Aimco's target markets are primarily coastal markets, and also include several Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois. In executing Aimco's portfolio strategy, the company expects to sell each year the lowest-rated 5% to 10% of its portfolio and to invest the proceeds from such sales in higher-quality properties in its target markets through redevelopment and acquisitions.
By selling each year the lowest-rated 5% to 10% of its portfolio, Aimco expects its year-end portfolio average revenue per unit to increase at a rate that is approximately 4% to 5% greater than annual market rent growth.
Conventional Property Revenue per Unit Up 8.1% to $1,290
Second quarter 2012 Conventional portfolio average revenue per unit was $1,290, an 8.1% increase compared to second quarter 2011, as a result of year-over-year revenue growth of 4.7% and the sale of Conventional Properties during 2011 and 2012 with average revenues per unit substantially lower than those of the retained portfolio.
Aimco expects fourth quarter 2012 Conventional portfolio revenue per unit to average approximately $1,370, an increase of 9% compared to fourth quarter 2011, with approximately half of the increase generated by market rent growth and half the result of sales of lower-rent properties.
Dispositions
- In second quarter 2012, Aimco sold five Conventional Properties and 11 Affordable Properties with 1,151 and 1,082 units, respectively, for $122.4 million in gross proceeds. Average revenue per unit for the Conventional Properties sold during the quarter was $825, compared to the retained portfolio average of $1,290 per unit. Aimco's share of net sales proceeds after distributions to limited partners, repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was $48.3 million.
During 2012, Aimco expects to continue to upgrade its portfolio by selling more than 25 Conventional Properties and more than 60 Affordable Properties.  Aimco has discussed previously the potential acceleration of portfolio upgrades by selling in 2012 properties otherwise expected to be sold in 2013 and 2014.  Aimco's portfolio strategy and targets remain unchanged and these properties continue to be listed for sale in portfolios and/or as individual asset sales.  With the recent redemptions of its high-cost preferred stocks, an immediate use of proceeds from such an acceleration of future sales no longer exists; however, should an opportunity arise to put to use proceeds from sales of these assets on a value-accretive basis, Aimco will give further consideration to accelerating its disposition plans.
Acquisitions
- During the second quarter, Aimco acquired for $38.9 million a 42-unit property located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. The acquisition was funded in part using $20.0 million of newly placed non-recourse property debt with a 3.95% fixed interest rate, and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower-rated properties. The property's average revenue per unit is approximately $4,000, and its average rents are approximately 38% greater than the local market average.
See Supplemental Schedules 7a and 7b for additional details regarding Aimco's Conventional portfolio quality and capital allocation, and Supplemental Schedule 8 for information related to disposition and acquisition activity.
Redevelopment
During the second quarter, Aimco began the construction of 28 new townhomes on a vacant land parcel at its Elm Creek property located in Chicago. Aimco expects to invest $9.9 million in the development and first occupancy is anticipated in the fourth quarter 2012. Current market rents for comparable product are estimated to average approximately $2,950 per unit.
During 2012, Aimco expects to invest $125 to $150 million in redevelopment projects at a total of ten properties. Construction is currently underway at five of these properties including: Elm Creek; Pacific Bay Vistas in San Bruno, California; The Palazzo in West Los Angeles; Flamingo South Beach in Miami; and Plantation Gardens in Plantation, Florida. Aimco completed Phase I of the redevelopment of Lincoln Place in Venice, California during the second quarter and expects to start Phases II and III during the second half of 2012. The projects at Flamingo South Beach and Plantation Gardens are expected to be completed by year-end.
During the balance of 2012, multi-year redevelopment projects are expected to begin at: 2900 on First in Seattle; Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center-City Philadelphia; and The Preserve at Marin in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over the next few years, Aimco expects to invest approximately $400 million in these ten projects and, based on current market rents, generate average initial cash returns greater than 7% and average Free Cash Flow Internal Rates of Return in excess of 10%.
See Supplemental Schedule 10 for additional details regarding Aimco's redevelopment activities.
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
Components of Aimco Leverage
Debt Ratios
Aimco's leverage targets are: Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA of less than 7.0x; and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends of greater than 2.5x. In measuring leverage, Aimco also focuses on Debt to EBITDA and EBITDA Coverage of Interest ratios. See the Glossary for definitions of these metrics.
2012 ratios are provided on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impacts of Aimco's equity activities in the second quarter and July.
Aimco made significant progress toward its stated leverage targets with the redemption of $300.9 million of preferred stock during the second quarter 2012, and redemption of an additional $300.0 million of preferred stock in July. As a result of these redemptions, Aimco now expects to achieve its leverage targets by early 2014, two years earlier than anticipated at the beginning of 2012. Future leverage reduction is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization from retained earnings.
Liquidity
Aimco's recourse debt at June 30, 2012, was limited to its revolving credit facility, which Aimco uses for working capital purposes and to secure letters of credit. At the end of second quarter, Aimco had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility and available capacity was $473.0 million, net of $27.0 million of letters of credit backed by the facility. At the end of the quarter, Aimco had on hand $312.9 million of unrestricted cash, $300.0 million of which was used to redeem preferred stock in July, and $65.1 million in unfunded commitments to fund redevelopment investments.
See Supplemental Schedule 4 for additional details about Aimco's non-recourse property debt and Supplemental Schedule 5 for information related to Aimco's preferred securities.
Equity Activity
Common Stock Offerings
- During second quarter 2012, Aimco completed two public offerings resulting in the sale of 20,794,200 shares of its Common Stock generating net proceeds of $558.6 million, or $26.86 per share. Additionally, pursuant to an option granted to underwriters of the June equity offering, Aimco sold in July 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of $36.1 million, or $26.74 per share. In connection with these Common Stock offerings, the holders of near-term expiring stock options exercised 2,041,934 stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $23.01 per option for proceeds to Aimco of $47.0 million. The shares received upon exercise were then sold by the stockholders as part of the public offerings described above. In total, Aimco issued 24.2 million shares of its Common Stock generating net proceeds of $641.7 million, or an average of $26.53 per share.
Preferred Stock Redemptions
- Also during second quarter, using the proceeds from the May equity offering, Aimco redeemed for $300.9 million all of the outstanding shares of its Class T, Class V, and Class Y Cumulative Preferred Stock. In connection with these redemptions, Aimco wrote off previously deferred issuance costs totaling $10.5 million. In June, Aimco called for redemption its Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock and, in July, using the proceeds from the June equity offering, Aimco redeemed all of the outstanding shares and wrote off an additional $10.1 million of previously deferred issuance costs, which will be recognized in the third quarter.
Dividend
- As announced on August 1, 2012, Aimco's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which, on an annualized basis, is a 67% increase compared to the dividends paid during 2011. The second quarter 2012 dividend is payable on August 31, 2012, to stockholders of record on August 17, 2012.
2012 Outlook
As described elsewhere in this Earnings Release, Aimco adds back to FFO preferred stock redemption related amounts in its computation of Pro forma FFO as well as AFFO.

GLOSSARY AND RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES
This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco's definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES:
Properties acquired since January 1, 2011.
ADJUSTED INTEREST EXPENSE:
Adjusted Interest Expense represents Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense less (i) prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs and (ii) the amount of interest income recognized by Aimco related to its investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding only Aimco property debt.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
Affordable Properties benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax credit equity, or rental assistance payments to the property owners. Under these programs, rent adjustments are made in accordance with property-specific contracts between Aimco and HUD, with rent increases generally based on an adjustment factor set by HUD annually.
AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP:
AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco's UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 95% of the common partnership units of the Aimco Operating Partnership.
AIMCO PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
Non-GAAP measures representing Aimco's share of financial information discussed in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information. Aimco's proportionate share of financial information includes Aimco's share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Proportionate reporting benefits the users of Aimco's financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable only to Aimco stockholders. Aimco also refers to this measure as Aimco's Share of financial information. See Supplemental Schedules 1, 3 and 4 for reconciliation of Aimco's proportionate share of financial results to Aimco's consolidated financial statements.
CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATION
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI):
CI includes all non-Redevelopment capital additions that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR):
Unlike CI, CR does not increase the useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CR represents the portion of capital additions that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR  is deducted in the calculation of AFFO.
CASUALTY CAPITAL ADDITIONS:
Casualty capital additions represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an asset after a casualty event such as a hurricane, tornado or flood.
Supplemental Schedule 9 contains capital additions information related to (1) residential properties that Aimco owns and manages at the end of the period, (2) properties that are consolidated in Aimco's GAAP financial statements, and (3) properties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Aimco's GAAP financial statements. Amounts do not include capital additions related to:
- consolidated properties sold during the period or classified as held for sale at the end of the period;
- consolidated properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities; or
- consolidated properties that Aimco owns but does not manage.
Aimco believes the capital addition detail provided in Supplemental Schedule 9 provides an enhanced understanding of capital additions related to our primary business of owning and operating apartment communities. A reconciliation of capital additions presented on Supplemental Schedule 9 to Aimco's consolidated GAAP information is presented below.
CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
Conventional Properties represent Aimco's portfolio of market-rate apartment communities. Aimco focuses on owning and operating apartment communities with rents that are 100% to 125% of local market average rents and concentrates its investment in the largest apartment markets in the United States, as measured by apartment value.
DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO:
The ratio of (a) Aimco's proportionate share of debt net of Aimco's proportionate share of cash and restricted cash, and Aimco's investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding only Aimco property debt to (b) EBITDA.
DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY TO EBITDA RATIO:
The ratio of (a) Aimco's proportionate share of debt net of Aimco's proportionate share of cash and restricted cash, and Aimco's investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding only Aimco property debt, plus Aimco's preferred stock and the preferred units of the Aimco Operating Partnership to (b) EBITDA.
DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO:
As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Compliance EBITDA), reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves, to (b) debt service, which represents the sum of (i) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs) and (ii) debt amortization, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
EFFECTIVE UNITS:
The number of actual property units multiplied by Aimco's ownership interest in the property as of the end of the current period. Effective Units may be used to analyze Aimco's proportionate financial measures on a per-unit basis.
EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA):
EBITDA is the numerator used in Aimco's calculation of EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio and EBITDA Coverage of Preferred Dividends and Interest Ratio. EBITDA is computed by adding to Aimco's Pro forma FFO (a) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization related to non-real estate assets, non-cash stock compensation expense and (b) Preferred Dividends.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST RATIO:
The ratio of (a) EBITDA to (b) Adjusted Interest Expense . Aimco's management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS RATIO:
The ratio of (a) EBITDA to (b) the sum of Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends. Aimco's management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO:
As defined by Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Compliance EBITDA to (b) fixed charges, which represent the sum of (i) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs), (ii) debt amortization and (iii) Preferred Dividends, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
FREE CASH FLOW INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN:
Free Cash Flow represents a property's net operating income less capital spending required to maintain the condition of the property, and a Free Cash Flow Internal Rate of Return represents the rate of return generated by discounting the expected Free Cash Flow from the property and the proceeds from its eventual sale.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO):
FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT. In October 2011, NAREIT revised its definition of FFO to exclude operating real estate impairments effective for the fourth quarter 2011. All prior period FFO results included in this Earnings Release have been restated accordingly.
In addition to FFO, Aimco uses
PRO FORMA FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Pro forma FFO)
and
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO)
to measure performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO as defined above, excluding preferred equity redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect Aimco's operating results. Aimco excludes preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of operating performance. AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements (also adjusted for noncontrolling interests).
FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO are helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because they capture features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO, Pro forma FFO or AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Net income (loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders as determined in accordance with GAAP is reconciled to FFO and Pro forma FFO as presented on Supplemental Schedule 1 and reconciled to AFFO on the following page.
NEW LEASE AND RENEWAL RATES:
Aimco measures changes in rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same apartment. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or a renewal of an existing lease.
OTHER AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
Affordable Properties that do not meet the Same Store Property definition because they are not managed by Aimco and/or Aimco's ownership interest is less than 10%.
OTHER CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
Conventional Properties that have significant rent control restrictions, university housing properties, non-multi-family such as commercial operations or fitness facilities at Aimco's multi-family properties, and properties that had not reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of January 1, 2011, often due to a casualty event.
OTHER EXPENSES, NET:
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships, certain other corporate expenses and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal).
PREFERRED DIVIDENDS:
Preferred dividends include dividends paid with respect to Aimco's Preferred Stock and the Aimco Operating Partnership Preferred Partnership Units.
PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI):
NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations and financing arrangements. NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. A reconciliation of NOI as presented in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information to Aimco's consolidated GAAP amounts is provided below and on the following page.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES:
Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or (2) occupancy was not stabilized as of January 1, 2011 due to ongoing or completed renovations, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements.
SAME STORE PROPERTIES:
Same Store properties are those properties (1) that are managed by Aimco, (2) in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10%, and (3) that have reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of January 1, 2011. Same Store properties are classified as either Conventional or Affordable and properties classified in the consolidated financial statements as held for sale are not included in Same Store.
