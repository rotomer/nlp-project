Aimco Reports
Third
Quarter 2012 Results
Denver, Colorado,
November 1, 2012
- Apartment Investment and Management Company (Aimco) (NYSE: AIV) announced today its
third
quarter 2012 results.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: We are on track for the solid execution of our 2012 plans. Conventional Same Store operating income year-to-date has increased
6.7%
over last year due to consistent renewal rent gains and good success in controlling costs. Our portfolio is much improved with average rents of
$1,332
, up
8%
year-over-year, due to investment in property upgrades, sale of lower-rated properties, and the quality of our acquisitions. We have restarted our redevelopment program with clear plans, high-quality locations and attractive expected returns. Our balance sheet is much improved with leverage reduced by approximately
$700
million.
 
Chief Financial Officer Ernie Freedman adds: Third quarter Pro forma FFO of
$0.46
per share exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.01 per share, primarily as a result of better than expected property operating results.  At the midpoint of our guidance, we are projecting full year FFO and AFFO per share growth of approximately
11%
and
31%
, respectively.
Financial Results
Third
Quarter Pro forma FFO Up
12%
, AFFO Up
38%
Year-to-date 2011 financial results include a deduction of
$0.15
per share related to debt prepayment penalties and write-off of deferred loan costs incurred in connection with a refinancing and securitization transaction during second quarter 2011. Excluding these charges, comparable year-to-date Pro forma FFO and AFFO per share were
$1.22
and
$0.82
, respectively.
Pro forma FFO
- Pro forma FFO increased
12%
when compared to
third
quarter 2011 as a result of: improved property operating results; additional income generated by investments in partnership tenders and mergers; and lower preferred stock dividends due to
$600.9 million
of redemptions during 2012. These positive results were somewhat offset by lower interest income and lower income from discontinued operations. Pro forma FFO was within Aimco
'
s guidance range of $0.43 to $0.47 per share.
Adjusted Funds from Operations
- AFFO increased
38%
when compared to
third
quarter 2011. Capital Replacements continue to decline year-over-year in line with the reduced number of apartment units as Aimco's portfolio is concentrated in fewer properties with higher margins, generating AFFO growth at a faster rate than Pro forma FFO growth.
Property Operations
Aimco's property operations consist primarily of Conventional real estate operations, which relate to Aimco's diversified portfolio of market-rate apartment communities. Aimco also operates a portfolio of Affordable Properties, which consists of properties with rents that are generally paid, in whole or in part, by a government agency. Over the next four to five years, Aimco expects to dispose of these Affordable Properties and reinvest capital in its Conventional portfolio.
Third
Quarter Total Same Store NOI Up
6.9%
, Up
6.4%
Year-to-Date
Conventional Same Store Results
Rental Rates
Affordable Same Store Results
- For
third
quarter 2012, average daily occupancy for the Affordable portfolio was
98.9
%, an increase of
1.2
% from
third
quarter 2011, while average revenue per unit increased
3.2
% from $
960
to $
991
per unit.
Portfolio Management
Aimco's portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of A, B and C-quality conventional properties, averaging B/B+ in quality, and diversified among the largest coastal and job growth markets in the U.S., as measured by total apartment value.
Aimco measures Conventional Property asset quality based on rents compared to local market average rents as reported by REIS, a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance information and analysis. Aimco defines asset quality as follows: A-quality assets are those with rents greater than 125% of local market average; B-quality assets are those with rents 90% to 125% of local market average; and C-quality assets are those with rents less than 90% of local market average. For
second
quarter 2012, the most recent period for which REIS information is available, Aimco's Conventional Property rents averaged
101
% of local market average rents, unchanged from
first
quarter 2011.
Aimco's target markets are primarily coastal markets, and also include several Sun Belt cities and Chicago, Illinois. In executing its portfolio strategy, Aimco expects to sell each year the lowest-rated 5% to 10% of its portfolio and to invest the proceeds from such sales in redevelopment and acquisition of higher-quality properties. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, from 2006 through 2011, Aimco increased its year-end conventional portfolio average revenue per unit at a compound annual growth rate of
5.5
%. Approximately one-quarter of the revenue growth is attributable to market rent growth, notwithstanding two consecutive years of market rent declines, with the balance representing the impact of portfolio improvements through dispositions, redevelopment and acquisitions. Aimco expects to sell down its Affordable portfolio over the next four-to-five years.
Conventional Property Revenue per Unit Up
8.0
% to
$1,332
Third
quarter 2012 Conventional portfolio average revenue per unit was
$1,332
, an
8.0
% increase compared to
third
quarter 2011, as a result of year-over-year revenue growth of
4.9%
and the sale of Conventional Properties during 2011 and 2012 with average revenues per unit substantially lower than those of the retained portfolio.
Dispositions
- In
third
quarter 2012, Aimco sold
eight
Conventional Properties and
14
Affordable Properties with
2,349
and
1,562
units, respectively, for
$235.4
million in gross proceeds. Average revenue per unit for the Conventional Properties sold during the quarter was
$795
, compared to the retained portfolio average of
$1,332
per unit. Aimco's share of net sales proceeds after distributions to limited partners, repayment of existing property debt and transaction costs was
$62.3
million.
Acquisitions
- During the
third
quarter, Aimco acquired for
$19.7 million
a property located in Downtown San Diego, adjacent to the Gaslamp District. The acquisition was funded in part by the assumption of
$9.7 million
of non-recourse property debt, and in part by the tax-free exchange of proceeds from the sale of lower-rated properties. The acquired property consists of 84 apartment homes and approximately 8,000 square feet of commercial space. The property's average residential revenue per unit is $1,880, and its average rents are approximately 15% greater than the local market average. Aimco intends to add value to the acquisition through property upgrades and operational improvements.
Redevelopment
During the
third
quarter, Aimco began the redevelopment of The Preserve at Marin located in Corte Madera, California. The Preserve at Marin has unobstructed views of San Francisco Bay and Mount Tamalpais, and direct access to nearby nature preserves. Aimco acquired this vacant 126-unit property in August 2011, and, including its purchase price, expects to invest a total of
$85
million in the property. First occupancy is anticipated in the second quarter 2013 and current market rents for comparable product are estimated to average
$3,880
per unit.
Also during the third quarter, Aimco continued the redevelopment of its Elm Creek property in Chicago, where 28 new townhomes are being constructed on a vacant land parcel contiguous to the property. During the
quarter, Aimco also completed construction of an exclusive roof-top patio and lounge area and amenity upgrades at its Palazzo at Park La Brea property, located in West Los Angeles. Redevelopment of the property's four penthouse model units was substantially complete at quarter-end. Also during third quarter, Aimco began a multi-phase capital project at its 2900 on First property in Seattle. The initial phase of this project consists of Capital Replacement and Capital Improvement investments, with redevelopment beginning in 2013.
As Aimco previously announced, Aimco started in the fourth quarter the redevelopment of its Lincoln Place property in Venice, California. An earlier phase began last year with the redevelopment of four buildings with 65 apartment homes. Work was completed earlier this year and 50 of the apartment homes have been re-leased to returning residents. Over the next two years, Aimco will redevelop another 41 buildings including 631 now-vacant apartment homes, together with common areas and landscaping. Aimco will also construct on now-vacant land 13 new buildings with 99 apartment homes, a 5,000 square foot leasing center and a 6,100 square foot fitness center and pool area.
The Lincoln Place redevelopment is being funded by a $190.7 million FHA-insured loan that closed in October. The loan bears interest at 2.73% and is interest-only until 2014, when it converts to a 40-year fully amortizing loan that is freely pre-payable after 10 years. At closing, Aimco prepaid a $63 million loan secured by the property that required interest at 7.5% and that was due in fourth quarter 2013. Additionally, because of its historic significance, the property has been approved for historic tax credits, which Aimco intends to sell, expecting to raise $16 million.
During fourth quarter 2012, Aimco expects to begin multi-phase capital projects at Park Towne Place and The Sterling, both located in Center-City Philadelphia. Similar to the 2900 on First project, the initial phases of the Philadelphia projects will consist of Capital Replacement and Capital Improvement investments, with redevelopment beginning in 2013.
During 2012, Aimco expects to invest $100 million in redevelopment at ten properties. At the end of the third quarter, construction was underway at nine of these properties, including the three properties undergoing multi-phase capital projects. Over the next few years, Aimco expects to invest approximately $400 million in redevelopment of these ten properties and generate on average initial cash returns before projected market rent growth greater than 7% and Free Cash Flow Internal Rates of Return in excess of 10%.
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
Components of Aimco Leverage
Leverage Ratios
Aimco's leverage targets are: Debt and Preferred Equity to EBITDA of less than 7.0x; and EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends of greater than 2.5x. Aimco also focuses on Debt to EBITDA and EBITDA Coverage of Interest ratios. See the Glossary for definitions of these metrics.
EBITDA Coverage of Interest and Preferred Dividends ratios are provided on a pro forma basis to exclude dividends on preferred stock redeemed during 2012.
Future leverage reduction is expected from earnings growth generated by the current portfolio and by regularly scheduled property debt amortization funded from retained earnings.
Liquidity
Aimco's recourse debt at
September 30, 2012
, was limited to its revolving credit facility, which Aimco uses for working capital purposes and to secure letters of credit. At the end of
third
quarter, Aimco had outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility of
$66.2
million and available capacity was
$406.8
million, net of
$27.0
million of letters of credit backed by the facility. Also at the end of the quarter, Aimco had on hand
$102.5
million of cash.
Equity Activity
Common Stock Offerings
- Pursuant to an option granted to underwriters of a $240.7 million equity offering completed in June, Aimco sold in July 1,350,000 shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of $36.1 million, or $26.74 per share.
Preferred Stock Redemption
- Also during
third
quarter, using primarily the proceeds from the June and July equity offerings, Aimco redeemed for $300.0 million all of the outstanding shares of its Class U Cumulative Preferred Stock. In connection with the redemption, Aimco recognized redemption related charges of
$12.1
million, consisting of previously deferred issuance costs and discounts.
Dividend
- As announced on October 30, 2012, Aimco's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended
September 30, 2012
. The
third
quarter 2012 dividend is payable on November 30, 2012, to stockholders of record on November 16, 2012.
2012 Outlook
Change in Guidance for Conventional Same Store NOI Growth Compared to 2011
Aimco currently expects full year 2012 Conventional Same Store revenue to increase 4.6% when compared to 2011, which is 0.4% lower than the midpoint projected by Aimco in second quarter 2012. This decrease is the result of: a decrease in previously projected tenant utility reimbursements, which are accounted for in other rental income; and a decrease in expected second half average daily occupancy. Lower projected utility reimbursements are more than offset by expected utility expense savings, generating a positive impact to NOI of 0.17% compared to Aimco's prior forecast.

GLOSSARY AND RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES
This Earnings Release and Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by Aimco management that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Aimco's definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP financial and operating measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial and operating measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance and should not be considered an alternative measure of liquidity.
ACQUISITION PROPERTIES:
Properties acquired since January 1, 2011.
ADJUSTED INTEREST EXPENSE:
Adjusted Interest Expense represents Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense less (i) prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs and (ii) the amount of interest income recognized by Aimco related to its investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding only Aimco property debt.
AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
Affordable Properties benefit from governmental programs intended to provide housing to people with low or moderate incomes. These programs, which are usually administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or state housing finance agencies, typically provide mortgage insurance, favorable financing terms, tax credit equity, or rental assistance payments to the property owners. Under these programs, rent adjustments are made in accordance with property-specific contracts between Aimco and HUD, with rent increases generally based on an adjustment factor set by HUD annually.
AIMCO OPERATING PARTNERSHIP:
AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, is the operating partnership in Aimco's UPREIT structure. Aimco owns approximately 95% of the common partnership units of the Aimco Operating Partnership.
AIMCO PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION:
Non-GAAP measures representing Aimco's share of financial information discussed in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information. Aimco's proportionate share of financial information includes Aimco's share of unconsolidated real estate partnerships and excludes noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. Proportionate reporting benefits the users of Aimco's financial information by providing the amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities attributable only to Aimco stockholders. Aimco also refers to this measure as Aimco's Share of financial information. See Supplemental Schedules 1, 3 and 4 for reconciliation of Aimco's proportionate share of financial results to Aimco's consolidated financial statements.
CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEFINITIONS AND RECONCILIATION
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS (CI):
CI includes all non-Redevelopment capital additions that are made to enhance the value, profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition.
CAPITAL REPLACEMENTS (CR):
Unlike CI, CR does not increase the useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. CR represents the portion of capital additions that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets. CR is deducted in the calculation of AFFO.
CASUALTY CAPITAL ADDITIONS:
Casualty capital additions represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an asset after a casualty event such as a hurricane, tornado or flood.
Supplemental Schedule 9 contains capital additions information related to (1) residential properties that Aimco owns and manages at the end of the period, (2) properties that are consolidated in Aimco's GAAP financial statements, and (3) properties that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Aimco's GAAP financial statements. Amounts do not include capital additions related to:
- consolidated properties sold during the period or classified as held for sale at the end of the period;
- consolidated properties that are not multi-family such as commercial properties or fitness facilities; or
- consolidated properties that Aimco owns but does not manage.
Aimco believes the capital addition detail provided in Supplemental Schedule 9 provides an enhanced understanding of capital additions related to our primary business of owning and operating apartment communities. A reconciliation of capital additions presented on Supplemental Schedule 9 to Aimco's consolidated GAAP information is presented below.
CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
Conventional Properties represent Aimco's portfolio of market-rate apartment communities. Aimco's portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of A, B and C-quality conventional properties, averaging B/B+ in quality, and diversified among the largest coastal and job growth markets in the United States, as measured by apartment value.
DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO:
The ratio of (a) Aimco's proportionate share of debt net of Aimco's proportionate share of cash and restricted cash, and Aimco's investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding only Aimco property debt to (b) EBITDA.
DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY TO EBITDA RATIO:
The ratio of (a) Aimco's proportionate share of debt net of Aimco's proportionate share of cash and restricted cash, and Aimco's investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding only Aimco property debt, plus Aimco's preferred stock and the preferred units of the Aimco Operating Partnership to (b) EBITDA.
DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO:
As defined in Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Compliance EBITDA), reduced by certain capital expenditure reserves, to (b) debt service, which represents the sum of (i) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs) and (ii) debt amortization, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
EFFECTIVE UNITS:
The number of actual property units multiplied by Aimco's ownership interest in the property as of the end of the current period. Effective Units may be used to analyze Aimco's proportionate financial measures on a per-unit basis.
EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA):
EBITDA is the numerator used in Aimco's calculation of EBITDA Coverage of Interest Ratio and EBITDA Coverage of Preferred Dividends and Interest Ratio. EBITDA is computed by adding to Aimco's Pro forma FFO (a) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization related to non-real estate assets, non-cash stock compensation expense and (b) Preferred Dividends.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST RATIO:
The ratio of (a) EBITDA to (b) Adjusted Interest Expense. Aimco's management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
EBITDA COVERAGE OF INTEREST AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS RATIO:
The ratio of (a) EBITDA to (b) the sum of Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends. Aimco's management uses this ratio as one measure of leverage.
FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO:
As defined by Aimco's credit agreement, the ratio of (a) EBITDA computed in accordance with the terms of Aimco's credit agreement, which differs from EBITDA defined above, to (b) fixed charges, which represent the sum of (i) Aimco's proportionate share of interest expense (excluding prepayment penalties and amortization of deferred financing costs), (ii) debt amortization and (iii) Preferred Dividends, for the four fiscal quarters preceding the date of calculation.
FREE CASH FLOW INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN:
Free Cash Flow represents a property's net operating income less capital spending required to maintain the condition of the property, and a Free Cash Flow Internal Rate of Return represents the rate of return generated by discounting the expected Free Cash Flow from the property and the proceeds from its eventual sale.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO):
FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Aimco computes FFO for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by NAREIT. In October 2011, NAREIT revised its definition of FFO to exclude operating real estate impairments effective for the fourth quarter 2011. All prior period FFO results included in this Earnings Release have been restated accordingly.
In addition to FFO, Aimco uses
PRO FORMA FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (Pro forma FFO)
and
ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (AFFO)
to measure performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO as defined above, excluding preferred equity redemption related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect Aimco's operating results. Aimco excludes preferred equity redemption related amounts (gains or losses) from Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of operating performance. AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements (also adjusted for noncontrolling interests).
FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO are helpful to investors in understanding Aimco's performance because they capture features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciating assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. There can be no assurance that Aimco's method for computing FFO, Pro forma FFO or AFFO is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Net income (loss) attributable to Aimco common stockholders as determined in accordance with GAAP is reconciled to FFO and Pro forma FFO as presented on Supplemental Schedule 1 and reconciled to AFFO on the following page.
NEW LEASE AND RENEWAL RATES:
Aimco measures changes in rental rates by comparing, on a lease-by-lease basis, the rate on a newly executed lease to the rate on the expiring lease for that same apartment. Newly executed leases are classified as either a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or a renewal of an existing lease.
OTHER AFFORDABLE PROPERTIES:
Affordable Properties that do not meet the Same Store Property definition because they are not managed by Aimco and/or Aimco's ownership interest is less than 10%.
OTHER CONVENTIONAL PROPERTIES:
Conventional Properties that have significant rent control restrictions, non-multi-family such as commercial operations or fitness facilities at Aimco's multi-family properties, and properties that had not reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of January 1, 2011, often due to a casualty event.
OTHER EXPENSES, NET:
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships, certain other corporate expenses and partnership expenses (partnership level expenses incurred directly or indirectly for services such as audit, tax and legal).
PREFERRED DIVIDENDS:
Preferred dividends include dividends paid with respect to Aimco's Preferred Stock and the Aimco Operating Partnership Preferred Partnership Units.
PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI):
NOI is defined by Aimco as total property rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes. NOI does not include: property management revenues, primarily from affiliates; casualties; property management expenses; depreciation; or interest expense. NOI is helpful because it helps both investors and management to understand the operating performance of real estate excluding costs associated with decisions about acquisition pricing, overhead allocations and financing arrangements. NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of real estate. A reconciliation of NOI as presented in this Earnings Release and Supplemental Information to Aimco's consolidated GAAP amounts is provided below and on the following page.
REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES:
Properties where (1) a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations or (2) occupancy was not stabilized as of January 1, 2011 due to ongoing or completed renovations, such as exteriors, common areas or unit improvements.
SAME STORE PROPERTIES:
Same Store properties are those properties (1) that are managed by Aimco, (2) in which Aimco's ownership exceeds 10%, and (3) that have reached and maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of January 1, 2011. Same Store properties are classified as either Conventional or Affordable and properties classified in the consolidated financial statements as held for sale are not included in Same Store.
