Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2004 net operating income was $38.6 million, up 13.2% from second quarter 2003 net operating income of $34.1 million. First half 2004 net operating income of $78.6 million grew 14.5% from $68.7 million in the first half of 2003. Net operating income for the second quarter and six-month period of 2004 increased due to growth in net earned premiums and improved loss experience, primarily as a result of lower catastrophe activity versus the second quarter and first six months of 2003.
 
Assurant Solutions second quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 10.5% to $610.6 million from $552.4 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 grew 9.8% to $1.2 billion from $1.1 billion in the first half of 2003. The increases in net earned premium for the second quarter and six-month period of 2004 were primarily due to growth in the creditor-placed homeowners insurance and extended service contract products.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health second quarter 2004 net operating income increased 31.3% to $39.9 million from $30.4 million in same period in 2003. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 grew 23.7% to $76.6 million from $62.0 million in the first half of 2003. The increases in net operating income for the second quarter and the six-month period of 2004 were primarily due to premium growth and further improvement in combined ratio from already favorable levels.
Assurant Health second quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 13.8% to $559.4 million from $491.7 million in the same period in 2003. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 increased 14.6% to $1.1 billion from $968.8 million in the first half of 2003. Net earned premium growth for the second quarter and six-month period of 2004 is attributable to continued sales and membership growth in the individual medical product lines. Health Savings Account (HSA) sales continued to be a strong contributor to individual medical sales. In the second quarter of 2004, Assurant Health renewed its national marketing alliance with State Farm Insurance, under which Assurant Health is the exclusive provider of individual medical insurance marketed through State Farm agents nationwide.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2004 net operating income decreased 23.8% to $14.0 million when compared to the particularly strong second quarter of 2003 net operating income of $18.4 million. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 increased 2.8% to $27.3 million from $26.5 million in the first half of 2003. The increase in net operating income for the first half of 2004 was primarily due to favorable loss experience in the Disability and Group Life businesses.
Assurant Employee Benefits second quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 2.1% to $309.2 million from $302.8 million in the same period of 2003. Net earned premiums in the first half of 2004 grew 0.7% to $627.2 million from $623.0 million in the first half of 2003. Net earned premium increases for the second quarter and the six-month period of 2004 were primarily driven by increases in Disability premiums, which were offset by lower premium growth in the Dental and Group Life product lines as a result of pricing and renewal discipline in an increasingly competitive environment.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed second quarter 2004 net operating income was $10.1 million, up 2.7%
 
from $9.9 million in the same period of 2003. First half 2004 net operating income decreased 12.7% to $16.6 million from $19.0 million in the first half of 2003. The increase in second quarter 2004 net operating income was attributable to actions taken to reduce crediting rates where we have the ability to do so and reduced expenses. Net operating income for the first half of 2004 decreased primarily due to lower new money yields.
Assurant Preneed second quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 0.6% to $136.3 million from $137.2 million in the same period of 2003. Assurant Preneed first half 2004 net earned premiums decreased 0.6% to $269.5 million from $271.2 million in the first half of 2003. The segment's sales activity has begun to stabilize compared to a year ago and net earned premiums increased for the second consecutive quarter.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the run-off of these businesses. Interest expense in the second quarter of 2004 declined by $8.5 million after-tax compared to the second quarter of 2003 as a result of a lower level of debt at lower interest rates. Corporate and other net operating loss for the second quarter of 2004 was $3.8 million, primarily due to public company expenses, including expenses related to Sarbanes Oxley compliance, and lower investment income. Additionally, each Assurant business incurred Sarbanes-Oxley related expenses.
Financial Position
At June 30, 2004 total assets were $23.3 billion and total invested assets, cash and cash equivalents were $11.6 billion. In the second quarter of 2004, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $3.7 million compared to net realized after-tax gains of $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2003. In the second quarter of 2004, Assurant recorded no other than temporary impairments compared to $3.2 million after-tax in the second quarter of 2003.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating
 
income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.
