Reconciliation of Net operating income to Net income
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2004 net operating income was $3.0 million, down 90.5% from third quarter 2003 net operating income of $31.4 million. Net operating income for the first nine months in 2004 was $81.6 million down 18.5% from $100.1 million in the first nine months of 2003. Net operating income for the third quarter and nine-month period of 2004 decreased due to claims from four hurricanes during the quarter. After tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, in the quarter were $49.1 million, compared to $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding these losses, net operating income increased primarily due to good loss experience and general business growth.
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2004 net earned premiums decreased 1.7% to $602.7 million from $612.9 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 grew 5.7% to $1.8 billion from $1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2003. The changes in net earned premium were primarily due to growth in our specialty property products and international businesses offset by declines in domestic credit insurance.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2004 net operating income increased 56.4% to $47.9 million from $30.6 million in same period in 2003. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2004 grew 34.5% to $124.5 million from $92.6 million in the first nine months of 2003. The increases in net operating income for the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2004 were primarily due to individual medical premium growth and continued improvement in combined ratio from already favorable levels.
Assurant Health third quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 11.1% to $563.2 million from $506.7 million in the same period in 2003. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 increased 13.4% to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2003. Net earned premium growth for the third quarter and nine-month period of 2004 is attributable to the individual medical product lines. For the third consecutive quarter, Health Savings Account (HSA) sales continued to be a strong contributor to individual medical sales.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2004 net operating income decreased 32.2% to $15.0 million from net operating income of $22.1 million in the same period of 2003. Net operating income for the nine months of 2004 decreased 13.1% to $42.2 million from $48.6 million in the first nine months of 2003. Third quarter 2003 results benefited from a change in reserves of $11.5 million after tax. Excluding this reserve change, net operating income for the third quarter and nine months of 2004 increased due to continued improvements in loss experience in the disability and group life businesses and increased investment income.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2004 net earned premiums grew 2.9% to $305.8 million from $297.3 million in the same period of 2003. Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2004 grew 1.4% to $933.0 million from $920.3 million in the first nine months of 2003. Net earned premium increases for the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2004 were primarily driven by increases in disability premiums. Modest premium growth was a result of pricing and renewal discipline in a competitive market, however voluntary sales continue to show strong growth.
Assurant Preneed
Assurant Preneed third quarter 2004 net operating income was $8.9 million, essentially unchanged from the same period of 2003. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2004 decreased 8.3% to $25.5 million from $27.9 million in the first nine months of 2003. The decrease in net operating income was attributable to a reduction in investment yields resulting from continued low new money rates.
Assurant Preneed third quarter 2004 net earned premiums increased 1.7% to $131.8 million from $129.6 million in the same period of 2003. Assurant Preneed first nine months 2004 net earned premiums of $401.3 million were comparable to $400.9 million in the first nine months of 2003.
Corporate
Amortization of deferred gains from businesses sold through reinsurance declined consistent with the run-off of these businesses. Interest expense in the third quarter of 2004 declined by $9.2 million after tax compared to the third quarter of 2003 due to lower levels of debt at lower interest rates. Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2004 was $1.2 million, compared to income of $9.9 million in 2003. The decrease is primarily due to public company expenses, including expenses related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance, and lower investment income.
Financial Position
At September 30, 2004 total assets were $23.6 billion and total invested assets, cash and cash equivalents were $12.1 billion. In the third quarter of 2004, Assurant had after-tax net capital gains of approximately $1.6 million compared to net realized after-tax gains of $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2003. In the third quarter of 2004, Assurant recorded no other than temporary impairments.
As part of its approved share repurchase program of up to 10% of its outstanding common stock, Assurant repurchased 1.36 million shares in the open market during the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, for an average price of $26.00 per share, including commissions. As a result, on September 30, 2004, the Company had 140.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. The stock buyback program may utilize open market and/or private transactions.

Safe Harbor Statement
Some of the statements included in this press release, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, including, but not limited to, our 10-K, as filed with the SEC.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in this press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
 
(1) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(2) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and other unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
(2) Pro forma earnings per share has been included as a measure of operating performance. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. Pro forma earnings per share reflects earnings per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that this adjusted measure provides a better indication of operating performance than the corresponding GAAP measure, earnings per share.
(3) Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) has been included as a measure of stockholder value. The company believes book value per share excluding AOCI provides investors a better measure of stockholder value than book value per share because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments and foreign currency translation, which tend to be highly variable from period to period.
(4) Pro forma book value per share and Pro forma book value per share excluding AOCI have been included as measures of stockholder value. In February 2004, Assurant completed a significant capital restructuring in conjunction with its initial public offering of common stock. These Pro forma book value per share measures reflect book value per share adjusted as if this capital restructuring had occurred on January 1, 2003. This restructuring included: a stock split and conversion of Class B and C shares resulting in total outstanding shares of 109,222,276; the issuance of 32,976,854 shares of Assurant common stock to Fortis Insurance N.V. in exchange for a capital contribution of $725.5 million, and the issuance of 68,976 restricted shares of Assurant common stock to certain officers and directors of the company pursuant to specific restricted stock grants (9,546 vested shares and 59,430 unvested shares). These transactions occurred subsequent to the December 31, 2003 balance sheet, but management believes that these adjusted measures provide a better indication of stockholder value than the corresponding GAAP measures, book value per share and book value per share excluding AOCI.
