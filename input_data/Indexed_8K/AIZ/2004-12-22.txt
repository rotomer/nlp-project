Section 8 - Other Events Item 8.01 Other Events. Our third quarter results included losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, of approximately $49 million after-tax related to the four hurricanes that impacted the Southeast United States during the quarter. This amount included loss estimates for claims reported but not yet paid and for claims incurred but not reported. At this time, a majority of the claims have been reported and settled and we are in a better position to understand how our total loss exposure will develop. We now believe that our total losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, will be approximately $59 million after-tax for the four hurricanes. Losses have been higher than originally estimated primarily due to the escalating costs of materials and labor as each storm reduced supplies of materials and available skilled workers. We believe that final loss development, net of reinsurance recoveries, will be very close to our revised estimate of approximately $59 million after-tax. 2
