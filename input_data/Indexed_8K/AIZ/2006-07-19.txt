Safe Harbor Statement:
Some of the statements included in this statistical supplement, particularly those anticipating future financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters, are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of the factors that could affect our actual results please refer to the risk factors identified from time to time in our SEC reports, posted on the Assurant website at www.assurant.com.
Regulation G  Non GAAP Measure
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measure to analyze the company's operating performance for the periods presented in the press release. Because Assurant's calculation of this measure may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measure to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please see Page 3 for reconciliation.
