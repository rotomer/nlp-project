FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  November 1, 2007  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the third quarter of 2007 and the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
Third Quarter Results
Net income in the third quarter of 2007 increased 24% to $187.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2006 net income of $151.3 million, or $1.18 per diluted share.
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the third quarter of 2007 increased 28% to $195.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2006 net operating income of $153.0 million, or $1.20 per diluted share.
J. Kerry Clayton, interim president and chief executive officer, said: "Assurant's performance so far this year and during the quarter illustrates the strength of our diversified specialty insurance strategy, and our prudent, focused approach to long-term profitable growth in targeted areas. Our strategy is fortified by our solid financial foundation and is reinforced by our strong leadership team which continues a disciplined approach."
Net earned premiums of $1.89 billion in the third quarter of 2007 increased 10% from $1.72 billion in the third quarter of 2006, driven primarily by growth in Assurant Specialty Property.
Net investment income in the third quarter of 2007 increased 7% to $194.0 million from $180.7 million in the third quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets and higher investment yield.
Nine-Month Results
Net income in the first nine months of 2007 was $532.9 million, or $4.37 per diluted share, an increase of 15%, compared to net income of $464.9 million, or $3.58 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006.
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2007 was $539.8 million, or $4.42 per diluted share, an increase of 16% compared to net operating income of $466.5 million, or $3.59 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2006. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual, or non-recurring items.
Net earned premiums of $5.45 billion in the first nine months of 2007 increased 7% from $5.08 billion in the first nine months of 2006.
Net investment income in the first nine months of 2007 increased 9% to $601.2 million from $553.7 million in the first nine months of 2006 primarily resulting from an increase in average invested assets and $37.0 million of real estate investment income compared with $18.0 million in the first nine months of 2006.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2007 net operating income was $37.4 million, a 10% decrease from the third quarter 2006 net operating income of $41.7 million. The third quarter of 2006 benefited from $5.4 million after-tax of fee income from a closed block of extended service contract business. In the third quarter of 2007, the preneed insurance product benefited from the July 2007 acquisition of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company ("Mayflower"). Net operating income for the first nine months of 2007 was $111.7 million, a 6% decrease from $118.6 million during the first nine months of 2006. Results for the first nine months of 2007 were positively impacted by increased investment income including an additional $7.6 million of after tax real estate investment income compared to the first nine months of 2006. The quarter and first nine months of 2007 declined primarily as a result of higher domestic and international combined ratios due to less favorable domestic service contract loss experience, the previously disclosed loss of a debt deferment client in late 2006 and continued investments made to support the business' international strategic expansion.
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 10% to $649.9 million from $591.2 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 increased 6% to $1.85 billion from $1.75 billion during the first nine months of 2006. The increases for the quarter and nine months were primarily due to continued strong growth in domestic and international service contracts and $9.9 million of preneed premiums from the Mayflower acquisition. The increases were partially offset by declines in preneed premiums due to the 2005 sale of the U.S. independent franchise and in domestic credit insurance which continues to diminish consistent with long-term expectations.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2007 net operating income was $114.7 million, up significantly from $53.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net operating income in the first nine months of 2007 increased 58% to $279.3 million compared to $177.2 million in the first nine months of 2006. Net operating income increases for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2007 were primarily driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance both organically and through acquisition, continued exceptional combined ratios, including no catastrophic experience during the quarter or year-to-date, and increased investment income.
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 42% to $445.2 million compared to $313.6 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 increased 41% to $1.21 billion compared to $857.4 million in the first nine months of 2006. These increases are primarily due to the continued organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance. The nine month results benefited from the creditor-placed business acquired from Safeco in May of 2006.
 
Assurant Health
Assurant Health third quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 12% to $39.4 million from $44.8 million in the third quarter of 2006. The third quarter of 2006 benefited from $2.6 million after-tax in favorable legal settlements. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2007 decreased 13% to $113.7 million from $131.0 million in the first nine months of 2006. The decreases for the quarter and first nine months of 2007 are primarily due to the decline in small group net earned premiums and an increase in the combined ratio due to higher small group loss experience. This was partially offset by continued individual medical net earned premium growth. After-tax real estate investment income was $2.5 million less in the first nine months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006.
Assurant Health third quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 1% to $514.2 million from $521.5 million in the third quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 decreased 2% to $1.54 billion from $1.56 billion in the first nine months of 2006. Although individual medical premiums for the quarter and first nine months grew, individual medical sales for the quarter declined due to increased competitive pressures. Small group premiums continued to decline as expected.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 16% to $20.4 million from net operating income of $24.4 million in the third quarter of 2006. Although group life loss experience was good for the quarter, it was not as good as the excellent group life loss experience in the same period last year. Group disability and group dental loss experience continued to be favorable. Net operating income during the first nine months of 2007 increased 10% to $70.8 million from $64.2 million during the first nine months of 2006. Results for the first nine months of 2007 benefited from continued favorable overall loss experience, particularly in group disability, and were positively impacted by an additional $9.3 million of after-tax real estate investment income compared to the first nine months of 2006.
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $284.0 million from $291.2 million in the same year-ago period. Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2007 decreased 5% to $853.2 million from $899.9 million in the first nine months of 2006. These decreases are due to lower persistency as the company continues to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate
Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2007 was $11.7 million, compared to a loss of $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2006. The decrease is mainly due to $3.2 million after-tax of expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss
 
mitigation products. Corporate and other net operating loss for the first nine months of 2007 was $22.1 million compared to a loss of $13.0 million during the first nine months of 2006. This decline was primarily due to $3.2 million after tax of expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products and $3.5 million of expenses due to the change in certain tax liabilities.
Financial Position
At September 30, 2007 total assets were $26.6 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $3.9 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 10% to $32.99 from $29.97 at December 31, 2006. Nine month annualized operating return on equity (ROE), excluding AOCI, (see footnote 2), was 18.8%, and rolling four quarter operating ROE, excluding AOCI, (see footnote 2), was 18.0%. The debt to total capital ratio, excluding AOCI, was 20.2%.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
