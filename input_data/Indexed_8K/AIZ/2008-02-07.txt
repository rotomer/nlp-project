FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York  February 7, 2008  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2007 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2007.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "Assurant's performance for the quarter and year illustrates our steady execution of our diversified specialty insurance strategy despite the beginning of a slowdown in the economy. We continue to deliver growth in both net operating income and book value per share while producing top quartile return on equity. We believe this strategy has us well positioned for 2008 despite uncertainties in the economy."
Fourth Quarter Results
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 13% to $154.4 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2006 net operating income of $136.2 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased 52% to $120.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2006 net income of $252.5 million, or $2.01 per diluted share. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 includes $27.0 million of after-tax realized losses from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2006 includes a $63.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of Assurant's interest in a PPO network, Private Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) and $40.5 million of after-tax income from a favorable Assurant Solutions legal settlement.
Net earned premiums of $1.96 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 11% from $1.77 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, driven mostly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 8% to $197.8 million from $183.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets.
Twelve-Month Results
Net operating income in 2007 was $694.2 million, or $5.72 per diluted share, an increase of 15% compared to net operating income of $602.7 million, or $4.68 per diluted share, in 2006. Net operating income excludes capital gains and losses and other unusual or non-recurring items.
Net income in 2007 was $653.7 million, or $5.38 per diluted share, a decrease of 9%, compared to net income of $717.4 million, or $5.57 per diluted share, in 2006. Net income in 2007 includes $31.3 million of after-tax realized losses from other than temporary impairments in the investment portfolio. Net income in 2006 includes a $63.9 million after-tax gain from the sale of PHCS as well as $40.5 million of after-tax income from a favorable Assurant Solutions legal settlement.
Net earned premiums in 2007 were $7.41 billion, an increase of 8% from $6.84 billion in 2006. Growth in net earned premiums was driven mainly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property.
Net investment income in 2007 increased 8% to $799.1 million from $736.7 million in 2006 primarily resulting from an increase in average invested assets and $37.2 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared with $18.6 million in 2006.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2007 net operating income was $32.3 million, a 19% decrease from fourth quarter 2006 net operating income of $39.8 million. Results for the quarter were negatively impacted by $3.4 million after-tax from a client-related settlement and benefited by $3.8 million after-tax from a client commission reconciliation project, which has been completed. Net operating income for the full year was $143.9 million, a 9% decrease from 2006 net operating income of $158.4 million. Results for the quarter and year declined primarily due to higher domestic and international combined ratios. Domestic results were impacted by less favorable service contract loss experience and the previously disclosed loss of a debt deferment client in late 2006. The international business was impacted by its continued investment made to support its strategic expansion and modest increases in overall expenses.
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 10% to $678.8 million from $617.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums in 2007 increased 7% to $2.53 billion from $2.37 billion in 2006. Increases for the quarter and year were primarily driven by continued growth in domestic and international service
 
contracts as well as growth in preneed premiums from the acquisition of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company during the third quarter of 2007. The increases were partially offset by declines in domestic credit insurance for the fourth quarter and full year 2007, which continues to diminish consistent with our long term expectations.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2007 net operating income was $99.9 million, up 56% from $64.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and tax, during the quarter were $22.2 million compared with no catastrophes losses in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results for the quarter benefited by $5.9 million after-tax from a client commission reconciliation project, which has been completed. Net operating income in 2007 increased 57% to $379.2 million compared to $241.1 million in 2006. Net operating income increases were largely driven by the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance, continued favorable combined ratios and an increase in investment income. For the year, catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and tax, were $22.2 million, compared with $4.5 million in 2006.
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 36% to $476.4 million compared to $350.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums in 2007 increased 39% to $1.68 billion compared to $1.21 billion in 2006. These increases are primarily due to the continued growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance. The results for the year also benefited from the creditor-placed business acquired from Safeco in May of 2006.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2007 net operating income increased 3% to $38.0 million from $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase is primarily due to a favorable combined ratio and $2.5 million after-tax from a favorable legal settlement. Net operating income for 2007 decreased 10% to $151.7 million from $167.9 million in 2006. The decrease for the year is primarily due to the decline in small group net earned premiums, a slight increase in the combined ratio due to higher small group loss experience and a decrease in investment income. This was partially offset by continued favorable individual medical loss experience and individual medical net earned premium growth. After-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships was $2.5 million lower in 2007 compared to 2006.
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums decreased 2% to $509.3 million from $519.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net earned premiums for the year decreased 2% to $2.05 billion from $2.08 billion in 2006. Although individual medical premiums increased for the quarter and the full year of 2007, small group premiums continued to decline consistent with expectations.
 
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2007 net operating income decreased 17% to $16.2 million from net operating income of $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Results declined primarily due to a slight increase in loss experience due to a $2.1 million after-tax adjustment to reflect New York State's clarification of certain disability contract provisions and a decline in investment income. Net operating income in 2007 increased 4% to $87.0 million from $83.6 million during 2007. Full year results benefited from continued favorable overall loss experience, particularly in group disability, and were positively impacted by an additional $9.2 million of after-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared to 2006.
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2007 net earned premiums increased 4% to $291.6 million from $280.0 million in the same year-ago period. The increase is mainly the result of $14.3 million of single premium from a closed block of business. Net earned premiums for 2007 decreased 3% to $1.14 billion from $1.18 billion in 2006 as the company continued to implement its small case strategy.
Corporate & Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $27.4 million, compared to a loss of $19.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Higher losses are mainly due to $4.3 million of after-tax expense during the quarter related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. The fourth quarter 2007 results include $6.4 million of net tax expense associated with changes in certain tax liabilities compared with $6.2 million of similar net tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2006. Corporate and other net operating loss for 2007 was $49.4 million compared to a loss of $32.8 million during 2006. The higher loss for the year was primarily due to $7.5 million of after-tax expense related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products and $9.9 million of net tax expense associated with changes in certain tax liabilities compared with $6.2 million of similar net tax expense in 2006.
Financial Position
At December 31, 2007 total assets were $26.8 billion. Stockholders' equity, excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), was $4.0 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 13% to $33.73 from $29.97 at December 31, 2006. 2007 operating return on equity (ROE), excluding AOCI, (see footnote 2), was 17.8%. The debt to total capital ratio, excluding AOCI, was 19.7%.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur.
