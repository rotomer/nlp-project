Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") estimates total claims resulting from recent California wildfires to be in the range of $10 to 12 million pre-tax, which the Company does not consider to be material to its operations. Base pre-tax 2008 reinsurance premiums, which are a reduction to net earned premiums, were estimated to be $129 million in 2008 when the property catastrophe reinsurance program was announced. Given the growth of the business, base premiums in 2008 are now estimated to be $147 million. The Company expects base reinsurance costs in the fourth quarter to be relatively consistent with third quarter amounts of approximately $40 million.
In 2008, the Company secured its property catastrophe reinsurance program by purchasing a portion of the coverage in both January and June. The June reinsurance purchase included a small portion of coverage for a two year term. The Company is in the process of securing coverage for the 2009 reinsurance program. In structuring the program, the Company applies a disc iplined risk management process which includes utilizing multiple catastrophe models to evaluate the estimated loss potential from various perils, analyzing the geographic spread of risk and evaluating the reinsurance cost relative to the coverage provided. The Company also evaluates the credit quality, financial strength and claims-paying ability of the reinsurers. Given the growth of the Company's property businesses, the Company anticipates buying more coverage and adjusting the retention for the growth of the business.
The Company utilizes catastrophe reinsurance primarily for its Assurant Specialty Property business to protect the Company's capital base from catastrophe risk for its customers and to lessen the variable effect of catastrophes on earnings for shareholders.
