FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
New York- February 4, 2009 - Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the fourth quarter and the twelve months ended December 31, 2008.
Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer, said: "Although we can't avoid the chill of the economic global cooling,' Assurant's capital position remains stable and our balance sheet remains solid, setting us apart, despite the unprecedented challenges in the economy. In 2008, despite an active storm season, we were able to grow revenues and expand through strategic acquisitions. We continue to believe our diverse specialty business model serves us well, and enables us to be nimble and flexible as we adapt."
"We are maintaining a prudent, defensive approach to our investment portfolio and capital planning. Although we are not immune to the impact of the economic environment, we are effectively mixing offense and defense to strengthen the company and better position Assurant for both the near and long term," Mr. Pollock concluded.
 
Fourth Quarter Results
Net operating income (see footnote 1 at the end of this release) for the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased less than 1% to $153.7 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $154.4 million, or $1.29 per diluted share.
Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 51% to $182.4 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 net income of $120.8 million, or $1.01 per diluted share. The Company incurred $33.7 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments, which included $26.0 million after-tax of other than temporary impairments in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $33.6 million of after-tax net realized losses in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 benefited by $62.4 million from the realization of a tax asset related to the second quarter 2008 sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net earned premiums of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 2% from the fourth quarter of 2007, driven mostly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2008 decreased 7% to $183.0 million from $197.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 primarily as a result of a decrease in average invested assets and lower yields.
Twelve-Month Results
Net operating income in 2008 was $637.4 million, or $5.36 per diluted share, a decrease of 8% compared to net operating income of $694.2 million, or $5.72 per diluted share, in 2007. Results in 2008 included $102.8 million after-tax of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance compared to $22.2 million after-tax in 2007.
Net income in 2008 was $447.8 million, or $3.77 per diluted share, a decrease of 32% compared to net income of $653.7 million, or $5.38 per diluted share in 2007. Net income in 2008 includes $278.6 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments, including $221.1 million from
 
other than temporary impairments, compared to $40.5 million after-tax of net realized losses on investments in 2007. Net income in 2008 was favorably impacted by $89.0 million of a tax benefit and gain related to the second quarter 2008 sale of an inactive life insurance subsidiary.
Net earned premiums in 2008 were $7.93 billion, an increase of 7% from $7.41 billion in 2007. Growth in net earned premiums was driven mainly by growth in Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in 2008 decreased 3% to $774.3 million from $799.1 million in 2007 primarily resulting from a decrease in average invested assets and $3.9 million of investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships compared with $37.2 million in 2007.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
 
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $11.9 million, a 63% decrease from fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $32.3 million. Results for the fourth quarter 2008 decreased due to the following factors: 1) the Company's decision to exit business operations in Denmark, which resulted in a $9.7 million after-tax closing charge;
 
2) charges of $8.1 million after-tax as a result of client bankruptcies; 3) continued unfavorable United Kingdom loss experience; and 4) a decline in investment income of $5.8 million after-tax. The fourth quarter also includes a $5.9 million after-tax benefit from the final accounting of the third quarter acquisition of GE's Warranty Management Group. Net operating income for the full year 2008 was $112.2 million, a decrease of 22% from 2007. In addition to the items which impacted the fourth quarter, 2008 results were less than 2007 due to a $9.3 million after-tax decrease in investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships.
A schedule of disclosed items that affected our quarterly results by segment for the last eight quarters can be found in the financial supplement on page 19.
Assurant Solutions fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 6% to $722.2 million from $678.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by continued growth in domestic and international service contracts. Net earned premiums for 2008 were $2.81 billion, up 11% from $2.53 billion for 2007. The increase for 2008 was primarily driven by continued growth in service contracts and preneed. Results were partially offset by a continued decline in premiums related to the domestic independent runoff in preneed and domestic credit insurance as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange as the U.S. dollar strengthened against international currencies.
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $118.5 million, up 19% from $99.9 million in the fourth quarter 2007. The quarterly increase was primarily the result of growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance and continued favorable combined ratios. The fourth quarter 2008 results were impacted by $5.1 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, from the California wildfires compared to $22.2 million after-tax for the same period in 2007. Results for the fourth quarter 2007 were favorably impacted by $5.9 million after-tax from a client commission reconciliation project. Net operating income in 2008 increased 7% to $405.2 million compared to $379.2 million in 2007 driven primarily by growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance. Results in 2008 increased despite $102.8 million of after-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance. Results in 2007 included $22.2 million after-tax of catastrophe losses and benefited by $13.7 million of after-tax income from a client commission reconciliation project.
Assurant Specialty Property fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums increased 9% to $519.7 million compared to $476.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for the full year 2008 increased 22% to $2.05 billion compared to $1.68 billion in 2007. These increases were primarily the result of continued organic growth in creditor-placed homeowners insurance as average insured values and policy placement rates continue to increase. Partially
 
offsetting these factors was a net decrease in tracked loans due to continued market consolidation, and an overall decline in subprime loans.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $25.1 million, a decrease of 34% compared to fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $38.0 million. Results in the fourth quarter of 2007 were favorably impacted by $2.5 million after-tax from a favorable legal settlement. Net operating income for 2008 was $120.3 million, a decrease of 21% compared to $151.7 million for 2007. The decreases for the quarter and year were driven primarily by the continued decline in small group medical premiums and an increase in the combined ratio due to less favorable individual medical loss experience.
Assurant Health fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 5% to $481.5 million from $509.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for 2008 decreased 5% to $1.95 billion compared to $2.05 billion for 2007. The decreases for the quarter and year were due to declines in small group medical premiums of 15% and 14%, respectively, and declines in individual medical premiums of 2% and 1%, respectively.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2008 net operating income was $14.1 million, down 13% from fourth quarter 2007 net operating income of $16.2 million. Results for the fourth quarter 2008 were impacted by $2.1 million after-tax of lower investment income and a slightly higher loss ratio, partially offset by a reserve release of $3.5 million after-tax resulting from an annual reserve study and lower operating expenses. Net operating income for 2008 was $70.6 million, down 19% from 2007 net operating income of $87.0 million. Results for the year are lower as a result of $9.2 million less after-tax investment income from real estate joint venture partnerships and slightly higher loss experience compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter 2007 also included a $2.1 million charge to reflect New York State's clarification of certain disability contract provisions.
Assurant Employee Benefits fourth quarter 2008 net earned premiums decreased 4% to $281.0 million from $291.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earned premiums for 2008 decreased 3% to $1.11 billion from $1.14 billion in 2007. Results for the fourth quarter of 2008 include $5.9 million in single premium from closed blocks of business compared to $14.3 million in fourth quarter 2007. Results for 2008 include $11.4 million in single premiums from closed blocks of business compared to $49.5 million in 2007.
 
Corporate & other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $10.8 million, compared to a net operating loss of $27.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The difference includes a net decrease of $6.0 million in after-tax expenses related to the ongoing SEC investigation regarding certain loss mitigation products. Fourth quarter 2007 results also included $6.4 million of net tax expense associated with changes in tax liabilities.
Net operating loss for 2008 was $50.4 million compared to a loss of $49.4 million for 2007. The slight increase in net operating loss was primarily due to a decline of $7.6 million after-tax of investment income, partially offset by $3.9 million after-tax of income from the reimbursement of certain SEC investigation-related expenses through director and executive officer insurance coverage.
Financial Position
At December 31, 2008 total assets were $24.5 billion. Total stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), was $4.4 billion and book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, was up 10% to $37.21 from $33.73 at December 31, 2007. Debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 18.3% compared to 19.7% at December 31, 2007.
AOCI consists of foreign currency conversion translation adjustments, net unrealized gains/losses on securities, and benefit plan obligations. Net unrealized gains and losses represent the after-tax difference between the book value and market value of invested assets. At December 31, 2008, AOCI was ($670.9) million or ($5.70) per diluted share compared to $53.9 million, or $.45 per diluted share, at December 31, 2007. Invested assets at market value, excluding cash and equivalents, as a ratio of stockholders' equity, including AOCI was 3.3 to 1 at December 31, 2008.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months and year ended December, 2008 was 19.6% and 11.5%, respectively. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
