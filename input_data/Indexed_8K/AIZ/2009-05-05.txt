On May 5, 2009, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the entry by certain of its subsidiaries (the "Subsidiaries") into two reinsurance agreements (the "Reinsurance Agreements") with Ibis Re Ltd., a reinsurance company domiciled in the Cayman Islands ("Ibis Re"), in connection with a fully collateralized catastrophe reinsurance bond program. A copy of the press release describing the transaction is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Ibis Re funded the catastrophe reinsurance coverage through the issuance of two classes of catastrophe bonds in an aggregate amount of $150 million (the "CAT Bonds") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the issuance of the CAT Bonds, Ibis Re set up two insurance trusts to hold certain investments to secure payments to the Subsidiaries under the Reinsurance Agreements and the repayment of principal to the bondholders, as applicable, and entered into two related swap agreements (each a "Swap") with Goldman Sachs International (the "Swap Counterparty").
A Swap may be terminated as a result of certain events, including but not limited to a payment default by the Swap Counterparty, the insolvency of the Swap Counterparty, certain changes in law with regard to the Swap Counterparty, or certain merger transactions involving the Swap Counterparty (each a "Swap Counterparty Event"). In the event of such termination, the Company may elect either to replace the Swap Counterparty and enter into an interim swap agreement (the "Interim Swap Agreement"), acting as an interim swap counterparty opposite Ibis Re, or to appoint another swap counterparty to replace the Swap Counterparty. Following a termination of a Swap as the result of a Swap Counterparty Event, if either the Company or a designated affiliate does not upon two (2) business days notice indicate its intention to enter into the Interim Swap Agreement with Ibis Re or appoint another swap counterparty to replace the Swap Counterparty, then the related class of CAT Bond will be subject to early redemption on the next following quarterly payment date for such CAT Bond.
Copies of the Reinsurance Agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

It is agreed that this mutual intention does not apply to Contingent Business Interruption or to interests traditionally underwritten as Inland Marine or to Stock and/or Contents written on a blanket basis except where the Ceding Insurer is aware that the Total Insured Value of $250,000,000 is already exceeded for buildings, machinery, equipment and direct use and occupancy at the key location.

Section D:
Notwithstanding Section C above, in respect of the CEA, where an assessment is made against the Ceding Insurer by the CEA, the Ceding Insurer may include in its Ultimate
Net Loss only that assessment directly attributable to each separate Loss Occurrence covered hereunder. The Ceding Insurer's initial capital contribution to the CEA shall not be included in the Ultimate Net Loss.
Any assessments for accounting years subsequent to that in which the Loss Event commenced may not be included in the Ultimate Net Loss hereunder.
Notwithstanding Section C above, where an assessment is made against the Ceding Insurer by any such "Coastal Pool" and/or "Fair Plan" and/or "Rural Risk Plan" and/or "Residual Marker Mechanism," the Ceding Insurer may include in its Ultimate Net Loss only that assessment directly attributable to each separate loss occurrence covered hereunder which is not otherwise recoverable or recoupable through a premium tax credit by the Ceding Insurer.

Note
 
 
Annex II
It is the mutual intention of the parties to exclude risks, other than Offices, Hotels, Apartments, Hospitals, Educational Establishments and Public Utilities (except Railroad Schedules), and Builders Risks on the above classes, where at the time of cession, the Total Insured Value over all interests exceeds $250,000,000. However, the Ceding Insurer shall be protected hereunder, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Reinsurance Agreement, if subsequent to cession being made, the Ceding Insurer becomes acquainted with the true facts of the case and discovers that the mutual intention has been inadvertently breached; on condition that the Ceding Insurer shall at the first opportunity, and certainly by next anniversary of the original policy, exclude the risk in question.
It is agreed that this mutual intention does not apply to Contingent Business Interruption or to interests traditionally underwritten as Inland Marine or to Stock and/or Contents written on a blanket basis except where the Ceding Insurer is aware that the Total Insured Value of $250,000,000 is already exceeded for buildings, machinery, equipment and direct use and occupancy at the key location.
It is understood and agreed that this Clause shall not apply hereunder where the Ceding Insurer writes 100% of the risk.

Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association
North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association
South Carolina Windstorm and Hail Underwriting Association

AND
 
AND
 
for all perils otherwise protected hereunder shall not be excluded, except, however, that this reinsurance does not include any increase in such liability resulting from:
 
 
Section D:
Notwithstanding Section C above, in respect of the CEA, where an assessment is made against the Ceding Insurer by the CEA, the Ceding Insurer may include in its Ultimate
Net Loss only that assessment directly attributable to each separate Loss Occurrence covered hereunder. The Ceding Insurer's initial capital contribution to the CEA shall not be included in the Ultimate Net Loss.
Any assessments for accounting years subsequent to that in which the Loss Event commenced may not be included in the Ultimate Net Loss hereunder.
Notwithstanding Section C above, where an assessment is made against the Ceding Insurer by any such "Coastal Pool" and/or "Fair Plan" and/or "Rural Risk Plan" and/or "Residual Marker Mechanism," the Ceding Insurer may include in its Ultimate Net Loss only that assessment directly attributable to each separate loss occurrence covered hereunder which is not otherwise recoverable or recoupable through a premium tax credit by the Ceding Insurer.
