Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
NEW YORK, Oct. 28, 2009  Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialized insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009.
Third Quarter Results
Net income in the third quarter 2009 was $144.7 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $111.4 million, or ($0.94) per diluted share, in the third quarter 2008. Quarterly results benefited from a $12.9 million after-tax realized gain in the investment portfolio versus a $194.5 million after-tax realized loss in the third quarter 2008. In addition, there were no reportable catastrophe losses compared to $94.8 million after-tax of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums in the third quarter 2008.
Net operating income
1
for the third quarter 2009 was $126.2 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2008 net operating income of $83.1 million, or $0.70 per diluted share. The improvement reflects the absence of reportable catastrophe losses at Assurant Specialty Property and increased profitability at Assurant Solutions. Less favorable results at Assurant Employee Benefits and a loss at Assurant Health partially offset the increase.
"The third quarter 2009 was good on several fronts as we grew our capital position, increased book value per share and generated a consolidated annualized operating ROE
2
of 10.7 percent," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer.
"Assurant Specialty Property delivered excellent results while Assurant Solutions continued to show improved performance. Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits are managing through an especially challenging landscape. Both were affected by economic pressures on consumers and small businesses."
Net earned premiums in the third quarter 2009 were $1.9 billion, a 6 percent decrease from $2.0 billion in the same 2008 period, declining across all Assurant businesses driven primarily by the difficult economic environment.
Net investment income in the third quarter 2009 decreased 10 percent to $172.9 million compared to $192.3 million in the third quarter 2008 due to lower average invested assets and lower yields.
Nine-Month Results
Net income in the first nine months of 2009 was $418.6 million, or $3.54 per diluted share, an increase of 58 percent compared to $265.4 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2008. The increase reflects $217.6 million of fewer after-tax realized losses in the investment portfolio, $83.5 million of after-tax income from a legal settlement, and no reportable catastrophe losses in 2009. Nine-month results in 2008 included $94.8 million of net after-tax reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums.
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2009 decreased 25 percent to $363.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, from $483.7 million, or $4.06 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2008. The decrease was driven primarily by net operating losses at Assurant Health and lower operating earnings at Assurant Employee Benefits.
Net earned premiums for the first nine months of 2009 were $5.6 billion, a 5 percent decrease from $5.9 billion in the first nine months of 2008, declining across all Assurant businesses due primarily to the difficult economic conditions.
Net investment income for the first nine months of 2009 decreased 11 percent to $526.3 million, from $591.3 million in the first nine months of 2008, primarily due to decreases in average invested assets and investment yields.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's quarterly results by segment for the last seven quarters can be found in the Company's financial supplement on page 20.
Assurant Solutions
Assurant Solutions third quarter 2009 net operating income was $31.6 million, a 55 percent increase from third quarter 2008 net operating income of $20.4 million. Results for the third quarter of 2008 included a charge of $7.7 million after-tax related to the acquisition of GE's Warranty Management Group. Results for the quarter improved as the domestic combined ratio benefited from favorable underwriting in the service contract business. Net operating income for the first nine months was $89.8 million, down 10 percent from $100.3 million in 2008. Lower investment income and an increase in the international combined ratio due to continued unfavorable credit insurance loss experience in the United Kingdom drove the decrease.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $669.3 million, versus $707.1 million in 2008. Nine-month net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $2.0 billion. Decreases for the quarter and nine months were primarily driven by the application of universal life insurance accounting to new preneed business sold in 2009 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Absent these two factors, net earned premiums for the third quarter of 2009 would have increased 4 percent and premiums for the first nine months of 2009 would have increased 5 percent.
 
Assurant Specialty Property
Assurant Specialty Property third quarter 2009 net operating income was $103.2 million, an increase from third quarter 2008 net operating income of $30.9 million. Net operating income for the first nine months of 2009 was $299.1 million, up 4 percent from $286.7 million in 2008. Improvements for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 were primarily the result of no reportable catastrophe losses. This compares to $94.8 million of reportable catastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums in the third quarter and nine months of 2008. The third quarter 2009 results benefited from a $5.9 million after-tax subrogation reimbursement related to the 2007 California wildfires.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 7 percent, to $478.7 million, as compared to $513.2 million in 2008. Nine-month net earned premiums decreased 5 percent to $1.5 billion. Lower premium from real estate-owned policies, less premium from loans lost due to servicer consolidation and higher reinsurance costs caused the declines.
Assurant Health
Assurant Health reported a net operating loss for the third quarter 2009 of $4.8 million, compared to third quarter 2008 net operating income of $30.2 million. The net operating loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $0.5 million, compared to net operating income of $95.2 million in 2008. Declines for the quarter and nine months reflect high utilization of medical services. The third quarter 2009 results include a charge of $8.1 million after-tax for an unfavorable ruling in a lawsuit.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 3 percent to $470.4 million, compared to $486.7 million in 2008. Nine-month net earned premiums decreased 4 percent to $1.4 billion. Individual medical premiums decreased less than 1 percent for the third quarter and the first nine months, while small group premiums decreased 11 percent for the quarter and 13 percent for the nine-month period. The premium decreases for the quarter and nine months were caused primarily by a continued high level of policy lapses.
Assurant Employee Benefits
Assurant Employee Benefits third quarter 2009 net operating income was $11.5 million, a 47 percent decrease from $21.5 million in third quarter 2008. Net operating income for the nine-month period was $30.6 million, down 46 percent from $56.4 million for the same period in 2008. Less favorable loss experience across all product lines and lower investment income resulted in the declines.
Third quarter 2009 net earned premiums decreased 8 percent versus 2008, to $256 million. The first nine months net earned premiums decreased 6 percent to $782 million. Nine-month results for 2008 included $5.5 million in single premiums from a closed block of business. Premium decreases for the quarter and first nine months of 2009, reflect economic pressures in the small business sector and previously disclosed client losses in the alternative distribution channel.
 
Corporate and Other
Corporate and other net operating loss for the third quarter of 2009 was $9.8 million compared to a loss of $14.8 million in 2008. Third quarter 2008 results were negatively affected by a $4 million increase in tax liabilities. The net operating loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $39.3 million compared to a loss of $39.5 million in 2008.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") increased to $4.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2009. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, increased 9 percent to $40.57 from $37.16 at Dec. 31, 2008 and was up 3 percent from June 30, 2009. AOCI improved by $793.3 million from Dec. 31, 2008, of which $696.9 million was the result of improvements in the investment portfolio. In the third quarter of 2009, Assurant repurchased more than 1.1 million shares for $31.9 million. The annualized operating ROE
2
was 10.7 percent for the quarter and 10.6 percent for the first nine months of 2009. As of Sept. 30, 2009, total assets were $25.7 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 17.0 percent versus 18.3 percent at Dec. 31, 2008.
"In summary, results demonstrate that at our core, Assurant's business model is fundamentally strong and actions to improve performance are taking hold," said Pollock.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals year-to-date net operating income divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding AOCI, and then the return is annualized. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 12.5% and (11.2)%, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 was 13.0% and 9.0%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
