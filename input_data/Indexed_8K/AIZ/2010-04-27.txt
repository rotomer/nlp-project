NEW YORK, April 27, 2010 -- Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, announced today that certain of its subsidiaries have entered into reinsurance agreements providing for $150 million in multi-year, fully collateralized reinsurance from Ibis Re Ltd. ("Ibis Re"), a special purpose reinsurance company domiciled in the Cayman Islands.
Ibis Re financed the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage by issuing $150 million in catastrophe bonds to qualified institutional buyers. As a component of our overall risk management program, the Ibis Re reinsurance consists of two separate layers of coverage for protection against losses from individual hurricane events in Hawaii and along the Gulf and Eastern Coasts of the United States.
"Reinsurance protection financed through the capital markets is strategically important for Assurant as it provides us fully collateralized, multi-year coverage that complements our traditional reinsurance program," said Robert B. Pollock, president and chief executive officer. "We are very pleased with the results of this transaction. We expect to have completed the placement of our 2010 property catastrophe reinsurance program with reinsurers in June. As we have done in the past, we will provide details of the full 2010 program when it is completed."
