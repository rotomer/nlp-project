FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the first quarter 2010.
NEW YORK, April 28, 2010 
"First quarter results reflect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and chief executive officer. "We are encouraged by the progress made to increase revenues, manage expenses and increase profitability. We are mindful that continued high unemployment will temper economic recovery, and healthcare reform will bring about changes in how some of our businesses operate. Our efforts remain focused on creating our own growth opportunities and increasing shareholder value."
First Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income for the first quarter 2010 increased 12 percent to $154.3 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 net operating income of $137.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share. The primary reasons for the increase were the operating results at Assurant Specialty Property and Assurant Employee Benefits.
Net income for the first quarter 2010 increased 95 percent to $157.2 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2009 net income of $80.6 million, or $0.68 per diluted share. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $2.9 million in the quarter, compared to after-tax net realized losses of $36.2 million in first quarter 2009. Net income in the first quarter 2009 also included $21.0 million of tax expense caused by a change in deferred tax assets.
Net earned premiums in the first quarter 2010 were $1.9 billion, up slightly from the first quarter 2009, primarily attributable to growth in Assurant Employee Benefits.
 
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant for first quarter 2010 and first quarter 2009:
 
 
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last five quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
 
Assurant Solutions
 
 
Net operating income decreased versus 2009 due to $2.8 million of tax expense resulting from European business restructuring and a $4.0 million after-tax change in the value of consumer price index caps, instruments that protect against inflation risk in our preneed product. Net operating income benefited from favorable domestic service contract loss experience and favorable results for preneed. The international combined ratio was up modestly for the quarter due to continued poor loss experience in the United Kingdom. However, it improved sequentially due to risk management and restructuring initiatives implemented in 2009.
Net earned premiums were level with the first quarter 2009. International net earned premiums increased by 26 percent due to growth from both new and existing clients as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Domestic net earned premiums declined by 6 percent due to lower service contract sales in 2009 and the continued loss of premiums from former clients that are no longer in business.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
 
Net operating income increased versus 2009 due to improved loss and expense ratios. Results included a $7.6 million after-tax favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review. The loss ratio benefited from favorable non-catastrophe loss experience. There were no reportable catastrophes during the first quarter 2010 or 2009.
Net earned premiums for the quarter increased, primarily due to a $13.6 million adjustment from the unearned premium reserve review.
Assurant Health
 
 
Net operating income decreased versus 2009 due to the higher medical utilization trends experienced over the past year. Loss ratios improved sequentially due to pricing and plan design changes initiated in 2009.
 
Net earned premiums declined slightly with individual medical premiums increasing about $1 million compared to the first quarter 2009 while small group premiums declined $5 million.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
 
Net operating income for the quarter increased significantly versus 2009 due to favorable loss experience. Unusually low disability incidence levels and favorable life insurance results contributed to the improvement.
Net earned premiums increased due to the addition of two new reinsurance clients and the acquisition of a block of business announced in the third quarter 2009.
Corporate & Other
 
 
Net operating loss in the first quarter declined slightly versus 2009. First quarter 2009 results included $4.6 million after-tax of compensation-related expenses.
Share Repurchase Program
The Company repurchased 3.4 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $109.2 million in the first quarter 2010. Through April 23, 2010, year-to-date repurchases totaled 4.8 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $157.3 million, leaving $612.7 million in the Company's repurchase authorization.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), increased to $4.8 billion at March 31, 2010. Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, increased 3 percent to $41.82, from $40.47 at Dec. 31, 2009. AOCI improved by $88.1 million from Dec. 31, 2009. The annualized operating ROE was 12.9 percent for the quarter. As of March 31, 2010, total assets were $26.2 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 16.9 percent at March 31, 2010 versus 17.0 percent at Dec. 31, 2009.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation of net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), and then the return is annualized, if necessary. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 was 12.8% and 8.7%, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 10.1% and 11.5%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding AOCI as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure for this included measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $43.16 as of March 31, 2010, as shown in the reconciliation below.
