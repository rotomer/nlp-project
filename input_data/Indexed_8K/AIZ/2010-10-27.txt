FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
Assurant, Inc. ("Assurant") (NYSE: AIZ), a premier provider of specialty insurance and insurance-related products and services, today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 2010 
"Assurant's disciplined actions to grow revenues, manage expenses and become more efficient are yielding improved results," said Robert B. Pollock, Assurant's president and CEO. "Our businesses are generating strong cash flows and our corporate capital position is continuing to grow. We are well-positioned to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders."
Third Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income
1
for the third quarter 2010 increased 9.1 percent to $137.7 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 net operating income of $126.2 million, or $1.07 per diluted share. All four businesses  Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits  delivered improved results.
Net income for the third quarter 2010 decreased 2.1 percent to $141.7 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to third quarter 2009 net income of $144.7 million, or $1.22 per diluted share. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $4.0 million in the quarter, compared to after-tax net realized gains of $12.9 million in third quarter 2009.
Net earned premiums in the third quarter 2010 decreased 2.2 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion in third quarter 2009, primarily reflecting a decline in premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the third quarter 2010 increased 1.9 percent to $176.2 million, compared to $172.9 million in third quarter 2009, as an increase in invested assets offset the impact of lower investment yields.
 
Nine-Month Results
Net operating income for the first nine months of 2010 increased 22.3 percent to $444.3 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, compared to $363.3 million, or $3.07 per diluted share, in 2009. Results in each business produced year-over-year improvement.
Net income for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10.7 percent to $463.6 million, or $4.11 per diluted share, versus $418.6 million, or $3.54 per diluted share year-to-date 2009. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $19.3 million for the first nine months of 2010, compared to net realized losses of $27.3 million for the same period of 2009. Results for the first nine months of 2010 also include a $17.4 million after-tax benefit from a reserve decrease due to a legal settlement. Net income for the first nine months of 2009 included an $83.5 million benefit from a favorable legal settlement and an $8.1 million after-tax legal charge.
Net earned premiums in the first nine months of 2010 were $5.6 billion, down slightly compared with nine-month 2009 results.
Net investment income for the first nine months of 2010 was $525.4 million, down slightly compared to the first nine months of 2009. Lower investment yields offset the impact of an increase in invested assets.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last seven quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
 
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income was up for the quarter and first nine months of 2010. The international combined ratio declined for the quarter and year to date, reflecting continued improved loss experience. Results also benefited from the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Effective tax rates continue to run higher than in 2009, but decreased from second quarter 2010. The domestic combined ratio increased in the third quarter 2010 due to less favorable loss experience in extended service contracts.
Net earned premiums decreased for the quarter and first nine months of 2010, primarily due to the discontinuation of domestic service contract sales in 2009 from former clients that are no longer in business and continued run-off of domestic credit business. Partially offsetting the decline, international net earned premiums increased for the quarter and first nine months due to new and existing client growth as well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Preneed fee income increased, reflecting increased sales primarily in Canada.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income increased for the quarter and first nine months of 2010 reflecting an improved combined ratio. Third quarter 2010 results include no reportable catastrophes. Results for the first nine months of 2010 include a $7.6 million after-tax favorable unearned premium reserve adjustment and $5.0 million after-tax of reportable catastrophe losses compared to no reportable catastrophes during 2009. Third quarter 2009 results included a $5.9 million favorable after-tax subrogation reimbursement.
Net earned premiums increased slightly for the quarter and first nine months of 2010. The growth in creditor-placed homeowners and other premiums, including creditor-placed flood and renters, was offset by increased ceded premiums and lower real estate-owned premiums. Year-to-date 2010 results include a $13.6 million favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
 
Assurant Health
 
NM = Not Meaningful
Net operating income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased due to improved loss ratios, reflecting pricing and plan design changes implemented to address higher medical utilization trends. Third quarter 2010 results include a $5.0 million after-tax restructuring charge. Third quarter 2009 results included an $8.1 million after-tax legal charge. Results for the first nine months of 2010 benefited from a $17.4 million after-tax reserve decrease due to a legal settlement.
Net earned premiums decreased slightly for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 due to a decline in small group and short-term medical premiums. Individual medical premiums increased slightly for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income for the quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased due to favorable loss experience. Results for the quarter and nine months benefited from very low disability incidence and favorable life mortality rates. Yearto-date results include a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge compared to a $1.5 million restructuring charge in 2009.
Net earned premiums increased for the quarter and first nine months of 2010, reflecting both the acquisition of a block of business and reinsurance clients added in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased primarily due to increases in tax, compensation and pension-related costs.
Capital Position
The Company repurchased 1.2 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $44.9 million in the third quarter 2010. Year to date, through Sept. 30, 2010, the company repurchased 10.7 million shares for $369.2 million, with $400.9 million remaining in the repurchase authorization. During the third quarter 2010, corporate capital increased to approximately $710 million from about $575 million at June 30, 2010.
 
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), increased to $4.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2010, from $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2009. The book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 10.4 percent to $44.67, from $40.47 at Dec. 31, 2009. AOCI of $514.7 million improved by $449 million from Dec. 31, 2009. The annualized operating return on equity ("ROE")
3
was 11.5 percent for the quarter. As of Sept. 30, 2010, total assets were approximately $27 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, improved to 16.8 percent at Sept. 30, 2010, versus 17 percent at Dec. 31, 2009, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.6 to 1.

Regulation G  Non GAAP Financial Measures
Assurant uses the following non-GAAP financial measures to analyze the Company's operating performance for the periods presented in this financial supplement. Because Assurant's calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, investors should be careful when comparing Assurant's non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.
(1) Assurant uses net operating income as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Net operating income equals net income, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and unusual and/or infrequent items. The Company believes net operating income provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes both the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable from period to period, and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. Please refer to page 5 for a reconciliation of net operating income to net income.
(2) Assurant uses annualized operating ROE as an important measure of the Company's operating performance. Annualized operating ROE equals net operating income for the periods presented divided by average stockholders' equity for the year to date period, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), and then the return is annualized, if necessary. The Company believes annualized operating ROE provides investors a valuable measure of the performance of the Company's ongoing business, because it excludes the effect of net realized gains (losses) on investments that tend to be highly variable and those events that are unusual and/or unlikely to recur. The comparable GAAP measure would be annualized GAAP return on equity, defined as the annualized return of net income divided by average stockholders' equity for the period. Consolidated GAAP ROE for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 was 10.9% and 12.5%, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 was 12.1% and 13.0%, respectively. Segment ROEs are measured consistently with GAAP. Please refer to page 6 for the reconciliation of annualized operating ROE to annualized GAAP return on average equity.
(3) Assurant uses book value per diluted share excluding AOCI as an important measure of the Company's stockholder value. Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI equals total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by diluted shares outstanding. The company believes book value per diluted share excluding AOCI provides investors a valuable measure of stockholder value because it excludes the effect of unrealized gains (losses) on investments which tend to be highly variable from period to period and other comprehensive income items. The comparable GAAP measure would be book value per diluted share defined as total stockholders' equity divided by diluted shares outstanding. Book value per diluted share was $49.41 as of September 30, 2010, as shown in the reconciliation below.
