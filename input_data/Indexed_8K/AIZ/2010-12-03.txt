Item 2.06.    Material Impairments
 
On December 2, 2010, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") concluded that it will take a charge of approximately $31.3 million after-tax in the fourth quarter of 2010 for the impairment of an intangible asset. This asset was established for a domestic service contract client of the Company's Assurant Solutions segment as part of a previously disclosed 2008 acquisition.
The impairment charge results from the Company's receipt, on November 30, 2010, of notice that the client would not renew its contract with the Company after June 1, 2011. The Company expects the lapse of the contract to have a positive impact on Assurant Solutions' profitability in 2011 as the associated business runs off. No portion of the impairment charge will result in future cash expenditures.
