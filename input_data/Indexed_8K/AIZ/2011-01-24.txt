Item 2.06.    Material Impairments
 
The information disclosed under Item 8.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On January 21, 2011, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") concluded that it will take a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $306.4 million (after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2010. This conclusion was made in connection with the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing in accordance with ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other."
The impairment charge relates to the goodwill of the Company's Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments. Factors underlying the impairment charge include the effects of health care reform, the low interest rate environment, continuing high unemployment and the slow pace of the economic recovery.
The Company does not expect the non-cash charge to affect the Company's business operations, cash flow or regulatory capital ratios, or to result in future cash expenditures.
