Fourth Quarter 2010 Results
Net operating income
1
for the fourth quarter 2010 increased 14 percent to $115.8 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2009 net operating income of $101.6 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, due to improvements at Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits. The quarter included a $30.9 million after-tax intangible asset impairment at Assurant Solutions.
Net loss for the fourth quarter 2010 was $184.4 million, or $(1.74) per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2009 net income of $11.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. The fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009 include goodwill impairment charges of $306.4 million and $83.0 million, respectively. The goodwill impairment charges are not tax-deductible. Fourth quarter 2010 and 2009 include changes in the tax valuation allowance.
Net earned premiums in the fourth quarter 2010 decreased 6 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion in fourth quarter 2009, primarily reflecting a decline in premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income in the fourth quarter 2010 increased 3 percent to $177.8 million, compared to $172.5 million in fourth quarter 2009, as total invested assets remained stable and yields improved slightly.
Twelve-Month Results
Net operating income for 2010 increased 20 percent to $560.1 million, or $5.02 per diluted share, compared to $464.9 million, or $3.92 per diluted share, in 2009. Results at Assurant Specialty Property, Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits produced year-over-year improvement.
Net income for the year decreased 35 percent to $279.2 million, or $2.50 per diluted share, versus $430.6 million, or $3.63 per diluted share for the same period in 2009. The goodwill impairment charges significantly impacted net income in each year. After-tax net realized gains on investments were $31.5 million for full-year 2010, compared to net realized losses of $34.8 million in 2009. Net income for 2009 included an $83.5 million after-tax benefit from a favorable legal settlement.
Net earned premiums for 2010 were $7.4 billion, down from $7.6 billion in 2009, primarily due to reduced premiums at Assurant Solutions.
Net investment income for 2010 was $703.2 million, compared to $698.8 million for 2009. Invested assets increased but were offset by lower investment yields.
The following chart provides a reconciliation of net operating income to net income for Assurant:
 
A schedule of disclosed items that affected Assurant's results by business for the last eight quarters is available on page 19 of the Company's Financial Supplement, which is available at www.assurant.com.
Assurant Solutions
 
Net operating income decreased for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 from a $30.9 million after-tax intangible asset impairment in the domestic service contract business. Absent this charge, net operating income for the quarter and year increased driven by improved international and preneed performance. The international combined ratio improved for the quarter and full-year 2010 mainly from improved loss experience, primarily in the UK. International results included $8.4 million after-tax of restructuring charges in 2009. In 2010 the domestic combined ratio increased in the fourth quarter and full year, reflecting the intangible asset impairment and less favorable results from former clients no longer in business.
Net earned premiums decreased for the quarter and full-year 2010, primarily due to reduced domestic service contract sales in 2009 from former clients that are no longer in business and the continued run-off of the domestic credit business. International net earned premiums increased in full-year 2010 as a result of new and existing client growth, primarily in Latin America. Preneed fee income increased for the quarter and the year primarily because of strong growth in Canada.
Assurant Specialty Property
 
Net operating income in fourth quarter 2010 declined primarily due to $9.8 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses arising from Arizona wind and hailstorms. Reportable catastrophe losses were $14.8 million after-tax during 2010, compared to no reportable catastrophes in 2009. Full-year 2010 net operating income was up due to lower expenses. Results for 2010 include a $7.6 million after-tax favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
Net earned premiums decreased slightly for the quarter and were flat for full-year 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in ceded premiums. Growth in lender-placed homeowners, flood and renters premiums in the quarter and for full-year 2010 partially offset the decline. Results for 2010 include a $13.6 million favorable adjustment from an unearned premium reserve review.
Assurant Health
 
NM = Not Meaningful
Net operating income was up for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 due to reduced expense ratios and improved loss ratios reflecting pricing and plan design changes. Restructuring charges totaled $3.8 million after-tax in the fourth quarter and $8.8 million for full-year 2010. Full-year 2010 net operating income includes a $17.4 million after-tax benefit from a reserve decrease related to a legal settlement, compared to $32.1 million of after-tax legal charges in 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 results included $29.4 million after-tax of legal, restructuring and H1N1-related medical charges.
Net earned premiums decreased in the quarter and for the year resulting from a decline in small group and short-term medical premiums. Individual medical premiums were flat for the fourth quarter and up for full-year 2010.
Assurant Employee Benefits
 
Net operating income for the fourth quarter and full-year 2010 increased due to favorable loss experience in all product lines. Favorable disability results and life mortality, as well as dental pricing actions, contributed to the improvement. Results for the year include a $4.4 million after-tax restructuring charge versus $2.5 million after-tax of restructuring charges for 2009.
Net earned premiums decreased slightly for the quarter. Net earned premiums increased for full-year 2010 as a result of the acquisition of a block of business and reinsurance clients added in fourth quarter 2009.
Corporate & Other
 
Net operating loss in the fourth quarter and year increased primarily due to compensation and pension-related costs.
Goodwill Impairment
As disclosed on Jan. 24, 2011, following the completion of its annual goodwill impairment analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $306.4 million to net income, or $2.86 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2010. The goodwill impairment charge at Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits resulted from the effects of healthcare reform, the low interest rate environment, continuing high unemployment and the slow pace of the economic recovery. The charge does not impact cash flow from operations.
Capital Position
Assurant repurchased 4.5 million of its outstanding common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $163.8 million during the fourth quarter 2010. For full-year 2010, the Company repurchased 15.2 million shares totaling $533.0 million. In 2011, through Jan. 31, the Company repurchased an additional 1.7 million shares for $65.7 million, with $772.4 million remaining in the repurchase authorization.
During the fourth quarter 2010, corporate capital increased to approximately $880 million from $710 million at Sept. 30, 2010.
Financial Position
Stockholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), decreased to $4.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2010, from $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2009.
Book value per diluted share
2
, excluding AOCI, increased 6.4 percent to $43.08, from $40.47 at Dec. 31, 2009. AOCI of $285.5 million improved by $219.6 million from Dec. 31, 2009 primarily due to additional net unrealized gains in invested assets.
The operating return on equity ("ROE")
3
was 12.1 percent for the full-year 2010, compared to 10.1 percent in 2009.
As of Dec. 31, 2010, total assets were approximately $26.4 billion. The ratio of debt to total capital, excluding AOCI, was 17.9 percent at Dec. 31, 2010, compared to 17 percent at Dec. 31, 2009, while the asset leverage ratio was 2.8 to 1.
