In consideration of the mutual promises and covenants made herein and the mutual benefits to be derived herefrom, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. . (a) . Subject to the provisions of this Award Agreement (this "Agreement") and the provisions of the Amended and Restated Assurant, Inc. Long Term Equity Incentive Plan (the ""), the Company hereby grants to the Participant, as of (the ""), Restricted Stock Units (the ""), each with respect to one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per Share (""). All capitalized terms used herein, to the extent not defined, shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.

Restricted Stock Units
Common Stock
(b) . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units shall vest, and shall no longer be subject to any restriction, in three substantially equal annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Grant Date.
Vesting during the Restriction Period
(c) . Upon the Participant's Termination of Employment for any reason other than Retirement (as defined below), death or Disability during the Restriction Period, all Restricted Stock Units still subject to restriction shall be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period due to the Participant's Retirement, the restrictions applicable to any Restricted Stock Units shall immediately lapse, and such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested; and (ii) upon the Participant's Termination of Employment during the Restriction Period due to death or Disability, the Participant shall vest in, and the Restricted Period shall terminate with respect to, a number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the total number of Restricted Stock Units and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months in the Restriction Period from the Grant Date until the date of Termination of Employment ( that, for this purpose, the month in which the Grant Date occurs shall be considered a full month) and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the Restriction Period over (B) the number of Restricted Stock Units that previously vested as of the Termination of Employment without respect to this provision. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with, or the performance of services for, the Company shall include employment with, or the performance of services for, the Company's Affiliates and its successors. Nothing in this Agreement or the Plan shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its Affiliates, or to continue to perform services for the Company or any of its Affiliates, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any such Affiliates to
Forfeiture; Termination of Employment
provided
terminate the Participant's employment or performance of services at any time. For purposes of this Agreement, "Retirement" shall mean the Participant's "separation from service" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) on or after the date on which the Participant has reached at least age 55 and completed at least 5 consecutive years of service on the Board.
2. . As soon as practicable after the date on which the Restriction Period expires, and in no event later than 30 calendar days after such date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant or his or her personal representative, in book-position or certificate form, one Share that does not bear any restrictive legend for each vested Restricted Stock Unit.
Settlement of Units
3. . The Participant shall have the right to receive Dividend Equivalents with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units that are outstanding under this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents represent the right to receive an amount equal to the aggregate regular cash dividends that would have been paid to the Participant if the Participant had been the record owner, on each record date for a cash dividend during the period from the Grant Date through the date on which the applicable Restricted Stock Units are settled, cancelled or forfeited of a number of Shares equal to the applicable number of Restricted Stock Units that vest pursuant to this Agreement. The Dividend Equivalents shall be paid, in cash, as soon as practicable, but in no event more than 45 calendar days following, the applicable record date for each such cash dividend.
Dividend Equivalents
4. . During the Restriction Period and until such time as the Restricted Stock Units are ultimately settled as provided in Section 2 above, the Restricted Stock Units and the Shares covered by the Restricted Stock Units shall not be transferable by the Participant by means of sale, assignment, exchange, encumbrance, pledge, hedge or otherwise. Any purported or attempted transfer of such Shares or such rights shall be null and void.
Nontransferability of the Restricted Stock Units
5. . During the Restriction Period, the Participant shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (including, without limitation, any voting rights).
Rights as a Stockholder
6. . In the event of certain transactions during the Restricted Period, the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.4 of the Plan or any applicable successor provision under the Plan. In the event of a Change of Control before the Restricted Stock Units vest, the restrictions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units shall lapse, such Restricted Stock Units shall become free of all restrictions and become fully vested, consistent with Section 9.1 of the Plan, and shall be settled within 5 calendar days following the Change of Control; , that any Restricted Stock Units that constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code shall not be settled upon such Change of Control unless the Change of Control constitutes a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and will instead be settled at such time as specified in Section 2.
Adjustment; Change of Control
provided, however
7. . The Company agrees to pay any and all original issue taxes and stock transfer taxes that may be imposed on the
Payment of Transfer Taxes, Fees and Other Expenses
 
issuance of shares received by a Participant in connection with the Restricted Stock Units, together with any and all other fees and expenses necessarily incurred by the Company in connection therewith.
8. . No later than the date as of which an amount first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for federal, state, local, foreign income, employment or other tax purposes with respect to any Restricted Stock Units, the Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, all federal, state, local and foreign taxes that are required by applicable laws and regulations to be withheld with respect to such amount. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 8, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to the Participant, including deducting such amount from the delivery of shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units that gives rise to the withholding requirement.
Taxes and Withholding
9. . Notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be given by hand delivery to the other party or by facsimile, overnight courier, or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:
Notices
If to the Participant:

Attention: Secretary
or to such other address or facsimile number as any party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance with this Section 9. Notices and communications shall be effective when actually received by the addressee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Participant consents to electronic delivery of documents required to be delivered by the Company under the securities laws.
10. . This Agreement is personal to the Participant and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Participant's legal representatives. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
Effect of Agreement
11. . The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws, as applied to contracts executed in and performed wholly within the State of Delaware. In addition to the terms and
Laws Applicable to Construction; Consent to Jurisdiction
 
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Restricted Stock Units are subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
12. . If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement are held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included.
Severability
13. . In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. In the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, or any matters as to which this Agreement is silent, the Plan shall govern including, without limitation, the provisions thereof pursuant to which the Committee has the power, among others, to (a) interpret the Plan, (b) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and (c) make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. The Participant and the Company each acknowledges that this Agreement (together with the Plan) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or either of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Conflicts and Interpretation
14. . The Company may modify, amend or waive the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such modification, amendment or waiver shall materially impair the rights of the Participant without his or her consent, except as required by applicable law, stock exchange rules, tax rules or accounting rules. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement.
Amendment
15. . It is the intention of the Company that the Restricted Stock Units shall either (a) not constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code or (b) comply in all respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, such that no delivery of Shares pursuant to this Agreement will result in the imposition of taxation or penalties as a consequence of the application of Section 409A of the Code. Shares in respect of any Restricted Stock Units that (i) constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" as defined under Section 409A of the Code and (ii) vest as a consequence of the Participant's termination of employment shall not be delivered until the date that the Participant incurs a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (or, if the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the date that is six months following the date of such "separation from service"). If the Company determines after the Grant Date that an amendment to this Agreement is necessary to ensure the foregoing, it may, notwithstanding Section 14, make such an amendment, effective as of the Grant Date or any later date, without the consent of the Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or the Plan, in the event that any taxes or penalties are imposed on the Participant by reason of Section 409A of the Code, the Participant acknowledges and agrees that such taxes or penalties shall be the exclusive obligation of the Participant, and the Company shall have no liability therefor.
Section 409A of the Code
 
16. . The headings of Sections herein are included solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Headings
17. . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, which together shall constitute one and the same original.
Counterparts
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, as of the date first above written, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf by a duly authorized officer and the Participant has hereunto set the Participant's hand.
