Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
On February 7, 2012, Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") and two of its insurance company subsidiaries (American Security Insurance Company and American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida) received subpoenas from the New York Department of Financial Services (the "NYDFS") regarding its lender-placed insurance business and related document retention practices.
The Company received the subpoenas as it was completing its production of information concerning the lender-placed business requested by the NYDFS in October 2011. Although the Company respectfully disagrees with the NYDFS's position concerning its document retention practices, the Company has modified its practices in accordance with such interpretation pending resolution of the matter.
The Company is committed to cooperating fully and continuing to work with the NYDFS to resolve this matter.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
