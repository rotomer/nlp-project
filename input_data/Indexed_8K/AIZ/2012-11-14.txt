Item 2.05.    Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
On November 14, 2012, Assurant Solutions, a segment of Assurant, Inc. (the "Company"), notified employees of workforce reductions as part of its overall efforts to reduce operating expenses and increase organizational efficiencies.
These workforce reductions are primarily in the segment's domestic credit insurance/debt deferment business and also include reductions in the U.K./European operations. This process is expected to be completed by year-end 2012 and the Company estimates that severance and outplacement costs will result in an after-tax charge of approximately $7.3 million to consolidated and segment fourth quarter net income. The Company expects substantially all of this charge to result in future cash expenditures in the approximate amount described above.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT - Some of the statements included in this Form 8-K, particularly those projecting the timing and amount of workforce reduction charges, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results and timing may differ materially from those projected herein due to numerous factors, including the Company's ability to implement these reductions as planned, effective tax rates and unanticipated charges that may occur as a result of these actions. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 8-K as a result of new information or future events or developments. For a detailed discussion of risk factors that could affect our results, please refer to the risk factors identified in our annual and periodic reports, including but not limited to our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Third Quarter 2012 Form 10-Q, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
