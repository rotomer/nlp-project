Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
Assurant, Inc. (the "Company") has estimated the reportable catastrophe losses related to Superstorm Sandy to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. The principal cause of loss was flood, along with wind and water damage. The largest concentration of losses occurred in the coastal communities of New York and New Jersey. Based on the above estimate, the Company does not expect to exceed the retention limit of its 2012 property catastrophe reinsurance program.
The Company's reportable catastrophe losses include only individual catastrophic events that generate losses in excess of $5 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance. Superstorm Sandy is the only reportable loss event in the fourth quarter of 2012 to date. Actual losses from the storm will be reported in the fourth quarter 2012 earnings release expected for February 6, 2013 after 4:00 p.m. ET.
