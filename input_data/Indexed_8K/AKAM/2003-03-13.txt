Item 5. Other Events.
     On February 28, 2003, we settled a lawsuit filed against us in June 2001 by a former employee alleging breach of contract. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to make a $3.55 million payment, of which $1.75 million will be reimbursed by our insurance carriers. We have recorded the net amount of $1.8 million as general and administrative expenses, increased other current assets by $1.75 million and increased accrued expenses by $3.55 million as of December 31, 2002.
     On January 28, 2003, we issued a press release that included our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2002 and unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. On that date, we also held a telephone conference with the investing public to review those financial results during which we announced that we had positive earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. Subsequent to the date of the press release and the telephone conference, the parties participated in a mediation that resulted in the settlement. Accordingly, we recorded adjustments to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002. Furthermore, as a result of the adjustments above, our EBITDA was materially reduced by $1.8 million. EBITDA is, however, an unaudited financial metric that could be subject to additional adjustments over time. A revised reconciliation of net loss calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America to normalized net loss and EBITDA, giving effect only to the adjustments related to settlement of this lawsuit, is available on our web site at www.akamai.com. We are not including the information contained on our web site as part of, or incorporating by reference into, this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     Set forth below is a reconciliation from our consolidated financial statements included in our press release on January 28, 2003 to the adjusted consolidated financial statements.
