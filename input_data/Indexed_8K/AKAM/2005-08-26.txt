EXHIBIT 99.3 SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2004 AND 2003
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT Board of Directors and Stockholders of Speedera Networks, Inc. We have audited the balance sheet of Speedera Networks, Inc. as of June 30, 2004, and the related statements of operations, mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of Speedera Networks, Inc. as of June 30, 2003, were audited by other auditors whose report dated September 30, 2003, except for Note 12, which is as of November 21, 2003, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the 2004 financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Speedera Networks, Inc. at June 30, 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. THE COMPANY Speedera Networks, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Delaware on October 12, 1999. The Company provides services, powered by a next-generation internet content distribution network with global traffic management, through a subscription service. The Company's services are primarily designed to resolve network congestion by routing internet traffic and delivering content and transactions around busy or failed network segments. The Company has completed several rounds of private equity financing and debt financing. Since inception through June 30, 2004, the Company has incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations. Management expected and has reached operating cash flow breakeven in fiscal 2004, however, they cannot guarantee that operating income and positive cash flows will continue in the foreseeable future because of additional costs and expenses related to marketing and other promotional activities, continued expansion of operations, continued development of the Company's software, web site and information technology infrastructure, expansion of product offerings and development of relationships with other businesses. Failure to generate sufficient revenues, raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to achieve its intended business objectives. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates used in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, allowance for doubtful accounts, contingencies, depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and capitalized software and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue from content delivery and streaming services based on the amount of data delivered and stored on its network. The service agreements generally commit the customer to a monthly minimum commitment plus additional fees for usage above the minimum commitment. Revenue is recognized for the greater of the actual usage or the monthly minimum commitment when all of the following conditions are met: the customer has signed a contract, the service has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue from other services such as load balancing, monitoring and hosting is recognized each month, as performed, for the duration of the applicable contract provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and 1
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS collection is reasonably assured. The Company records installation and set-up fees as deferred revenue and recognizes these fees ratably over the life of the customer contract. COST OF REVENUE Cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and housing servers in third-party network data centers. Cost of revenue also includes network operation employee costs and cost of licenses. The Company enters into bandwidth contracts with third-party providers that generally commit the Company to pay minimum monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above the committed usage. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The Company is subject to all of the risks inherent to a company conducting content distribution services over the Internet. These risks include, but are not limited to, a limited operating history, ability to generate profitable operations or to obtain additional financing, limited management resources, dependence upon consumer acceptance of the Internet and the changing nature of the content distribution services industry. The Company's operating results may be materially affected by the foregoing factors. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The reported amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amounts of notes payable approximate fair value because the contractual interest rates approximate the interest rates the Company could obtain on similar financing transactions. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are deposited with two major financial institutions in the United States of America. At times, such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the Company's investments in cash equivalents are financially sound and have minimal credit risk. The Company's accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. For the years ended June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's total revenues. At June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable. 2
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate consisting of specifically identified accounts receivable which management believes may be partially or wholly un-collectible and a general reserve based on the Company's experience in collecting customer accounts receivables. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain software development costs associated with internal use software. These costs are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1 and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00 - 02, which require these costs to be charged to operations until certain capitalization criteria are met. During the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, software development costs of approximately $502,000 and $448,000, respectively, were capitalized and included in property and equipment. Total amortization of software development costs for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $781,000 and $994,000, respectively. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying from the asset. There have been no such impairments of long-lived assets as of June 30, 2004. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $61,000 and $70,000, respectively. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of 3
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS accounting for stock-based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. During the year ended June 30, 2004, there were no stock based awards to non-employees. Employee stock awards under the Company's compensation plans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, including FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25), and related interpretations. The Company also provides the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and related interpretations thereof. Had compensation expense for the Company's stock-based compensation plan been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for the awards under a method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income (loss) for the periods presented would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands): These pro forma amounts may not be representative of the effects on pro forma net income (loss) for future years as options vest over several years and additional awards are generally made each year. Stock-based awards to nonemployees are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. Compensation expense resulting from non-employee options is amortized under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans - An Interpretation of APB Opinions No. 15 and 25, as amended. 4
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STOCK OPTION PLAN On October 12, 1999, the Company adopted the "1999 Equity Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"). The Plan provides for the granting of stock options to employees and consultants of the Company. Options granted under the Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Incentive stock options ("ISOs") may be granted only to Company employees (including officers and directors who are also employees). Non-qualified stock options ("NSOs") may be granted to Company employees and consultants. As of June 30, 2004, the Company had reserved approximately 51,189,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan (see also Note 11). Options under the Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years and at prices no less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that (i) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO shall not be less than 100% and 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, respectively, and (ii) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO granted to a 10% shareholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options may have a maximum term of up to 10 years as determined by the Board of Directors. To date, options granted generally vest over four years. The following table summarizes activity under the Plan: 5
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The options outstanding and exercisable by exercise price at June 30, 2004 are as follows: At June 30, 2004 approximately 13,604,000 options were exercisable. The fair value of each employee option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value method with the following assumptions: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) For the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, there was no difference between net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain amounts reported in prior year have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. 6
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS 4. INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes is summarized below: 7
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The components of net deferred tax assets are as follows: Management believes that, based on a number of factors, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2004 and June 30, 2003. The Company's actual tax provision differs from the expected federal rate of 34% due primarily to state taxes of approximately $80,000, meals & entertainment of approximately $18,000, warrants of approximately $17,000 and the net change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets net of true-up of approximately $(408,000). As of June 30, 2004, the Company had approximately $29 million and $28 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income, respectively. The federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in 2020 and 2008, respectively. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amount of benefit from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that the Company may utilize in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over a three year period. 5. BORROWINGS SUBORDINATED LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT In April 2000, the Company entered into a subordinated loan and security agreement to borrow up to $5 million, in minimum advances of $250,000, at an interest rate of 12% per annum under which the Company borrowed the maximum aggregate amount. In March 2001, an agreement was made to amend the original terms of the subordinated loan and 8
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS security agreement. Pursuant to these amended terms, $2 million of the then outstanding principal was converted into shares of Series B mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.233 per share. The remaining principal balance of approximately $2.7 million was to be payable in monthly installments commencing on January 1, 2003 and any unpaid principal and interest was due in full on June 1, 2004. Accrued interest of approximately $298,000, for the months of February 2001 through December 2001 was paid in Series B preferred stock at a conversion rate of $0.233 per share. The remaining interest was to be paid in cash. In connection with this subordinated loan and security agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase shares of Series B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (Note 7). In January 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the subordinated loan and security agreement. Pursuant to this termination, approximately $468,000 was paid in cash and approximately $272,000 was converted into shares of Series C mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.091 per share. The remaining principal and accrued interest of approximately $2.0 million was forgiven by the lender and recorded as a gain on the debt restructuring. The remaining unamortized loan fee of approximately $185,000 was offset to the gain on debt restructuring. PROMISSORY NOTE In May 2000, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement to borrow up to $10 million at an interest rate of 10.75% per annum under which the Company borrowed approximately $8.1 million. In March 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to amend the original terms of the promissory note. Pursuant to these amended terms, $2 million of the then outstanding principal was converted into shares of Series B mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.233 per share and approximately $408,000 of accrued interest converted into outstanding principal resulting in a note balance of approximately $6.5 million. Pursuant to the amended terms, interest was due and payable quarterly commencing on January 1, 2002. Principal was to be paid in cash in eighteen equal monthly installments beginning on January 1, 2003. In connection with this note, the Company issued a warrant to purchase shares of Series B mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (Note 7). In January 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to further amend the original terms of the promissory note. Pursuant to these amended terms, $700,000 was paid in cash and approximately $3.4 million of the then outstanding principal and interest was forgiven by the lender and recorded as a gain on debt restructuring, resulting in a note balance of approximately $3 million. The unamortized debt discount of approximately $245,000 was offset to the gain on debt restructuring. In November 2002, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the promissory note. Pursuant to this termination, $700,000 was paid in cash and approximately $2.6 million of the remaining outstanding principal and interest was forgiven by the lender and recorded as a gain on debt restructuring. The unamortized debt discount of approximately $172,000 was offset to the gain on debt restructuring. 9
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CREDIT FACILITIES In November 2003, the Company entered into a credit facility agreement with a bank. This agreement consists of an accounts receivable revolver, with maximum borrowings equal to the lesser of 80% of eligible receivables or $1.5 million, a non-formula term loan of $500,000, and a term loan of $500,000 collateralised by equipment purchases. The accounts receivable revolver bears interest equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time, plus three percent per annum, provided that the interest rate in effect on any day shall not be less than seven percent per annum. The non-formula term loan and the term loan bear interest at seven percent. The accounts receivable revolver expires in November 2004. The non-formula term loan and term loan mature in January 2006 and November 2006, respectively. As of June 30, 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under the accounts receivable revolver and an outstanding balance of approximately $396,000 and $403,000 under the non-formula term loan and the term loan, respectively. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants, with which the Company was in compliance at June 30, 2004. In May 2004, an agreement was made to amend the original terms of the credit facility agreement above. In addition to the above loans the bank made a non-formula term loan (No. 2) of an amount not to exceed $1 million and a non-formula term loan (No. 3) of an amount not to exceed $500,000 to the Company. As of June 30, 2004, the outstanding balance for non-formula term loan No. 2 was $1 million and matures in June 2007. The non-formula term loan No. 3 shall be made in a single advance after September 16, 2004 and prior to March 31, 2005 given all terms and conditions are met (See note 11). Borrowings under these loans bear interest at a fixed rate equal to the prime rate in effect as of the date of the advance, plus three percent per annum, provided that the interest rate in effect on any day shall not be less than seven percent per annum. In conjunction with the November 2003 and May 2004 credit facilities with a bank, in addition to accounts receivable, substantially all of the Company's equipment and registered patents and trademarks are being used as collateral. Further, in conjunction with the November 2003 credit facility and May 2004 credit facility amendment, the Company issued warrants to the bank (Note 7). Principal payments under the bank loans are as follows: 10
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES BANDWIDTH USAGE AND CO-LOCATION COMMITMENTS The Company has commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with network service providers that expire at various dates through 2005. For the year ending June 30, 2005, the minimum commitment is approximately $3,195,000. Some of these agreements may be amended to either increase or decrease the minimum commitments during the life of the contract. LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases its principal operating facilities under noncancelable operating leases. Rent expense was approximately $503,000 and $495,000 for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows (see also Note 11): CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION In June 2002, a competitor filed suit in California Superior Court against the Company, alleging theft of its trade secrets from an independent company that provides website performance testing services. In October 2002, the Company filed a cross-claim against the competitor seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief and alleging that the competitor engaged in various unfair trade practices, made false and misleading statements and engaged in unfair competition. In fiscal 2002 and 2003, the competitor filed suits against the Company for violations of certain patents held by the competitor. The Company has filed counterclaims in these cases, including that the competitor has infringed a patent that was issued to the Company. In January 2004, another competitor filed suit in United States District Court in Delaware against the Company, alleging infringement of certain patents held by the competitor. The Company filed a counterclaim against the competitor alleging infringement of certain patents held by the Company. The Company's management believe that they have meritorious defenses and counterclaims, and intend to vigorously defend these actions. During the year ended June 30, 2004, the Company incurred approximately $4 million in legal fees to defend the above 11
SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS claims. The outcome is not known at this time and accordingly no amounts have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements. The Company is involved in various other lawsuits and claims arising from the conduct of its business. The Company's management believes that the disposition of these matters will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Company. INDEMNIFICATIONS FIN No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others , requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. As of June 30, 2004 and 2003, the Company's management believes the fair value of guarantees the Company issued or modified after December 31, 2002 were nominal. In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its services, the Company indemnifies other parties, including business partners, customers, lessors, preferred stock holders and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with an agent and an employee, and the Company's bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to the Company's officers and directors. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure or amount under these indemnification agreements due to the Company having no prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. However, the Company has an errors and omissions insurance policy that may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. 7. WARRANTS WARRANT ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SUBORDINATED LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT In April 2000, the Company issued a warrant to purchase shares of Series B mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.233 per share.

These warrants expire seven years from date of grant. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model applying expected lives of four years, a weighted average risk free rate of 4.17%, a dividend yield of zero percent and volatility of 80%. The fair value of approximately $90,000 represents loan fees on the loan and is being amortized over the credit term. During the year ended June 30, 2004, approximately $35,000 was amortized.

In May 2004, the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of Series C mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.091 per share in conjunction with services rendered in connection with a credit facility. These warrants expire seven years from date of grant. The Company valued the warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model applying expected lives of four years, a weighted average risk free rate of 3.45%, a dividend yield of zero percent and volatility of 80%.

The purchase price of the preferred stock for warrants issued in November 2003 and May 2004 is based on the holder being able to convert into the most recent round of financing or the next round of financing. In the event that the next round of financing, if any, is priced at below the holder's conversion price of $0.091 per share, then the Company would be required to issue additional warrants such that the holder maintains the same level of valuation. 8.

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION Speedera Networks, Inc (the "Company" or "Speedera") was incorporated in the state of Delaware on October 12, 1999. The Company provides Internet content distribution services with global traffic management through a subscription service. The Company's services are primarily designed to resolve network congestion by routing internet traffic and delivering content and transactions around busy or failed network segments. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Speedera and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, these unaudited statements include all adjustments and accruals consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of all interim periods reported herein. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future periods. NOTE 2 - CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivables. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are deposited with two major financial institutions in the United States of America. At times, such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the Company's investments in cash and cash equivalents have minimal credit risk and the financial institutions that hold the Company's cash and cash equivalents are of high credit standing. The Company's accounts receivables are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of the Company's total revenues. At March 31, 2004, one customer accounted for 15% of accounts receivable. At March 31, 2005, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable. NOTE 3 - ACCRUED EXPENSES Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): NOTE 4 - BORROWINGS CREDIT FACILITIES In November 2003, the Company entered into a credit facility agreement with a bank. This agreement consists of an accounts receivable revolver, with maximum borrowings equal to the lesser of 80% of eligible receivables or $1.5 million, a non-formula term loan of $500,000, and a term loan of $500,000 collateralized by equipment purchases. The accounts receivable revolver bears interest equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time, plus three percent per annum, provided that the interest rate in effect on any day shall not be less than seven percent per annum. The non-formula term loan and the term loan bear interest at seven percent. The accounts receivable revolver expired in November 2004. The non-formula term loan and term loan mature in January 2006 and
November 2006, respectively. In connection with the acquisition of Speedera by Akamai, the credit facility agreement was terminated. Borrowings under these loans bear interest at a fixed rate equal to the prime rate in effect as of the date of the advance, plus three percent per annum, provided that the interest rate in effect on any day shall not be less than seven percent per annum. In conjunction with the November 2003 and May 2004 credit facilities with a bank, in addition to accounts receivable, substantially all of the Company's equipment and registered patents and trademarks were being used as collateral. Further, in conjunction with the November 2003 credit facility and May 2004 credit facility amendment, the Company issued warrants to the bank. In May 2004, an agreement was made to amend the original terms of the credit facility agreement above. In addition to the above loans the bank made a non-formula term loan (No. 2) of an amount not to exceed $1 million and a non-formula term loan (No. 3) of an amount not to exceed $500,000 to the Company. As of June 10, 2005, all borrowings under the credit facility were repaid as part of the merger agreement with Akamai Technologies, Inc. NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES BANDWIDTH USAGE AND CO-LOCATION COMMITMENTS The Company has commitments for bandwidth usage and co-location with network service providers that expire at various dates through 2006. LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases its principal operating facilities under noncancelable operating leases. In March 2005, the Company renewed its existing lease for a term of 3 years. The renewal allows for a one-time lease buy-out at the end of March 2006 for a settlement amount of $40,000. As a result of the merger with Akamai Technologies, Inc., which was completed on June 10, 2005, the Company expects to terminate its lease arrangement at the end of March 2006. CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION The Company and Akamai were involved in lawsuits against each other regarding patent infringement and false advertising and trade secrets. Upon completion of the acquisition of Speedera by Akamai on June 10, 2005, all lawsuits between the parties were dismissed. In January 2004, another competitor filed suit in United States District Court in Delaware against the Company, alleging infringement of certain patents held by the competitor. The Company filed a counterclaim against the competitor alleging infringement of certain patents held by the Company. In February 2005, the Company reached a settlement agreement with the competitor. The settlement is payable on a quarterly basis, through February 2008. The settlement has been accrued as of March 31, 2005. INDEMNIFICATIONS FIN No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company's management believes the fair value of guarantees the Company issued or modified after December 31, 2002 were nominal. In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its services, the Company indemnifies other parties, including business partners, customers, lessors, preferred stock holders and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with an agent and an employee, and the Company's bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to the Company's officers and directors. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential exposure or amount under these indemnification
agreements due to the Company having no prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. However, the Company has an errors and omissions insurance policy that may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

EXHIBIT 99.5 AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. SPEEDERA NETWORKS, INC. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On June 10, 2005, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (the "Company" or "Akamai") acquired privately held Speedera Networks, Inc. ("Speedera"). The Company acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock, including vested and unvested stock options, of Speedera in exchange for approximately 10.6 million shares of Akamai common stock and 1.7 million Akamai stock options. The aggregate purchase price, net of cash received, was approximately $143.2 million, which consisted of $122.1 million in shares of common stock, $18.4 million in fair value of the Company's stock options and transaction costs of $2.7 million, which primarily consisted of fees for financial advisory and legal services. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and a final determination of required purchase accounting adjustment will be made upon the completion of the Company's evaluation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The unaudited combined condensed pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2005 is based on the individual balance sheets of Akamai and Speedera and prepared as if the acquisition of Speedera had occurred on March 31, 2005. The unaudited combined condensed pro forma statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the three months ended March 31, 2005, were prepared as if the acquisition of Speedera had occurred on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that Akamai believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be read in conjunction with Akamai's historical consolidated financial statements as previously filed on Akamai's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on March 16, 2005 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2005, filed with the Commission on May 10, 2005. In addition, this unaudited combined condensed pro forma information should be read in conjunction with the historical condensed consolidated financial statements of Speedera included within this Amendment to Current Report on Form 8-K/A. The historical income statement of Speedera for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 is based on combining the last six months of results of operation from Speedera's fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 with the first six months of results of operations from Speedera's fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. These unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial statements are prepared for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of future results or of actual results that would have been achieved had the acquisition of Speedera been consummated as of January 1, 2004 for the unaudited combined condensed pro forma statements of operations and as of March 31, 2005 for the unaudited combined condensed pro forma balance sheets. The pro forma financial statements do not give effect to any cost savings or incremental costs that may result from the integration of Akamai and Speedera.

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the three months ended March 31, 2005 give effect to the acquisition of Speedera by Akamai as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of March 31, 2005 gives effect to the above-mentioned acquisition as if it had occurred on March 31, 2005. The unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial information has been prepared on the same basis as Akamai's audited financial statements. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair value and consolidated into the net assets of Akamai. A summary of the preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition as if the purchase had occurred on March 31, 2005 is as follows (in thousands): Based upon the purchase price allocation, the total purchase price exceeded the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed when adjusted to fair market value and resulted in goodwill in the pro forma combined condensed financial information of approximately $92.8 million. The identified intangible assets acquired, including completed technologies, customer relationships and non-compete agreements were assigned fair values based upon an appraisal and totaled $43.2 million in aggregate. NOTE 2 - PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS Adjustments have been made to the unaudited pro forma combined financial information to reflect the following: (A) The elimination of the historic stockholders' deficit of Speedera. (B) The fixed assets were recorded at estimated fair market value of $2.8 million. (C) Record goodwill of $92.8 million for excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired less the liabilities assumed.
(D) Record the preliminary estimate of fair value for intangible assets determined at the time of acquisition of $43.2 million. The following are identified intangible assets acquired and the respective estimated useful lives over which the assets will be amortized: The completed technologies and the non-compete agreements will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. The customer relationships will be amortized at the ratio that current revenues generated from those customer relationships bear to the total estimated revenues to be generated from those relationships from the date of acquisition. Annual amortization expense from the customer relationships is expected to be $5.4 million for the remainder of 2005 and $6.6 million, $5.2 million, $4.5 million, $3.7 million and $3.1 million for each of the next five fiscal years, respectively. (E) Represents adjustment of deferred revenue to fair market value. (F) Reflects accruals for Akamai's direct costs of the acquisition of $1.4 million, $1.7 million of accrued restructuring liabilities consisting of employee severance and outplacement costs and $3.8 million of Speedera's transaction costs due at the acquisition date. (G) Record income taxes based on statutory rates applied to the net effect of changes in the results of operations. (H) Represents the amortization expense related to identified intangible assets acquired. (I) Represents elimination of Speedera's notes payable outstanding of $1.7 million and reduction in related interest expense during the pro forma periods presented that was repaid at the time of acquisition, which is directly attributable to the business combination. (J) Record depreciation expense for acquired fixed assets based on the estimate of fair values determined at the time of acquisition. Depreciation expense is calculated on straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 12 to 48 months. As a result of recording Speedera's fixed assets at estimated fair market value, the depreciation expense included in the pro forma adjustments column was reduced for the periods presented in the pro forma statements of operations. (K) Record deferred compensation of $9.7 million related to the intrinsic value allocated to the unvested options issued in the acquisition that had yet to be earned as of the acquisition date. (L) Record deferred compensation expense related to options issued in the acquisition which had been earned over the periods presented in the statement of operations included in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. (M) Record the issuance of 10.6 million shares of Akamai common stock of $122.1 million and $18.4 million in fair value of 1.7 million of exchanged stock options. (N) Reclassification of $1.2 million of Akamai transaction costs paid as of March 31, 2005 from other long-term assets to the total purchase consideration. (O) Record non-income tax expense, including property taxes and sales taxes, to conform with Akamai's policy on non-income tax reserves and accruals.
NOTE 3 - NET INCOME PER SHARE Pro forma basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable quarter and assumes that common shares for the business combination were issued at the beginning of the period presented. Pro forma diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the quarter, assuming the common shares for the business combination were issued at the beginning of the periods presented, plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock consists of stock options, deferred stock units, warrants, unvested restricted common stock and convertible notes. The following table sets forth the components used in the computation of pro forma basic and diluted net income per common share (in thousands, except per share data): For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's 1% convertible senior notes are antidilutive under the sequential calculation of diluted share count in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share."
