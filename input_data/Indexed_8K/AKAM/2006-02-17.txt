Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreement
     On February 15, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai" or the "Company") adopted cash and equity compensation programs for 2006 for the following executive officers: Paul Sagan, Melanie Haratunian, Robert Hughes, Chris Schoettle, J. Donald Sherman and Cathy Welsh (collectively, the "Executives").
     Each of the cash incentive components provides for an annual base salary and a cash bonus, the amount of such bonus to be determined based upon the achievement of certain pre-determined individual and corporate performance objectives. Specifically, each Executive's bonus is weighted as follows: 80% based on Akamai achievement of revenue and earnings per share targets for fiscal year 2006 and 20% based on achievement of individual or departmental performance goals. For Mr. Sagan, the target cash bonus is equal to 100% of his base salary, and the maximum cash bonus is equal to 200% of his base salary. For Ms. Haratunian, the target cash bonus is equal to 40% of her base salary, and the maximum cash bonus is equal to 80% of her base salary. For Mr. Hughes, the target cash bonus is equal to 100% of his base salary, and the maximum cash bonus is equal to 200% of his base salary. For Mr. Schoettle, the target cash bonus is equal to 67% of his base salary, and the maximum cash bonus is equal to 125% of his base salary. For Mr. Sherman, the target cash bonus is equal to 67% of his base salary, and the maximum cash bonus is equal to 125% of his base salary. For Ms. Welsh, the target cash bonus is equal to 40% of her base salary, and the maximum cash bonus is equal to 80% of her base salary.
     Each Executive was also granted stock options and restricted stock units as follows:
     The options have an exercise price of $25.77 per share, which is equal to the closing sale price of the Company's common stock on February 15, 2006, and vest in accordance with the following schedule: 25% vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining 75% vest in equal quarterly installments of 6.25% thereafter. Options are subject to the terms of the Company's standard form of incentive stock option agreement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Each Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") represents the right to receive one share of Akamai common stock upon vesting. Base RSUs vest in 33% installments on the first business day of each of 2007, 2008 and 2009. The terms of the base RSUs are more fully described in the form of restricted stock unit agreement attached hereto, and incorporated by reference herein, as Exhibit 99.1.
     Performance-Based RSUs will only vest to the extent that the Company exceeds specified cumulative revenue and earnings per share targets for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. The maximum number of performance-based RSUs that may vest is equal to 300% of the number of base RSUs granted on the same date; such maximum vesting would only occur if the Company meets or exceeds 110% of both its cumulative revenue and earnings per share targets for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. No performance-based RSUs will vest if the Company fails to exceed the applicable targets. If the Company's cumulative revenue and/or earnings per share results for the applicable years is between

100% and 110% of the targets, the holder would receive between zero RSUs and the maximum deliverable amount set forth above. The terms of the base RSUs are more fully described in the form of restricted stock unit agreement attached hereto, and incorporated by reference herein, as Exhibit 99.2.
     The foregoing descriptions of the RSU agreements are qualified in their entirety by the full text of Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively.

Withholding Taxes
          (a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer ("Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Unit award, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.

          (e) Participant understands and agrees that the number of Shares that the Broker will sell will be based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the last trading day before the applicable Vesting Date. The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Section 7.
          (f) Participant agrees that the proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to Section 7(d) will be used to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and, accordingly, Participant hereby authorizes the Broker to pay such proceeds to the Company for such purpose. Participant understands that to the extent that the proceeds obtained by such sale exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items, such excess proceeds shall be deposited into the Participants account with Broker. Participant further understands that any remaining Shares shall be deposited into such account.

     The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
     I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed), the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
     I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
     I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written. Electronic acceptance of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's instructions to Participant (including through an online acceptance process managed by the Company's agent) is acceptable.
 
     The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
     I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed), the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
     I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
     I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.
 
A.
Overview
     The RSUs shall vest only upon the Company's achievement of certain financial metrics based on target cumulative Revenue of $1,337.7 million and target cumulative Normalized EPS of $2.59 per share over the Company's fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Company's performance measured against each metric shall be equally weighted to enable comparison as a percentage of a combined target. For purposes of this Agreement, such metrics shall have the following meanings:
     "Revenue" shall mean the Company's cumulative annual revenue for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America as reported in the 2008 Financial Statements.
     "Normalized EPS" shall mean the Company's shall mean the Company's cumulative annual earnings per diluted share for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 excluding cumulative amortization of intangible assets, equity-related compensation, restructuring charges and benefits, certain gains and losses on equity investments, and loss on early extinguishment of debt.
     "Vesting Date" shall mean the 2008 Reporting Date or, if earlier, the date of a Change of Control Event.
B.
Calculation of Percentages
     The Company's Revenue shall be calculated as a percentage of the Company's target cumulative revenue for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 of $1,337.7 million and multiplied by 0.5 (the "Revenue Percentage Component"). The Company's Normalized EPS shall be calculated as a percentage of the Company's target cumulative normalized earnings per share, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, as reported in the 2008 Financial Statements for fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008 of $2.59 and multiplied by 0.5 (the "Normalized EPS Component"). The sum of the Revenue Percentage Component and the Normalized EPS Component shall be the "Actual Percentage of Targets."
C.
Vesting Amounts
     1. If the Actual Percentage of Targets fails to exceed 100%, then none of the RSUs shall vest and zero Shares shall be distributed in respect thereof.
     2. If the Actual Percentage of Targets equals 105%, then one-third of the Maximum RSU Bonus Award (the "Intermediate RSU Bonus Award") shall vest.
     3. If the Actual Percentage of Targets equals 110% or more, then the Maximum RSU Bonus Award shall vest.
     4. If the Actual Percentage of Targets is between 100% and 105%, then a number of RSUs equal to the product of the Intermediate RSU Bonus Award multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Actual Percentage of Targets Revenue minus 100% and the denominator is 5% shall vest.
     5. If the Actual Percentage of Targets is between 105% and 110%, then a number of RSUs equal to the following shall vest: the sum of (a) the Intermediate RSU Bonus Award plus (b) the product
 
of (i) the difference between the Maximum RSU Bonus Award and the Intermediate RSU Bonus Award multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the Actual Percentage of Targets Revenue minus 105% and the denominator is 5% shall vest.
D.
Effect of an Acquisition by the Company
     In the event that the Company enters into an Acquisition Transaction during 2006, then Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be adjusted to give effect to such Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" means (i) the purchase by the Company of more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, (ii) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or share exchange which results in the Company acquiring more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, or (iii) the purchase or other acquisition (including, without limitation, via license outside of the ordinary course of business or joint venture) of assets that constitute more than 50% of another entity's total assets or assets that account for more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues or net income of such entity.
     As soon as practicable following the closing of an Acquisition Transaction, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall make a determination of the estimated impact of the Acquisition Transaction on the Company's cumulative Revenue and Normalized EPS through 2008. If the Acquisition Transaction is estimated to be accretive, then:
     (i) in calculating Revenue for purposes of determining the Revenue Percentage Component, reported Revenue shall be reduced by the amount of estimated revenue contribution from the Acquisition Transaction; and
     (ii) in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2008 Financial Statements, shall be reduced by the amount of the estimated Normalized EPS contribution from the Acquisition Transaction.
If the Acquisition is estimated to be non-accretive, then:
     (iii) in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2008 Financial Statements, shall be increased by the amount of the estimated negative Normalized EPS impact from the Acquisition Transaction.
All determinations of the Compensation Committee regarding the estimated impact of an Acquisition Transaction shall be final, binding and non-appealable. This Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended, without further action by the Company or the Participant, to give effect to any adjustments required by this Section D.
E.
Effect of a Change in Control Event
     If there is a Change of Control Event, the RSUs shall vest as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event and Participant shall be entitled to receive a pro rated number of Shares based on the amount of time elapsed between the Grant Date and December 31, 2008. The number of Shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs, if any, shall be calculated based on a pro forma Actual Percentage of Targets calculated as follows:
     (i) If the Change of Control Event occurs in 2006, Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be calculated based on the Company's Revenue and Normalized EPS results during the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the most recently reported fiscal quarter prior to the closing date of the Change
 
of Control Event. Such numbers shall then be multiplied by three for purposes of calculating the Actual Percentage of Targets.
     (ii) If the Change of Control Event occurs in 2007, Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be calculated based on the Company's Revenue and Normalized EPS results for fiscal year 2006. Such numbers shall then be multiplied by three for purposes of calculating the Actual Percentage of Targets.
     (iii) If the Change of Control Event occurs in 2008, Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be calculated based on the cumulative Revenue and Normalized EPS results for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 plus an amount equal to the Revenue and Normalized EPS for 2008 that would result if the rate of growth (loss) for Revenue and Normalized EPS, respectively, between 2006 and 2007 were to continue for 2008. Such sums shall be used for calculating the Actual Percentage of Targets.
Once the pro forma Actual Percentage of Targets has been determined and the number of Shares, if any, that would have been issuable in respect of the RSUs on the 2008 Reporting Date (the "Pro Forma Distribution Amount") calculated, the actual number of Shares issuable shall be adjusted proportionally based on the percentage of the three-year calculation period that has elapsed as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event (e.g., if the closing date of the Change in Control Event were April 1, 2007, the number of Shares issuable would be 41.7% (15 months/36 months) of the total Pro Forma Distribution Amount).
