EXHIBIT 99.1
  Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the leading global service provider for accelerating content and business processes online, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006. Revenue for first quarter 2006 was $90.8 million, a 10 percent increase over fourth quarter 2005 revenue of $82.7 million, and a 51 percent increase over first quarter 2005 revenue of $60.1 million.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
April 26, 2006
Net income in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, for the first quarter of 2006 was $11.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. GAAP net income in the first quarter includes equity-related compensation charges of approximately $7.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 123R on January 1, 2006. GAAP net income also reflects a book tax rate of approximately 45 percent.
The Company generated normalized net income* of $29.4 million, or $0.17 per normalized diluted share*, in the first quarter of 2006, a 12 percent increase over fourth quarter 2005 normalized net income of $26.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, and a 105 percent improvement over 2005 first quarter normalized earnings of $14.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. (*See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitions.)
"We had a very strong quarter, delivering higher than expected revenue growth," said Paul Sagan, president and CEO of Akamai. "We benefited from strong demand for our core content delivery services as more and more enterprises continue to move critical business processes online, especially in the area of digital media and entertainment content."
 
Adjusted EBITDA* for the first quarter of 2006 was $33.4 million, up 9 percent from $30.6 million in the prior quarter, and up from $20.4 million in the first quarter of 2005. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 37 percent, consistent with the prior quarter and up from 34 percent a year ago. (*See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitions.)
Cash from operations was $33.2 million in the first quarter, as compared to $27.7 million in the fourth quarter 2005 and $18.7 million in the same period last year.
At March 31, 2006, the Company had approximately 154 million shares of common stock outstanding.
Customers
The number of customers under long-term services contracts at the end of the first quarter increased by 71 to a record 1,981, a 4 percent increase over fourth quarter 2005, and a 46 percent increase year-over-year.
Sales through resellers and sales outside the United States each accounted for 23 percent of revenue for the first quarter of 2006.

* Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Akamai has historically provided additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP). Recent legislative and regulatory changes discourage the use of and emphasis on non-GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We believe that the non-GAAP financial metrics we have included are helpful to management and investors because they provide additional insight into our operations. Set forth below are definitions of the non-GAAP terms we use and explanations of some of the benefits provided by those metrics.
 
Akamai defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets, equity-related compensation, depreciation of capitalized equity-related compensation, certain gains and losses on equity investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, utilization of tax NOL carryforward and release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of the Company's core operations, such as investment gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and net interest expense, or do not require a cash outlay, such as equity-related compensation and impairment of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which is based on the Company's estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historic cost incurred to build out the Company's deployed network, and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures. Because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates these items, Akamai considers this financial measure to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a good measure of the Company's historical operating trend.
Akamai defines "Adjusted EBITDA margin" as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA over revenue. Akamai considers Adjusted EBITDA margin to be an indicator of the Company's operating trend and performance of its business in relation to its revenue growth.
Akamai defines "capital expenditures" or "capex" as purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software development costs. Capital expenditures or capex are disclosed in Akamai's condensed consolidated statement of cash flows in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Akamai defines "normalized diluted share" as diluted common shares outstanding used in the GAAP net income per share calculation, excluding the effect of FAS 123R under the treasury stock method. Akamai considers normalized diluted shares to be another important indicator of overall performance of the Company because it eliminates the effect of a non-cash item.
Akamai defines "normalized net income" as net income before amortization of intangible assets, equity-related compensation, depreciation of capitalized equity-related compensation, certain gains and losses on equity investments, utilization of tax NOL carryforward and release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Akamai considers normalized net income to be another important indicator of the overall performance of the Company because it eliminates the effects of events that are either not part of the Company's core operations or are non-cash.
Adjusted EBITDA and normalized net income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's operating income and net income, as well as other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is presenting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and reconciling the non-GAAP financial metrics to the comparable GAAP measures.
