On May 19, 2009, the shareholders of Akamai Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan"), which was previously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on March 16, 2009. 8,500,000 shares are available for grant under the 2009 Plan. Awards outstanding under the Company's Second Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Existing Plans") as of May 19, 2009 that subsequently expire or are terminated, surrendered, cancelled or forfeited will also become available for grant under the 2009 Plan. The Company will no longer grant awards under the Existing Plans.
The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, other stock-based awards and cash awards, including awards subject to specified performance criteria designed to qualify for deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code.
Employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted awards under the 2009 Plan. Under present law, however, incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. The 2009 Plan is administered by the Company's Board of Directors. Under the terms of the 2009 Plan, the Board of Directors may delegate authority under the 2009 Plan to one or more committees or subcommittees of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has authorized the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") to administer certain aspects of the 2009 Plan, including the granting of awards to executive officers. In addition, as permitted by the terms of the 2009 Plan, the Board of Directors has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company the authority to grant equity awards to non-executive employees in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee.
The Board of Directors or the Committee may modify awards granted to participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States or establish sub plans or procedures under the 2009 Plan to recognize differences in laws, rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters.
The foregoing description of the 2009 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2009 Plan, which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-8 (No. 333-159340) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 19, 2009.
In connection with the adoption of the 2009 Plan, the Committee also approved new form agreements for awards to be granted under the 2009 Plan. These forms are substantially similar to the forms used for grants of awards under the Company's 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the equity plan generally used for grant of awards by the Company prior to the approval of the 2009 Plan and consist of:
 
 
 
These forms are filed as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.6 hereto.
 
(d) Exhibits
See Exhibit Index attached hereto which is incorporated herein by reference.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Unless earlier terminated, this option shall expire on the seventh anniversary of the Grant Date (the "Final Exercise Date").

Exhibit 10.3
 
This Agreement evidences the grant by Akamai Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") on                     ,              (the "Grant Date") to you (the "Participant") of              restricted stock units of the Company (individually, an "RSU" and collectively, the "RSUs"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the "Agreement") and the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") as provided in this Agreement. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon vesting of the RSUs are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified in the Plan.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that the Participant continues to provide services until the Vesting Date (as defined below):
(a) This award shall vest as to 33% of the original number of RSUs on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and as to an additional 8.375% of the original number of RSUs at the end of each successive full three-month period thereafter; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing dates is not a business day, then vesting shall occur on the next succeeding business day. The date on which RSUs vest may be referred to herein as the "Vesting Date."
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, RSUs shall not continue to vest unless the Participant is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company.
(c) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company ceases or is terminated for any reason, including by reason of death or disability, other than "Cause" (as defined below), then the number of RSUs which shall be vested shall be the number that are vested as of the date of actual termination. For purposes of this Section 2, "Cause" shall mean unsatisfactory job performance (as determined by the Company), willful misconduct, fraud, gross negligence, disobedience or dishonesty. In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for Cause, all unvested RSUs shall be forfeited effective as of the date of termination.
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with a parent, subsidiary, affiliate or division of the Company.
 
(a) The Company will distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's estate in the event that his or her death occurs after a Vesting Date but before distribution of the corresponding Shares), the Shares of Common Stock represented by RSUs that vested on such vesting date as soon as
administratively practicable after each vesting date (each such date of distribution is hereinafter referred to as a "Settlement Date") but in any event within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and one-half months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable Vesting Date or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable Vesting Date.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue to the Participant the Shares upon the vesting of any RSU (or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal or state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
(c) Neither the Company nor the Participant shall have the right to accelerate or defer the deliver of any shares under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively "transfer") any RSUs, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
Except as set forth in the Plan, neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Shares issuable pursuant to the RSUs granted hereunder until the Shares have been delivered to the Participant.
 
(a) This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is made available to the Participant with this Agreement.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Acquisition Event (as defined in the Plan) that is not a Change in Control Event (as defined in the Plan), each RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Acquisition Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Common Stock subject to such RSU.
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (regardless of whether such event also constitutes an Acquisition Event), each RSU shall become exercisable, realizable or vested as to number of RSUs as would be vested pursuant to Section 2(a) as though the Grant Date were the date that is one year prior to the Grant Date.
 
(a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer ("Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Unit award, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
(b) In the event that the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division is required to withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the award or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, or the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division to satisfy all withholding and payment on account obligations of the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including the delivery of shares upon vesting, shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 7. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant from his or her wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may withhold in shares of Common Stock an amount of shares sufficient to cover the Participant's tax liability.
(c) The Participant will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan or the Participant's award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
(d) As a condition to receiving any Shares, on the date of this Agreement, Participant must execute the Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares attached hereto, which authorizes the Company and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (or such substitute brokerage firm as is contracted to manage the Company's employee equity award program, the "Broker") to take the actions described in Section 7(b) and this Section 7(d) (the "Standing Order").
(e) Participant understands and agrees that the number of Shares that the Broker will sell will be based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the last trading day before the applicable Vesting Date. The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Section 7.
(f) Participant agrees that the proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to Section 7(d) will be used to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and, accordingly, Participant hereby authorizes the Broker to pay such proceeds to the Company for such purpose. Participant understands that to the extent that the proceeds obtained by such sale exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items, such excess proceeds shall be deposited into the Participants account with Broker. Participant further understands that any remaining Shares shall be deposited into such account.
(g) The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock. The Participant and the Company have structured this Agreement to constitute a "binding contract" relating to the sale of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 7, consistent with the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act.
 
(a) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or purchasing shares hereunder). The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the vesting period, for any period, or at all.
No Rights to Employment
 
(b) . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
Severability
(c) . Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board of Directors of the Company.
Waiver
(d) . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement.
Binding Effect
(e) . All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery or five days after deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party hereto at the address shown beneath his or its respective signature to this Agreement, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 8(e).
Notice
(f) . Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.
Pronouns
(g) . This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. In the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, or any matters as to which this Agreement is silent, the Plan shall govern including, without limitation, the provisions thereof pursuant to which the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has the power, among other things, to (i) interpret the Plan, (ii) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan and (iii) make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
Entire Agreement; Conflicts and Interpretation
(h) . The Company may modify, amend or waive the terms of this Agreement prospectively or retroactively, but no such modification, amendment or waiver shall impair the rights of the Participant without his or her consent, except as required by applicable law, NASDAQ or stock exchange rules, tax rules or accounting rules. Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of the Company. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement.
Amendment
(i) . This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws.
Governing Law
(j) . The right of the Participant to receive Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. The Participant shall have no rights under this Agreement other than those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
Unfunded Rights
(k) . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to the RSUs awarded under and participation in the Plan or future options that may
Electronic Delivery
 
be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or to request the Participant's consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written. Electronic acceptance of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's instructions to Participant (including through an online acceptance process managed by the Company's agent) is acceptable.
 
 
The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed), the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.
 
 

Exhibit 10.4
 
This Agreement evidences the grant by Akamai Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), on January 29, 2008 (the "Grant Date") to you (the "Participant") of              restricted stock units of the Company (individually, an "RSU" and collectively, the "RSUs"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") as provided in this Agreement. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon vesting of the RSUs are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified in the Plan.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that the Participant continues to provide services until the Vesting Date (as defined below):
(a) This award shall vest:
(i) as to one-third of the original number of RSUs on the second business day following the date on which the Company releases its earnings results for 2009 in the event that the Company achieved the following revenue and normalized earnings per share ("Normalized EPS") metrics during 2009:
 
(ii) as to one-third of the original number of RSUs on the second business day following the date on which the Company releases its earnings results for 2010 in the event that the Company achieved the revenue and Normalized EPS metrics for 2010 established by the Board (or a committee thereof) in early 2010.
(iii) as to one-third of the original number of RSUs on the second business day following the date on which the Company releases its earnings results for 2011 in the event that the Company achieved the revenue and Normalized EPS metrics for 2011 established by the Board (or a committee thereof) in early 2011.
"Normalized EPS" shall mean shall mean the Company's annual earnings per diluted share for the applicable fiscal year excluding amortization of intangible assets, equity-related compensation, restructuring charges and benefits, certain gains and losses on equity investments, loss on early extinguishment of debt, utilization of tax NOLs/credits, release of deferred tax assets and similar items excluded by the Company in determining normalized earnings per share in issuing its earnings announcement for such fiscal year.
Each of the dates on which RSUs vest may be referred to herein as a "Vesting Date." If the Company does not meet the applicable revenue and Normalized EPS metrics during a fiscal year, the 33% of RSUs eligible for vesting in connection therewith shall be forfeited.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, RSUs shall not continue to vest unless the Participant is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company.
(c) In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company ceases or is terminated for any reason, including by reason of death or disability, other than "Cause" (as defined below), then the number of RSUs which shall be vested shall be the number that are vested as of the date of actual termination. For purposes of this Section 2, "Cause" shall mean unsatisfactory job performance (as determined by the Company), willful misconduct, fraud, gross negligence, disobedience or dishonesty. In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for Cause, all unvested RSUs shall be forfeited effective as of the date of termination.
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with a parent, subsidiary, affiliate or division of the Company.
 
(a) The Company will distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's estate in the event that his or her death occurs after a Vesting Date but before distribution of the corresponding Shares), the Shares of Common Stock represented by RSUs that vest on each Vesting Date as soon as administratively practicable after such Vesting Date (each such date of distribution is hereinafter referred to as a "Settlement Date") but in any event within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and one-half months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable Vesting Date or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable Vesting Date.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue to the Participant the Shares upon the vesting of any RSU (or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal or state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
(c) Neither the Company nor the Participant shall have the right to accelerate or defer the deliver of any shares under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively "transfer") any RSUs, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
Except as set forth in the Plan, neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Shares issuable pursuant to the RSUs granted hereunder until the Shares have been delivered to the Participant.
 
(a) This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is made available to the Participant with this Agreement.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Acquisition Event (as defined in the Plan) that is not a Change in Control Event (as defined in the Plan), each RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Acquisition Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Common Stock subject to such RSU.
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (regardless of whether such event also constitutes an Acquisition Event), each RSU shall become exercisable, realizable or vested as to such number of RSUs as would be vested pursuant to Section 2(a) as though the Grant Date were the date that is one year prior to the Grant Date and all performance targets on which vesting in contingent have been achieved.
 
(a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer ("Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Unit award, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) In the event that the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division is required to withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the award or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, or the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division to satisfy all withholding and payment on account obligations of the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including the delivery of shares upon vesting, shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 7. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant from his or her wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may withhold in shares of Common Stock an amount of shares sufficient to cover the Participant's tax liability.
(c) The Participant will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan or the Participant's award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
(d) As a condition to receiving any Shares, on the date of this Agreement, Participant must execute the Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares attached hereto, which authorizes the Company and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (or such substitute brokerage firm as is contracted to manage the Company's employee equity award program, the "Broker") to take the actions described in Section 7(b) and this Section 7(d) (the "Standing Order").
 
(e) Participant understands and agrees that the number of Shares that the Broker will sell will be based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the last trading day before the applicable Vesting Date. The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Section 7.
(f) Participant agrees that the proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to Section 7(d) will be used to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and, accordingly, Participant hereby authorizes the Broker to pay such proceeds to the Company for such purpose. Participant understands that to the extent that the proceeds obtained by such sale exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items, such excess proceeds shall be deposited into the Participants account with Broker. Participant further understands that any remaining Shares shall be deposited into such account.
(g) The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock. The Participant and the Company have structured this Agreement to constitute a "binding contract" relating to the sale of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 7, consistent with the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act.

Electronic Delivery

The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed), the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.

The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed) or as soon as practicable thereafter, the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.
 
 
 
The RSUs shall vest only upon the Company's achievement of certain financial metrics based on target cumulative Revenue of $             million and target cumulative Normalized EPS of $             per share over the Company's fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. The Company's performance measured against each metric shall be equally weighted to enable comparison as a percentage of a combined target. For purposes of this Agreement, such metrics shall have the following meanings:
"Revenue" shall mean the Company's cumulative annual revenue for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America as reported in the 2011 Financial Statements.
"Normalized EPS" shall mean the Company's shall mean the Company's cumulative annual earnings per diluted share for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 excluding cumulative amortization of intangible assets, equity-related compensation, restructuring charges and benefits, certain gains and losses on equity investments, non-cash income taxes and loss on early extinguishment of debt.
"Vesting Amount" shall mean the aggregate amount, if any, issuable to the Participant based on the Company's Revenue and Normalized EPS performance measured against the Actual Percentage of Targets defined below.
 
The Company's Revenue shall be calculated as a percentage of the Company's target cumulative revenue for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 of $             million and multiplied by 0.5 (the "Revenue Percentage Component"). The Company's Normalized EPS shall be calculated as a percentage of the Company's target cumulative normalized earnings per share, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, as reported in the 2011 Financial Statements for fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 of $             and multiplied by 0.5 (the "Normalized EPS Component"). The sum of the Revenue Percentage Component and the Normalized EPS Component shall be the "Actual Percentage of Targets."
 
1. If the Actual Percentage of Targets fails to exceed 100%, then none of the RSUs shall vest and zero Shares shall be distributed in respect thereof.
2. If the Actual Percentage of Targets equals 103.4%, then the Vesting Amount shall equal one-half of the Maximum RSU Bonus Award, as defined in Paragraph 1 of the Agreement (the "Intermediate RSU Bonus Award"), and shall vest.
3. If the Actual Percentage of Targets equals 106.9% or more, then the Vesting Amount shall equal the Maximum RSU Bonus Award, as defined in Paragraph 1 of the Agreement, and shall vest.
4. If the Actual Percentage of Targets is between 100% and 103.4%, then the Vesting Amount shall equal a number of RSUs equal to the product of the Intermediate RSU Bonus Award multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the Actual Percentage of Targets Revenue minus 100% and the denominator is 3.4% and shall vest.
 
5. If the Actual Percentage of Targets is between 103.4% and 106.9%, then the Vesting Amount shall equal the sum of (a) the Intermediate RSU Bonus Award plus (b) the product of (i) the difference between the Maximum RSU Bonus Award and the Intermediate RSU Bonus Award multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the Actual Percentage of Targets Revenue minus 103.4% and the denominator is 3.5%, and shall vest.
 
In the event that the Company enters into an Acquisition Transaction during 2009, then Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be adjusted to give effect to such Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" means (i) the purchase by the Company of more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, (ii) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or share exchange which results in the Company acquiring more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, or (iii) the purchase or other acquisition (including, without limitation, via license outside of the ordinary course of business or joint venture) of assets that constitute more than 50% of another entity's total assets or assets that account for more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues or net income of such entity.
As soon as practicable following the closing of an Acquisition Transaction, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall make a determination of the estimated impact of the Acquisition Transaction on the Company's cumulative Revenue and Normalized EPS through 2011. If the Acquisition Transaction is estimated to be accretive, then:
(i) in calculating Revenue for purposes of determining the Revenue Percentage Component, reported Revenue shall be reduced by the amount of estimated revenue contribution from the Acquisition Transaction; and
(ii) in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2011 Financial Statements, shall be reduced by the amount of the estimated Normalized EPS contribution from the Acquisition Transaction.
If the Acquisition is estimated to be non-accretive, then:
(iii) in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2011 Financial Statements, shall be increased by the amount of the estimated negative Normalized EPS impact from the Acquisition Transaction.
All determinations of the Compensation Committee regarding the estimated impact of an Acquisition Transaction shall be final, binding and non-appealable. This Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended, without further action by the Company or the Participant, to give effect to any adjustments required by this Section D.
 
(1) If there is a Change of Control Event prior to December 31, 2011, the RSUs shall vest as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event and Participant shall be entitled to receive a pro rated number of Shares based on the amount of time elapsed between the Grant Date and December 31, 2011. The number of Shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs, if any, shall be calculated based on a pro forma Actual Percentage of Targets calculated as follows:
(i) If the Change of Control Event occurs in 2009, Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be calculated based on the Company's Revenue and Normalized EPS results during the twelve-month period ending on the last day of the most recently reported fiscal quarter prior to the closing date of the Change of Control Event. Such numbers shall then be multiplied by three for purposes of calculating the Actual Percentage of Targets.
 
(ii) If the Change of Control Event occurs in 2010, Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be calculated based on the Company's Revenue and Normalized EPS results for fiscal year 2009. Such numbers shall then be multiplied by three for purposes of calculating the Actual Percentage of Targets.
(iii) If the Change of Control Event occurs in 2011, Revenue and Normalized EPS shall be calculated based on the cumulative Revenue and Normalized EPS results for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 plus an amount equal to the Revenue and Normalized EPS for 2011 that would result if the rate of growth (loss) for Revenue and Normalized EPS, respectively, between 2009 and 2010 were to continue for 2011. Such sums shall be used for calculating the Actual Percentage of Targets.
Once the pro forma Actual Percentage of Targets has been determined and the number of Shares, if any, that would have been issuable in respect of the RSUs on the 2011 Reporting Date (the "Pro Forma Distribution Amount") calculated, the actual number of Shares issuable shall be adjusted proportionally based on the percentage of the three-year calculation period that has elapsed as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event (e.g., if the closing date of the Change in Control Event were April 1, 2010, the number of Shares issuable would be 41.7% (15 months/36 months) of the total Pro Forma Distribution Amount).
(2) If (i) there is a Change of Control Event between January 1, 2012 and September 30, 2012; (ii) Participant meets the requirements of Paragraph 2(c) of this Agreement as of immediately prior to the Change of Control Event and (iii) Participant's employment is terminated by the surviving entity in the Change of Control transaction at any time during the period between the Change of Control Event and October 1, 2012 for any reason other than for Cause (as defined below), then the entire portion of the Vesting Amount that had not vested prior to Participation's termination shall vest in full as of the effective date of Participant's termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (a) any act or omission by Participant that has an adverse effect on Akamai's business or on the employee's ability to perform services for Akamai, including, without limitation, the commission of any crime (other than ordinary traffic violations), or (b) refusal or failure to perform assigned duties, serious misconduct, or excessive absenteeism. Whether a Participant has been terminated for "Cause" shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Company's management or, in the case of an executive officer, the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.
 

Exhibit 10.6
This DEFERRED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of             ,          (the "Grant Date"), between Akamai Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and                      (the "Grantee").
For valuable consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
The Company hereby grants to Grantee, and Grantee hereby accepts from the Company, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"),              deferred stock units of the Company (the "DSUs"). Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon vesting of the DSUs are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." Subject to the provisions of Section 2(b) hereof, this award of DSUs is irrevocable and is intended to conform in all respects with the Plan.
1. .
Grant of Award
2. .
Vesting
(a) . Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Section 2, the DSUs will vest as follows: 50% shall vest on first anniversary of the Grant Date, and the remaining 50% shall vest in equal installments of 12.5% on a quarterly basis thereafter.
Regular Vesting
(b) . Vesting in any of the DSUs pursuant to subsection (a) above is contingent upon the continuation of Grantee's service as a Director of the Company. In the event that Grantee ceases to be a Director of the Company for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to Grantee's voluntary resignation, death, or failure to be nominated for election, or to be elected, as a Director, all vesting shall cease as of the date of Grantee's cessation of service as a Director. Unvested DSUs will be immediately forfeited as of such date and neither Grantee nor its estate will have any further rights to such unvested DSUs or the Shares represented by those forfeited DSUs.
Forfeiture
(c) . Upon a Change in Control Event (as defined in the Plan), the number of DSUs which are considered vested shall be calculated pursuant to Section 2(a) as though the Grant Date were the date that is one year prior to the actual Grant Date.
Change of Control
3. .
Distribution of Shares
(a) . Unless Grantee has made a proper deferral election pursuant to Section 3(b) below, the Company will distribute to Grantee (or to Grantee's estate in the event that his or her death occurs after a vesting date but before distribution of the corresponding Shares), within thirty (30) days after each vesting date, the Shares of Common Stock represented by DSUs that vested on such vesting date. If Grantee has elected to defer receipt of only a portion of the Shares distributable on a vesting date pursuant to Section 3(b) below, within thirty (30) days after such vesting date, the Company will distribute to Grantee the Shares of Common Stock represented by DSUs that vested on such vesting date and as to which distribution was not deferred. No fractional Shares will be issued.
Distribution Upon Vesting
 
(b) . Notwithstanding the distribution dates specified in Section 3(a) above, if the Grantee has previously elected, by providing written notice to the Vice President of Human Resources of the Company on or before December 31 of the year preceding the date of this Agreement to defer receipt of all or a portion of the Shares represented by the DSUs scheduled to vest on such vesting date until a date (the "Deferred Distribution Date") that is at least one year following the scheduled vesting date but not more than ten (10) years following the Grant Date. If Grantee elects to defer receipt of all or a portion of the Shares, Grantee must also specify how Grantee wishes the Shares to be distributed in the event of a Change in Control of the Company (i.e., whether Shares are to be distributed upon the effectiveness of the Change in Control or whether the Shares or rights attendant thereto are to be received in accordance with the deferral election). Each election made pursuant to their Section 3(b) shall be irrevocable and not subject to further deferral.
Deferral of Distributions
(c) . The Company shall not be obligated to issue to Grantee the Shares upon the vesting of any DSU or on any Deferred Distribution Date (or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal or state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
Compliance with Law
(d) . Neither the Company nor the Participant shall have the right to accelerate or defer the deliver of any shares under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
General Rule of Deferrals and Accelerations
This Agreement may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered by Grantee in any manner whatsoever, except that it may be transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution. References to Grantee, to the extent relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Grantee shall not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise, any DSUs (each, a "transfer"). Any such transfer by Grantee in violation of this Section 4 shall be void and of no force or effect, and shall result in the immediate forfeiture of all DSUs.
4. .
Restrictions on Transfer
5. .
Dividend and Other Shareholder Rights
(a) . If at any time during the period between the date that any deferred DSU vests and the Deferred Distribution Date for Shares represented by that deferred DSU (a "Deferral Period"), the Company pays a dividend on its Common Stock, then on each such dividend payment date (each, a "Dividend Payment Date"), Grantee will automatically receive an additional number of DSUs DSUs that have a value equal to the dollar value of the dividend payment based on the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of the Shares distributable in respect of such deferred DSUs on the Dividend Payment Date. Any such additional DSUs issued under this Section 5(a) shall be considered DSUs under this Agreement and shall also be credited with additional DSUs as dividends, if any, are declared. Shares represented by DSUs issued as dividends will be distributed on the same date as Shares distributable in respect of the underlying DSUs.
Dividends
(b) . Except as set forth in Section 5(a) above and in the Plan, neither Grantee nor any person claiming under or through Grantee shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Shares issuable pursuant to the DSUs granted hereunder until the Shares have been delivered to Grantee.
Other Shareholder Rights
 
The Company's obligation to deliver Shares to Grantee upon the vesting of DSUs shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements ("Withholding Taxes"). The Company may take such steps as it deems necessary or desirable for satisfaction of Withholding Taxes obligations.
6. .
Withholding of Taxes
All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery, deposit with a nationally recognized courier service, or five days after deposit in the United States Post Office, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party hereto at the address shown beneath his, her or its respective signature to this Agreement, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 7.

8. .
Governing Law
This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to Grantee with this Agreement.

No Right to Status as a Director
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and Grantee and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement.
11. .

12. .
Severability
This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Company and Grantee. Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board.
