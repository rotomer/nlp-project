On February 3, 2010, Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai" or the "Registrant") announced its preliminary financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009. Set forth below is a revised balance sheet dated December 31, 2009 that corrects two errors in the unaudited balance sheet dated December 31, 2009 (the "original balance sheet") that was included in the press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Registrant's Current Report on Form 8-K dated February 3, 2010.
Under the terms of Akamai's 1% senior convertible subordinated notes due 2033 (the "convertible notes"), holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require the repayment of some or all of the principal amount of such convertible notes on specified dates beginning in December 2010. The indebtedness associated with such convertible notes was erroneously classified as a long-term liability in the original balance sheet. Accordingly, Akamai has reclassified the indebtedness associated with such convertible notes as a current liability in the balance sheet set forth below. See Note 12 to the financial statements included in the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 for a more complete discussion of the terms of the convertible notes. In addition, a $9.9 million non-cash deferred tax item was erroneously recorded in the original balance sheet as an increase, rather than a decrease, in each of Deferred Income Tax Assets and Stockholders' Equity. To reflect the correction of such item, the Deferred Income Tax Assets and Stockholders' Equity have each been reduced by $19.8 million in the balance sheet set forth below.
None of the changes to the original balance sheet require any adjustments to the Registrant's Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2009, or Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet dated December 31, 2008 included in the original press release.
Akamai expects to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K, including its audited consolidated financial statements, on or about March 1, 2010.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
