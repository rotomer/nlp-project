Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the leading provider of cloud optimization services, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011. Revenue for second quarter 2011 was $277.0 million, a 13 percent increase over second quarter 2010 revenue of $245.3 million, and slightly above first quarter 2011 revenue of $276.0 million.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  July 27, 2011 
Net income in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, for the second quarter of 2011 was $47.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, a 26 percent increase from second quarter 2010 GAAP net income of $38.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and a 5 percent decrease from first quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $50.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share.
The Company generated normalized net income* of $65.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011, a 1 percent improvement over second quarter 2010 normalized net income of $65.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, and down 9 percent from first quarter 2011 normalized net income of $72.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. (*See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitions.)
Included in these results for the second quarter of 2011 is a tax charge of $28.3 million, based on a full-year GAAP tax rate of 35 percent. This tax rate is higher than the previous forecast of 32 to 33 percent, due to increased costs attributable to investment in the Company's network outside of North America. The impact of the higher tax rate on net income in the second quarter of 2011 was approximately $5.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.
"Trends in cloud computing, Internet security, mobile connectivity, and the proliferation of online video have continued to drive our customers' online initiatives and our business success," said Paul Sagan, CEO of Akamai. "With the scale, data and software underlying the Akamai intelligent platform, combined with our deep industry expertise, we believe Akamai is uniquely capable of enabling our customers' online businesses to grow revenues and reduce costs. We continue to position Akamai to lead the next evolution of cloud computing by investing in the business to build new and innovative solutions that leverage the Company's core competencies."
Adjusted EBITDA* for the second quarter of 2011 was $126.2 million, up 13 percent from $112.1 million in the second quarter of 2010 and down about 2 percent from $129.2 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin* for the second quarter of 2011 was 46 percent, consistent with the same period last year. (*See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for definitions.)
Cash from operations was $111.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 or 40 percent of revenue. At the end of the second quarter of 2011, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Sales through resellers and sales outside the United States accounted for 19 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of revenue for the second quarter 2011.
During the second quarter of 2011, under a share repurchase program that was approved by the Board of Directors in April 2009 and extended in April 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock for $50.5 million at an average price of $32.90 per share. As of June 30, 2011, the Company had repurchased 8.3 million shares of common stock for $251.5 million at an average price of $30.15 per share.
As of June 30, 2011, the Company had approximately 186.0 million shares of common stock outstanding.

Financial Statements
 
 
 
 
*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Akamai has historically provided additional financial metrics that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP). Legislative and regulatory changes discourage the use of and emphasis on non-GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors. These measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. There are limitations associated with reliance on these non-GAAP financial metrics because they are specific to our operations and financial performance, which may make comparisons with other companies' financial results more challenging. By providing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, we believe that investors are able to compare our GAAP results to those of other companies while also gaining a better understanding of our operating performance as evaluated by management.
Akamai defines "Adjusted EBITDA" as net income, before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and benefits, acquisition related costs and benefits, certain gains and losses on investments, foreign exchange gains and losses, loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains on legal settlements. Akamai considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a good measure of the Company's historical operating trend.
Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of the Company's core operations, such as investment gains and losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, early debt extinguishment and net interest income, or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization expense, which is based on the Company's estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on the historical cost incurred to build out the Company's deployed network, and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures.
Akamai defines "Adjusted EBITDA margin" as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. Akamai considers Adjusted EBITDA margin to be an indicator of the Company's operating trend and performance of its business in relation to its revenue growth.
Akamai defines "capital expenditures" or "capex" as purchases of property and equipment, capitalization of internal-use software development costs and capitalization of stock-based compensation. Capital expenditures or capex are disclosed in Akamai's consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Akamai defines "normalized net income" as net income before amortization of other intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and benefits, acquisition related costs and benefits, certain gains and losses on investments and loss on early extinguishment of debt. Akamai considers normalized net income to be another important indicator of the overall performance of the Company because it eliminates the effects of events that are either not part of the Company's core operations or are non-cash.
Akamai defines "normalized net income per share" as normalized net income, plus interest add-back for diluted share calculation, divided by the basic weighted average or diluted common shares outstanding used in GAAP net income per share calculations. Akamai considers normalized net income per share to be another important indicator of overall performance of the Company because it eliminates the effect of a non-cash item.
Adjusted EBITDA and normalized net income should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the Company's operating income and net income, as well as other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is presenting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and reconciling the non-GAAP financial metrics to the comparable GAAP measures.
