See Exhibit Index attached hereto which is incorporated herein by reference.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
This Agreement evidences the grant by Akamai Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") on                     ,          (the "Grant Date") to you (the "Participant") of              restricted stock units of the Company (individually, an "RSU" and collectively, the "RSUs"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the "Agreement") and the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") as provided in this Agreement. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon vesting of the RSUs are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified in the Plan.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that the Participant continues to provide services until the Vesting Date (as defined below):
(a) This award shall vest as                                         ; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing dates is not a business day, then vesting shall occur on the next succeeding business day. The date on which RSUs vest may be referred to herein as the "Vesting Date."
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, RSUs shall not continue to vest unless the Participant is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company.
(c) Except as reflected in Section 6 below, in the event that the Participant's employment with the Company ceases or is terminated for any reason other than "Cause" (as defined below), other than by reason of death or disability, then the number of RSUs which shall be vested shall be the number that are vested as of the date of actual termination. For purposes of this Section 2, "Cause" shall mean unsatisfactory job performance (as determined by the Company), willful misconduct, fraud, gross negligence, disobedience or dishonesty. In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company is terminated for Cause, all unvested RSUs shall be forfeited effective as of the date of termination. In the event that the Participant's employment with the Company ceases due to death or disability (as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), then all unvested RSUs shall vest as of the date of death or disability.
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with a parent, subsidiary, affiliate or division of the Company.
 
(a) The Company will distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's estate in the event that his or her death occurs after a Vesting Date but before distribution of the corresponding Shares), the Shares of Common Stock represented by RSUs that vested on such vesting date as soon as
administratively practicable after each vesting date (each such date of distribution is hereinafter referred to as a "Settlement Date") but in any event within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is two and one-half months from the end of (i) Participant's tax year that includes the applicable Vesting Date or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the applicable Vesting Date.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue to the Participant the Shares upon the vesting of any RSU (or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal or state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
(c) Neither the Company nor the Participant shall have the right to accelerate or defer the deliver of any shares under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted under the Code.
 
The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively "transfer") any RSUs, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
Except as set forth in the Plan, neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Shares issuable pursuant to the RSUs granted hereunder until the Shares have been delivered to the Participant.
 
(a) This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is made available to the Participant with this Agreement.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Acquisition Event (as defined in the Plan) that is not a Change in Control Event (as defined in the Plan), each RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Acquisition Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Common Stock subject to such RSU.
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (regardless of whether such event also constitutes an Acquisition Event), each RSU shall become exercisable, realizable or vested as to number of RSUs as would be vested pursuant to Section 2(a) as though the Grant Date were the date that is one year prior to the Grant Date; provided, however, in the event that upon the occurrence of Change in Control Event, the RSUs represented by this Agreement are not exchanged for a Replacement Award (as defined below), then each RSU shall immediately become fully vested as of immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control Event.
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, an award issuing by the acquiring company in a Change in Control Event shall qualify as a "Replacement Award" if (i) it has a value at least equal to the value of the RSUs represented by this Agreement (the "Replaced Award") as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; (ii) it relates to publicly traded equity securities of the Company or its successor in the Change in Control Event or another entity that is affiliated with the Company or its successor following the Change in Control Event; and (iii) its other terms and conditions are not less
 
favorable to the Participant than the terms and conditions of the Replaced Award. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Replaced Award if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this clause (d) are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change in Control Event, in its sole discretion.
(e) In the event that Participant's employment with the Corporation is terminated for a reason other than Cause (as defined above) within twelve months after a Change in Control Event, all then-unvested RSUs shall vest as of the date of termination of employment.
 
(a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer ("Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Unit award, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) In the event that the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division is required to withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the award or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, or the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division to satisfy all withholding and payment on account obligations of the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including the delivery of shares upon vesting, shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 7. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant from his or her wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may withhold in shares of Common Stock an amount of shares sufficient to cover the Participant's tax liability.
(c) The Participant will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan or the Participant's award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.
(d) As a condition to receiving any Shares, on the date of this Agreement, Participant must execute the Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares attached hereto, which authorizes the Company and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (or such substitute brokerage firm as is contracted to manage the Company's employee equity award program, the "Broker") to take the actions described in Section 7(b) and this Section 7(d) (the "Standing Order").
(e) Participant understands and agrees that the number of Shares that the Broker will sell will be based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the last trading day before the applicable Vesting Date. The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Section 7.
(f) Participant agrees that the proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to Section 7(d) will be used to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and, accordingly, Participant hereby authorizes the Broker to pay such proceeds to the Company for such purpose. Participant understands that to the
 
extent that the proceeds obtained by such sale exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items, such excess proceeds shall be deposited into the Participants account with Broker. Participant further understands that any remaining Shares shall be deposited into such account.
(g) The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock. The Participant and the Company have structured this Agreement to constitute a "binding contract" relating to the sale of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 7, consistent with the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act.
 
(a) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or purchasing shares hereunder). The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the vesting period, for any period, or at all.
No Rights to Employment
(b) . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
Severability
(c) . Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board of Directors of the Company.
Waiver
(d) . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Participant and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns, subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement.
Binding Effect
(e) . All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery or five days after deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party hereto at the address shown beneath his or its respective signature to this Agreement, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section 8(e).
Notice
(f) . Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.
Pronouns
(g) . This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control. In the event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, or any matters as to which this Agreement is silent, the Plan shall govern including, without limitation, the provisions thereof pursuant to which the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has the power, among other things, to (i) interpret the Plan, (ii) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan and (iii) make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
Entire Agreement; Conflicts and Interpretation
 
(h) . The Company may modify, amend or waive the terms of this Agreement prospectively or retroactively, but no such modification, amendment or waiver shall impair the rights of the Participant without his or her consent, except as required by applicable law, NASDAQ or stock exchange rules, tax rules or accounting rules. Any provision for the benefit of the Company contained in this Agreement may be waived, either generally or in any particular instance, by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of the Company. The waiver by either party of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement, or of any subsequent breach by such party of a provision of this Agreement.
Amendment
(i) . This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of laws.
Governing Law
(j) . The right of the Participant to receive Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement is an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. The Participant shall have no rights under this Agreement other than those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company.
Unfunded Rights
(k) . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to the RSUs awarded under and participation in the Plan or future options that may be awarded under the Plan by electronic means or to request the Participant's consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.
Electronic Delivery
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written. Electronic acceptance of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's instructions to Participant (including through an online acceptance process managed by the Company's agent) is acceptable.
 
 
The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed), the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.

Electronic Delivery
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written. Electronic acceptance of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's instructions to Participant (including through an online acceptance process managed by the Company's agent) is acceptable.
 
 
The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed) or as soon as practicable thereafter, the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.
 
 
 
The RSUs shall vest only upon the Company's achievement of certain financial performance and qualitative metrics for the applicable year established by the Chief Executive Officer (or, if the Participant is the Chief Executive Officer, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) ("Mission Critical Goals").
With respect to the financial performance, achievement shall be calculated based on actual corporate performance against a target of $            in respect of Normalized EPS (as defined below) for fiscal year 2012 (the "Target Metric") as reported in its Public Company Financial Statements for such year. The maximum amount issuable upon achievement against the Target Metric shall be 50% of the Maximum RSU Amount and is referred to herein as the "Financial Performance Component." If, on December 31, 2012, the Company is required to make periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company's consolidated financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K shall constitute its "Public Company Financial Statements" and shall apply. If, on December 31, 2012, the Company is not required to make periodic reports under the Exchange Act, the Company's regularly prepared annual audited financial statements prepared by management shall be its "Private Company Financial Statements" and shall apply. The applicable financial statements may be referred to herein as the "2012 Financial Statements."
"Normalized EPS" shall mean the Company's annual earnings per diluted share for the applicable fiscal year excluding cumulative amortization of other intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized software, restructuring charges and benefits, certain gains and losses on investments, utilization of NOL carryforwards and credits, loss on early extinguishment of debt and similar items excluded by Akamai in determining normalized earnings per share in issuing its earnings announcements for such fiscal year.
With respect to Mission Critical Goals, achievement shall be calculated based on a determination by the Chief Executive Officer (or, if the Participant is the Chief Executive Officer, by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors) as to whether the Participant has (i) partially achieved the Mission Critical Goals; (ii) achieved the Mission Critical Goals at the target level, or (iii) achieved the Mission Critical Goals at an outstanding level. The maximum amount issuable upon achievement against the Mission Critical Goals shall be 50% of the Maximum RSU Amount and is referred to herein as the "Mission Critical Goals Component."
 
1. Calculating Payout Against the Financial Performance Component
(a) If the actual performance against the Target Metric fails to exceed [        ]%, then no Shares shall be issuable in respect of the Financial Performance Component.
(b) If the actual performance against the Target Metric is 100%, then 50% of the Financial Performance Component shall become issuable (the "Target-Level Financial Performance Payout Amount").
 
(c) If the actual performance against the Target Metric is [        ]%, then 100% of the Financial Performance Component shall become issuable.
(d) If the actual performance is between [        ]% of the Target Metric and 100% of the Target Metric, then the number of Shares issuable shall equal the product of (i) the Target-Level Financial Performance Payout Amount multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is 100% minus the actual percentage performance against the Target Metric and the denominator is [        ]%, subject to the vesting schedule set forth in Paragraph 2(a) of the Agreement.
(e) If the actual performance is between 100% of the Target Metric and [        ]% of the Target Metric, then the number of Shares issuable shall equal the Target-Level Financial Performance Payout plus the product of (i) the Financial Performance Component minus the Target-Level Financial Performance Payout multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the actual percentage performance against the Target Metric minus 100% and the denominator is [        ]%, subject to the vesting schedule set forth in Paragraph 2(a) of the Agreement.
2. Calculating Payout Against the Mission Critical Goals Component
If is determined that there was partial achievement of Mission Critical Goals during the applicable year, then Shares representing 25% of the Mission Critical Goals Component shall become issuable. If it is determined that that there was target level achievement of Mission Critical Goals during the applicable year, then Shares representing 50% of the Mission Critical Goals Component shall become issuable. If it is determined that there was outstanding achievement of Mission Critical Goals during the applicable year, then Shares representing 100% of the Mission Critical Goals Component shall become issuable. If the Participant failed to meet the partial achievement level, then no Shares shall be issuable in respect of the Mission Critical Goals Components.
3. The sum of the amounts calculated pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall be the total amount of Shares issuable under this Agreement, subject to the vesting provisions set forth herein.
 
In the event that the Company enters into an Acquisition Transaction during the applicable year, then Normalized EPS shall be adjusted to give effect to such Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" means (i) the purchase by the Company of more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, (ii) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or share exchange which results in the Company acquiring more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, or (iii) the purchase or other acquisition (including, without limitation, via license outside of the ordinary course of business or joint venture) of assets that constitute more than 50% of another entity's total assets or assets that account for more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues or net income of such entity.
As soon as practicable following the closing of an Acquisition Transaction, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall make a determination of the estimated impact of the Acquisition Transaction on the Company's 2012 Normalized EPS through the applicable year. If the Acquisition Transaction is estimated to be accretive, then in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2012 Financial Statements, shall be reduced by the amount of the estimated Normalized EPS contribution from the Acquisition Transaction. If the Acquisition is estimated to be non-accretive, then in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2012 Financial Statements, shall be increased by the amount of the estimated negative Normalized EPS impact from the Acquisition Transaction. All determinations of the
 
Compensation Committee regarding the estimated impact of an Acquisition Transaction shall be final, binding and non-appealable. This Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended, without further action by the Company or the Participant, to give effect to any adjustments required by this Section C.
 
(1) If there is a Change of Control Event on or prior to December 31, 2012, then 50% of the Maximum RSU Amount shall vest as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event.
(2) If there is a Change of Control Event after December 31, 2012, then the number of vested Shares calculated pursuant to this Schedule 1 shall vest as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event (to the extent not previously vested under the Section 2(a) of the Agreement).
 
(1) If the Participant dies or is disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to December 31, 2012, then 50% of the Maximum RSU Amount shall vest as of the date of death.
(2) If the Participant dies or is disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) after December 31, 2012, then the number of vested Shares calculated pursuant to this Schedule 1 shall vest as of the date of death or disability (to the extent not previously vested under the Section 2(a) of the Agreement).
 

Exhibit 10.3
 
This Agreement evidences the grant by Akamai Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") on                     , 2012 (the "Grant Date") to you (the "Participant") of restricted stock units of the Company (individually, an "RSU" and collectively, the "RSUs"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the "Agreement") and the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan").

The shares of Common Stock that are issuable upon vesting of the RSUs are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings specified in the Plan.
 
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement including, without limitation, Paragraph 2(b) below, the number of Shares issuable pursuant to the calculation set forth in to this Agreement shall vest as follows: 50% on the second anniversary of the Grant Date and 50% on the third anniversary of the Grant Date. Such date or any other date on which shares vest under this Agreement may be referred to herein as a "Vesting Date."
Schedule 1
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2 or , RSUs shall not continue to vest unless the Participant is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee, officer or director of, or consultant or advisor to, the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, employment with the Company shall include employment with a parent, subsidiary, affiliate or division of the Company.
Schedule 1
 
(a) The Company will distribute to the Participant the Shares of Common Stock represented by vested RSUs as follows: within 30 days of the Vesting Date.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue to the Participant the Shares upon the vesting of any RSU (or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal or state securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may then be listed.
(c) Neither the Company nor the Participant shall have the right to accelerate or defer the deliver of any shares under this Agreement except to the extent specifically permitted under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, by operation of law or otherwise (collectively "transfer") any RSUs, or any interest therein, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
 
Except as set forth in the Plan, neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant shall be, or have any rights or privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in respect of the Shares issuable pursuant to the RSUs granted hereunder until the Shares have been delivered to the Participant.
 
(a) This Agreement is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is made available to the Participant with this Agreement.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Acquisition Event (as defined in the Plan), each RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall inure to the benefit of the Company's successor and shall apply to the cash, securities or other property which the Common Stock was converted into or exchanged for pursuant to such Acquisition Event in the same manner and to the same extent as they applied to the Common Stock subject to such RSU.
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (regardless of whether such event also constitutes an Acquisition Event), vesting of each RSU shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of to this Agreement.
Schedule 1
 
(a) Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's employer ("Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him or her is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Unit award, including the grant and vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents; and (2) do not commit to structure the terms of the award or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) In the event that the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division is required to withhold any Tax-Related Items as a result of the award or vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, or the receipt of cash or any dividends or dividend equivalents, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division to satisfy all withholding and payment on account obligations of the Company, subsidiary, affiliate or division. The obligations of the Company under this Agreement, including the delivery of shares upon vesting, shall be conditioned on compliance by the Participant with this Section 7. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant from his or her wages or other cash compensation paid to the Participant by the Company and/or the Employer. Alternatively, or in addition, if permissible under local law, the Company may withhold in shares of Common Stock an amount of shares sufficient to cover the Participant's tax liability.
 
(c) The Participant will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan or the Participant's award that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.

(or such substitute brokerage firm as is contracted to manage the Company's employee equity award program, the "Broker") to take the actions described in Section 7(b) and this Section 7(d) (the "Standing Order").
(e) Participant understands and agrees that the number of Shares that the Broker will sell will be based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the last trading day before the applicable Vesting Date. The Participant agrees to execute and deliver such documents, instruments and certificates as may reasonably be required in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Section 7.
(f) Participant agrees that the proceeds received from the sale of Shares pursuant to Section 7(d) will be used to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and, accordingly, Participant hereby authorizes the Broker to pay such proceeds to the Company for such purpose. Participant understands that to the extent that the proceeds obtained by such sale exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Tax-Related Items, such excess proceeds shall be deposited into the Participants account with Broker. Participant further understands that any remaining Shares shall be deposited into such account.
(g) The Participant represents to the Company that, as of the date hereof, he is not aware of any material nonpublic information about the Company or the Common Stock. The Participant and the Company have structured this Agreement to constitute a "binding contract" relating to the sale of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 7, consistent with the affirmative defense to liability under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under Rule 10b5-1(c) promulgated under such Act.
 
(a) . The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the RSUs pursuant to Section 2 hereof is earned only by continuing service as an employee at the will of the Company (not through the act of being hired or purchasing shares hereunder). The Participant further acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth herein do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an employee or consultant for the vesting period, for any period, or at all.

The Participant hereby consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and, if requested, to agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or another third party designated by the Company.
Electronic Delivery
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written. Electronic acceptance of this Agreement pursuant to the Company's instructions to Participant (including through an online acceptance process managed by the Company's agent) is acceptable.
 
 
The Participant has been granted restricted stock units ("RSUs") by Akamai Technologies, Inc. ("Akamai"), which is evidenced by a restricted stock unit agreement between me and Akamai (the "Agreement," copy attached). Provided that I remain employed by Akamai on each vesting date, the shares vest according to the provisions of the Agreement.
I understand that on each vesting date, the shares issuable in respect of vested RSUs (the "Shares") will be deposited into my account at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") and that I will recognize taxable ordinary income as a result. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and as a condition of my receipt of the Shares, I understand and agree that, for each vesting date, I must sell a number of shares sufficient to satisfy all withholding taxes applicable to that ordinary income. Therefore, I understand that Schwab will remit the proceeds to Akamai for payment of the withholding taxes.
I hereby direct Schwab to sell, at the market price and on each vesting date listed above (or the first business day thereafter if a vesting date should fall on a day when the market is closed) or as soon as practicable thereafter, the number of Shares that Akamai informs Schwab is sufficient to satisfy the applicable withholding taxes, which shall be calculated based on the closing price of Akamai's common stock on the last trading day before each vesting date.
I hereby agree to indemnify and hold Schwab harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, arising out of any (i) negligent act, omission or willful misconduct by Akamai in carrying out actions pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph and (ii) any action taken or omitted by Schwab in good faith reliance upon instructions herein or upon instructions or information transmitted to Schwab by Akamai pursuant to the third sentence of the preceding paragraph.
I understand and agree that by signing below or effecting an online acceptance of the Agreement, I am making an Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares which will remain in effect until all of the shares have vested. I also agree that this Irrevocable Standing Order to Sell Shares is in addition to and subject to the terms and conditions of any existing Account Agreement that I have with Schwab.
 
 
 
The RSUs shall vest only upon the Company's achievement of certain financial metrics based on a target of $            in respect of Normalized EPS (as defined below) for fiscal year 2012 (the "Target Metric") as reported in its Public Company Financial Statements for such year. If, on December 31, 2012, the Company is required to make periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company's consolidated financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K shall constitute its "Public Company Financial Statements" and shall apply. If, on December 31, 2012, the Company is not required to make periodic reports under the Exchange Act, the Company's regularly prepared annual audited financial statements prepared by management shall be its "Private Company Financial Statements" and shall apply. The applicable financial statements may be referred to herein as the "2012 Financial Statements."
"Normalized EPS" shall mean the Company's annual earnings per diluted share for the applicable fiscal year excluding cumulative amortization of other intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense reflected as a component of amortization of capitalized software, restructuring charges and benefits, certain gains and losses on investments, utilization of NOL carryforwards and credits, loss on early extinguishment of debt and similar items excluded by Akamai in determining normalized earnings per share in issuing its earnings announcements for such fiscal year.
 
1. If the actual performance fails to meet the Target Metric fails, then none of the Shares shall become issuable.
2. If the actual performance equals [        %] of the Target Metric or greater, then the Maximum RSU Amount shall become issuable, subject to the vesting schedule set forth in Paragraph 2(a) of the Agreement.
3. If the actual performance is between 100% of the Target Metric and [        ]% of the Target Metric, then the number of Shares issuable shall equal the product of (i) the Maximum RSU Amount multiplied by (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is the actual percentage performance against the Target Metric minus 100% and the denominator is [        ]%, subject to the vesting schedule set forth in Paragraph 2(a) of the Agreement.
 
In the event that the Company enters into an Acquisition Transaction during 2012, then Normalized EPS shall be adjusted to give effect to such Acquisition Transaction. An "Acquisition Transaction" means (i) the purchase by the Company of more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, (ii) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or share exchange which results in the Company acquiring more than 50% of the voting power of another entity, or (iii) the purchase or other acquisition (including, without limitation, via license outside of the ordinary course of business or joint venture) of assets that constitute more than 50% of another entity's total assets or assets that account for more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues or net income of such entity.
 
As soon as practicable following the closing of an Acquisition Transaction, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company shall make a determination of the estimated impact of the Acquisition Transaction on the Company's cumulative Normalized EPS through 2012. If the Acquisition Transaction is estimated to be accretive, then in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2012 Financial Statements, shall be reduced by the amount of the estimated Normalized EPS contribution from the Acquisition Transaction. If the Acquisition is estimated to be non-accretive, then in calculating Normalized EPS for purposes of determining the Normalized EPS Percentage Component, Normalized EPS, as calculated based on the 2012 Financial Statements, shall be increased by the amount of the estimated negative Normalized EPS impact from the Acquisition Transaction. All determinations of the Compensation Committee regarding the estimated impact of an Acquisition Transaction shall be final, binding and non-appealable. This Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically amended, without further action by the Company or the Participant, to give effect to any adjustments required by this Section C.
 
(1) If there is a Change of Control Event on or prior to December 31, 2012, then no Shares shall vest.
(2) If there is a Change of Control Event after December 31, 2012, then the number of vested Shares calculated pursuant to this Schedule 1 shall vest as of the closing date of the Change of Control Event (to the extent not previously vested under the Section 2(a) of the Agreement).
 
(1) If the Participant dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) after December 31, 2012, then no Shares shall vest.
(2) If the Participant dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) after December 31, 2012, then the number of vested Shares calculated pursuant to this Schedule 1 shall vest as of the date of death or disability (to the extent not previously vested under the Section 2(a) of the Agreement).
 

Exhibit 10.4
 
This Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (this "Agreement") evidences the grant by Akamai Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), on                      (the "Grant Date") to                     , an employee of the Company (the "Participant"), of an option to purchase, in whole or in part, on the terms provided herein and in the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), a total of                      shares (the "Shares") of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") at Exercise_Price per Share. Unless earlier terminated, this option shall expire on the seventh anniversary of the Grant Date (the "Final Exercise Date").
It is intended that the option evidenced by this agreement shall not be an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the term "Participant", as used in this option, shall be deemed to include any person who acquires the right to exercise this option validly under its terms.
 
(a) . This option will become exercisable ("vest") as to 33% of the original number of Shares on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date. For purposes of this Section 2(a) the Vesting Start Date shall be the Grant Date.
General
The right of exercise shall be cumulative so that to the extent the option is not exercised in any period to the maximum extent permissible it shall continue to be exercisable, in whole or in part, with respect to all shares for which it is vested until the earlier of the Final Exercise Date or the termination of this option under Section 3 hereof or the Plan.
(b) . Upon a Change in Control Event (as defined in the Plan), notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the number of Shares as to which this option has vested shall be calculated pursuant to Section 2(a) as though the Grant Date were the date that is one year prior to the Grant Date.
Change in Control
 
(a) . In order to exercise this option, the Participant shall notify the Company's third-party stock option plan administrator, Charles Schwab & Co., or any successor appointed by the Company (the "Plan Administrator"), of the Participant's intent to exercise this option, and shall follow the procedures established by the Plan Administrator for exercising stock options under the Plan and provide payment in full in the manner provided in the Plan. The Participant may purchase less than the number of shares covered hereby, provided that no partial exercise of this option may be for any fractional share.
Form of Exercise
 
(b) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3, this option may not be exercised unless the Participant, at the time he or she exercises this option, is, and has been at all times since the Grant Date, an employee of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company as defined in Section 424(e) or (f) of the Code (an "Eligible Participant").
Continuous Relationship with the Company Required
(c) . If the Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant for any reason, then, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) below, the right to exercise this option shall terminate three months after such cessation (but in no event after the Final Exercise Date), this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Participant was entitled to exercise this option on the date of such cessation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant, prior to the Final Exercise Date, violates the non-competition or confidentiality provisions of any employment contract, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement or other agreement between the Participant and the Company, the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon such violation.
Termination of Relationship with the Company
provided
that
(d) . If the Participant dies or becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code) prior to the Final Exercise Date while he or she is an Eligible Participant and the Company has not terminated such relationship for "cause" as specified in paragraph (e) below, this option shall be exercisable, within the period of one year following the date of death or disability of the Participant by the Participant, (i) this option shall be exercisable only to the extent that this option was exercisable by the Participant on the date of his or her death or disability, and (ii) this option shall not be exercisable after the Final Exercise Date.
Exercise Period Upon Death or Disability
provided
that
(e) . If the Participant, prior to the Final Exercise Date, is discharged by the Company for "cause" (as defined below), the right to exercise this option shall terminate immediately upon the effective date of such discharge. "Cause" shall mean willful misconduct by the Participant or willful failure by the Participant to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company (including, without limitation, breach by the Participant of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between the Participant and the Company), as determined by the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. The Participant shall be considered to have been discharged for "cause" if the Company determines, prior to or simultaneously with the Participant's resignation, that discharge for cause was warranted.
Discharge for Cause
 
No Shares will be issued pursuant to the exercise of this option unless and until the Participant pays to the Company, or makes provision satisfactory to the Company for payment of, any federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of this option.
 
This option may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Participant, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during the lifetime of the Participant, this option shall be exercisable only by the Participant.
 
This option is subject to the provisions of the Plan, a copy of which is furnished to the Participant with this option.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this option to be executed under its corporate seal by its duly authorized officer. This option shall take effect as a sealed instrument.
 
The undersigned hereby accepts the foregoing option and agrees to the terms and conditions thereof. The undersigned hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
