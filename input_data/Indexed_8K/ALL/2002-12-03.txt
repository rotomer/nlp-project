        On December 2, 2002, the Chicago Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) dismissed the petition of the United Exclusive Allstate Agents, Office and Professional Employees International Union in which the union had sought to be certified as the collective bargaining representative of all Allstate agents in the United States. The Regional Director agreed with The Allstate Corporation's position that the agents are independent contractors, not employees, and that, consequently, the NLRB lacks jurisdiction over the issue. The dismissal is subject to appeal to the NLRB in Washington, DC.
        Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
