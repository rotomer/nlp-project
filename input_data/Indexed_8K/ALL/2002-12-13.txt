Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants ------------------------------ to, and agrees with, each of the Underwriters that: (a) The Company meets the requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-39640) under the Act, which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the Securities (such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement"). No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement is in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose are pending before or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the Commission. The Company proposes to
file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act a supplement or supplements to the form of prospectus included in the Registration Statement relating to the Securities and the plan of distribution thereof; such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus"; and such supplemented form of prospectus, in the form in which it shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus." Any preliminary form of the Final Prospectus which has heretofore been filed pursuant to Rule 424 is hereinafter called the "Preliminary Final Prospectus." Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. (b) As of the date hereof, when the Final Prospectus is first filed or transmitted for filing pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, when, prior to the Time of Delivery (as hereinafter defined), any amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), when any supplement to the Final Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the Time of Delivery, (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture complied and will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder and (ii) neither the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, nor the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of such time, contained or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) the parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustees (the "Form T-1") or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to such Underwriter or the underwriting arrangements furnished in writing to the Company by any Underwriter specifically for use in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus. (c) Each document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, at the time they were, or hereafter are, filed with the Commission, complied or will comply and, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, will comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 2
(d) The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (e) Each subsidiary of the Company listed in Schedule III hereto (each, a "Principal Subsidiary") has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to own its property and to conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Principal Subsidiaries are currently the only operating insurance companies that are "significant subsidiaries" of the Company as that term is defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act. (f) All of the issued shares of capital stock of each Principal Subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned of record directly or indirectly by the Company or another Principal Subsidiary, as the case may be, free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance. (g) Each Principal Subsidiary is duly licensed or authorized as an insurer or reinsurer in each jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed, except where the failure to be so licensed or authorized in any such jurisdiction does not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; the Company and each Principal Subsidiary have made all required filings under applicable insurance holding company statutes, and each is duly licensed or authorized as an insurance holding company in each jurisdiction where it is required to be so licensed, except where the failure to have made such filings or to be so licensed or authorized in any such jurisdiction does not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; the Company and each Principal Subsidiary have all necessary authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications of and from all insurance regulatory authorities to conduct their respective businesses as described in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, except where the failure to have such authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications does not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and none of the Company or any Principal Subsidiary has received any notification from any insurance regulatory authority to the effect that any additional authorization, approval, order, consent, registration or qualification from such insurance regulatory authority is needed to be obtained by any of the Company or any Principal Subsidiary in any case where it could be reasonably expected that (x) the Company or any Principal Subsidiary would in fact be required either to obtain any such additional authorization, approval, order, consent, registration or qualification or cease or otherwise limit writing certain business 3
and (y) obtaining such authorization, approval, order, consent, license, certificate, permit, registration or qualification or limiting such business would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (h) Each Principal Subsidiary is in compliance with the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of its state of incorporation and the insurance laws and regulations of other jurisdictions which are applicable to such Principal Subsidiary, and has filed all notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed thereunder, except where the failure to so comply or file would not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (i) Other than as set forth in the Final Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened. (j) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company. (k) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as (i) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) rights of acceleration and the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable principles of general applicability. (l) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when the Securities are issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, such Securities will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture. (m) The issuance and sale of the Securities and compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and this Agreement will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument for borrowed money to which the Company or any Principal Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or insurance regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries or any of their properties, in each case other than such breaches, conflicts, violations or defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, and no 4
authorization, approval, order, consent, registration or qualification of or with any such court or insurance regulatory authority or other governmental agency or body is required for the issue or sale of the Securities, except such authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state or foreign securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, in each case other than such authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications which (individually or in the aggregate) the failure to make, obtain or comply with would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. (n) Except as described in or contemplated by the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the business, properties, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there has not been any material increase in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus) or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Final Prospectus. (o) There are no material contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to file a registration statement under the Act with respect to any notes or debt of the Company owned or to be owned by such person or to require the Company to include such securities for registration pursuant to the Registration Statement or pursuant to any other registration statement filed by the Company under the Act. (p) The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described in the Final Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

qualifications of and from all insurance regulatory authorities to conduct their respective businesses as described in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, except where the failure to have such authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications does not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and none of the Company or any Principal Subsidiary has received any notification from any insurance regulatory authority to the effect that any additional authorization, approval, order, consent, registration or qualification from such insurance regulatory authority is needed to be obtained by any of the Company or any Principal Subsidiary in any case where it could be reasonably expected that (x) the Company or any Principal Subsidiary would in fact be required either to obtain any such additional authorization, approval, order, consent, registration or qualification or cease or otherwise limit writing certain business and (y) obtaining such authorization, approval, order, consent, license, certificate, permit, registration or qualification or limiting such business would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (such counsel being entitled to rely, with respect to the opinion in this clause (iii), upon opinions of local or in-house counsel and, in respect of matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (iv) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry, each Principal Subsidiary is in compliance with the requirements of the insurance laws and regulations of its state of incorporation and the insurance laws and regulations of other jurisdictions which are applicable to such Principal Subsidiary, and has filed all notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed thereunder, or is subject to no material liability or disability by reason of the failure to so comply or file (such counsel being entitled to rely, with respect to this clause (iv), upon opinions of local or in-house counsel and, in respect of matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (v) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry, and other than as set forth in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened; (vi) The issuance and sale of the Securities and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Indenture, the Securities and this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated therein and herein will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other material agreement or instrument relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as such agreements or instruments have been amended (which indentures, mortgages, deeds of trust, loan agreements or other agreements or instruments may be specified by such counsel on a schedule attached to his opinion); nor will any such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company or any of its Principal Subsidiaries or any applicable United States law or statute or any order, rule or regulation of any United States court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective 11
properties, provided, that the foregoing opinion is limited to those statutes, laws, rules and regulations of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the State of Illinois, in each case, which, in the opinion of such counsel, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, and provided further, that no opinion need be given with respect to (A) the Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act, the rules and regulations issued pursuant to each such act, any order, rule or regulation made or established by any insurance official or regulatory authority or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters or (B) conflicts, breaches or violations which individually and in the aggregate both would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not have a material adverse effect on the sale or ownership of the Securities (such counsel being entitled to rely, with respect to the opinion in this clause (vi), upon opinions of local or in-house counsel and, in respect of matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the Company or its subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both you and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and certificates); (vii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any United States court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that such counsel need not express any opinion with respect to such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations or qualifications (A) as may be required under the Act, the Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act, the rules and regulations issued pursuant to each such act, any order, rule or regulation made or established by any insurance official or regulatory authority or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (B) as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by the Underwriters, (C) the absence of which individually or in the aggregate both are not material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole and would not have a material adverse effect on the sale or ownership of the Securities or (D) as may be required under foreign laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Securities by any international managers; provided, that the foregoing opinion is limited to those consents, approvals, authorizations, orders, registrations and qualifications under laws which, in the experience of such counsel, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement; (viii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry, the Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, have filed all notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed pursuant to, and have obtained all authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications required to be obtained under, and have otherwise complied with all requirements of, all applicable insurance laws and regulations known to such counsel to be normally applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Securities and, except as have been obtained pursuant to the foregoing clause, no filing, authorization, approval, order, consent, registration or qualification of or 12
with any insurance regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties known to such counsel to be normally applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Indenture is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except such filings, authorizations, approvals, orders, consents, registrations or qualifications which (individually or in the aggregate) the failure to make, obtain or comply with would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or a material adverse effect on the sale or ownership of the Securities; (ix) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry, there are no material contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to file a registration statement under the Act with respect to any notes or debt of the Company owned or to be owned by such person or to require the Company to include such securities for registration pursuant to the Registration Statement or pursuant to any other registration statement filed by the Company under the Act. (x) As general counsel to the Company, such counsel reviewed the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, participated in various discussions with representatives of the Underwriters and of the Company and its accountants at which contents of the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented were discussed; on the basis of the information that such counsel gained in the course of his activities referred to above and as general counsel, such counsel confirms that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented (in each case other than with respect to the financial statements, financial and accounting data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion or belief), appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and, although such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented (except as expressly set forth in such opinion), on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel in the course of such review which has caused such counsel to believe that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and financial and accounting data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1, and other than information under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Debt Warrants," "Description of Preferred Stock," "Description of Preferred Securities," "Description of Preferred Securities Guarantees" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Basic Prospectus and under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Underwriting" contained in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as of its date, the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and financial and accounting data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1, and other than information under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Debt Warrants," "Description of Preferred Stock," "Description of Preferred Securities," "Description of Preferred Securities Guarantees" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Basic Prospectus and under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Underwriting" contained in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements 13
therein not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery, either the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any further amendment or supplement (when considered together with the document to which such supplement relates) thereto made by the Company prior to such Time of Delivery (other than the financial statements and financial and accounting data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom or the exhibits to the Registration Statement, including the Form T-1, and other than information under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Debt Warrants," "Description of Preferred Stock," "Description of Preferred Securities," "Description of Preferred Securities Guarantees" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Basic Prospectus and under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Underwriting" contained in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and he does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement required to be filed or of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not filed or described as required, in each case, other than with respect to the information under the captions "Description of Debt Securities," "Description of Debt Warrants," "Description of Preferred Stock," "Description of Preferred Securities," "Description of Preferred Securities Guarantees" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Basic Prospectus and under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Underwriting" contained in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented; and (xi) On the basis of the information that such counsel gained in the course of the review referred to in paragraph (x) above and as general counsel (but without passing upon or assuming any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the documents described below), such counsel confirms that no facts have come to the attention of such counsel in the course of such review which have caused such counsel to believe that the documents incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than the financial statements and financial and accounting data and related schedules incorporated by reference or included therein or excluded therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), when they 14
became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, did not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and he has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in the case of a registration statement which became effective under the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or, in the case of other documents that were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading. (d) The Representatives shall have received from Willkie Farr & Gallagher, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Final Prospectus as amended and supplemented and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for this purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, General Counsel or Treasurer of the Company, dated the Time of Delivery, to the effect that the signatory of such certificate has carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and this Agreement and that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Time of Delivery with the same effect as if made on the Time of Delivery and the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Time of Delivery; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) since the date of the Final Prospectus there has occurred no event required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Final Prospectus, and there has been no document required to be filed under the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder which, upon filing, would be deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus which has not been so filed. (f) On the date hereof, Deloitte & Touche shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated the date hereof, to the effect set forth in Schedule IV hereto. As of the Time of Delivery, Deloitte & Touche shall have furnished to the Representatives a letter, dated as of the Time of Delivery, reaffirming, as of such date, all of the statements set forth in Schedule IV hereto and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives. 15
(g) Subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any of Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation or any public notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (h) Prior to or at the Time of Delivery, the Company shall have furnished or shall furnish to the Representatives such additional certificates of officers of the Company as to such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 7 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Time of Delivery by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 7 shall be delivered at the office of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, counsel to the Underwriters, at 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at the Time of Delivery. 8. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the --------------------------------------- Securities provided herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 7 (other than Section 7(d)) hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11(i) hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure by the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. on demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 9. Indemnification and Contribution. -------------------------------- (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as: (i) such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto; or (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Company agrees to reimburse 16
each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case arising in connection with this Section 9 to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and, provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Underwriter under the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented, as the case may be, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from the fact such Underwriter sold the Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Final Prospectus or of the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, whichever is most recent, in any case where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Underwriter and the loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Final Prospectus which was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented). This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or Final Prospectus is as follows: under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution," (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party: (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by 17
the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below) and to participate in and assume the defense of the claim associated with such action; provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if: (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 9 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things: (i) whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other; (ii) the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge; (iii) access to information; and (iv) the opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and 18
equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 9, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 10. Defaulting Underwriters. If any one or more Underwriters shall ----------------------- fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by the Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names on Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth on Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without any liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Time of Delivery shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 11. Termination. This Agreement is subject to termination in the ----------- absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplements thereto). 19
12. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective ------------------------------------------ agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Section 8 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 13. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and ------- effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., 1 Bank One Plaza, Chicago, IL 60670, Attention: Attn: Syndicate Desk, 7th Floor (fax no. 312-732-3008), with a copy to the General Counsel, Banc One Capital Markets, Inc., 1 Bank One Plaza, Chicago, IL 60670, Attention: General Counsel (fax no. 312-732-5114); or if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary. 14. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement will inure to the benefit ---------------------- of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agent and controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 15. Time; 'Business Day'. As used herein, the term `business day' --------------------- shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday or a day on which banking institutions or trust companies are authorized or obligated by law to close in New York City. 16. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE ------------- GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 17. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of ------------ the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. 20

Section 901(7) of the Indenture provides for the Company and the Trustee to enter into an indenture supplemental to the Indenture to establish the form or terms of Securities of any series as provided by Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture. NOW, THEREFORE, THIS NINTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE WITNESSETH: For and in consideration of the premises and the issuance of the series of Securities provided for herein, it is mutually agreed, for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders of the Securities of such series, as follows: ARTICLE I Relation to Indenture; Definitions Section 1.1.

LIMITATION ON AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. The aggregate principal amount of the Securities shall initially be limited to $250,000,000. The Company may, without the consent of the holders of the Securities, issue additional Securities having the same interest rate, maturity date and other terms as described in the related prospectus supplement and prospectus. Any additional Securities, together with the Securities offered by the related prospectus supplement, will constitute a single series of Securities under the Indenture. No additional Securities may be issued if an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities. Section 2.3. PRINCIPAL PAYMENT DATE. The principal amount of the Securities outstanding (together with any accrued and unpaid interest) shall be payable in a single installment on December 15, 2032, which date shall be the Stated Maturity of the Securities Outstanding. Section 2.4. INTEREST AND INTEREST RATES. The rate of interest on each Security shall be 6.125% per annum, accruing from December 17, 2002, or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year commencing June 15, 2003 until the principal thereof shall have become due and payable, and until the principal thereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment. The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on any Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). A "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks in the City of New York and Boston, Massachusetts are not required by law to close.

close of business on June 1 or December 1 prior to such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for in respect of any Security shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holders of this series of Securities not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. Section 2.5. PLACE OF PAYMENT. The Place of Payment where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for payment, where the Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demand to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and the Indenture may be served shall be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. Section 2.6. REDEMPTION. (a) The Company may redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such securities to be redeemed or (ii) an amount, as determined by an Independent Investment Banker, equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points, plus, in either of the above cases, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.

If no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or 3
- if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the securities to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such securities ("Remaining Life"). "Comparable Treasury Price" means (i) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means: - each of Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. and UBS Warburg LLC and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and - any three other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City Time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. The Company will mail a notice of redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the securities to be redeemed. If less than all of the securities are to be redeemed, the trustee will select, by such method as it will deem fair and appropriate, including pro rata or by lot, the securities to be redeemed in whole or in part. 4
Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the securities or portions thereof called for redemption.

The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
