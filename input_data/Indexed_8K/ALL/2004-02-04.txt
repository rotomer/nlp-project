        On February 4, 2004, the registrant issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99 to this report.

Exhibit 99
For Immediate Release
        NORTHBROOK, Ill., Feb. 4, 2004The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported for the fourth quarter of 2003:
 - 
Property-Liability premiums written(1) grew 6% over the fourth quarter of 2002. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums written increased 31% and 39%, respectively.
 - 
Property-Liability underwriting income(1) increased 272% or $353 million in the fourth quarter to $483 million from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 due to higher premiums earned and continued favorable auto and homeowners loss frequencies, partially offset by higher catastrophes.
 - 
Catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter increased to $412 million compared to $237 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The impact of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio increased to 6.5 pts from 4.0 pts in the fourth quarter of 2002.
 - 
Allstate Financial had premiums and deposits(1) of $3.30 billion, 20% over the prior year fourth quarter.
 - 
At its February 3, 2004 meeting, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share, which is a 22% increase from the previous quarter. The board also approved a $1 billion increase of the current share repurchase program, which has $350 million remaining. The expanded program is expected to be completed in 2005.
 - 
Allstate's operating income per diluted share guidance(1) for 2004 (assuming the level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the year) is in the range of $4.30 to $4.55.
        "Allstate had a strong quarter and an outstanding year," said Chairman, President and CEO Edward M. Liddy. "I am very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, which showed good top line growth, strong unit growth for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners and outstanding bottom line results.
        "Just as impressive were our results for the entire year. Compared to 2002, net income more than doubled to $2.7 billion, consolidated revenues were up almost 9% to $32.1 billion, and operating income

was up 28% to $2.7 billion. And looking at our results since becoming a public company more than 10 years ago, 2003 marked a year in which we achieved the second highest net income per diluted share, the largest amount of written premium and the highest operating income (in total dollars and per diluted share), all while experiencing the largest amount of catastrophe losses since 1994, which included the Northridge earthquake.
        "Despite this year's excellent results, we will not rest on this success. Our goals remain unchanged and our strategy continues to be validated and well executed. We are seeking long-term, sustainable, profitable growth and 2003 helped us continue the momentum that began more than eight quarters ago. We want to be better and bigger in our protection business and broader in financial services and we are very optimistic about our prospects for 2004 and beyond. We have a good record of executing on our strategies and remain focused on underwriting and pricing discipline as we grow the company," said Liddy.
        In the quarter, we appointed a new chief marketing officer and launched a new multi-million dollar advertising campaign. Both of these moves are intended to help us grow our business and reach more households. In addition to the investments in advertising, we have invested in our agency force, growing it by 5 percent or some 600 exclusive agencies this year, including approximately 200 exclusive financial specialists, thereby increasing our proprietary distribution capacity for financial services products.
        New business growth in our Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners insurance lines was strong. Standard auto and homeowners new business premiums written increased 31% and 39%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, policies in force for these two lines continued a trend that began in the second quarter of 2003 by showing sequential positive unit growth of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively, compared to the third quarter.
        "During the quarter, Allstate Protection experienced excellent auto and homeowners loss frequency trends. Catastrophe losses were much higher this quarter, largely as a result of losses suffered by our policyholders in Southern California due to severe wildfires that struck the area. I am particularly proud of our Allstate agents and claim adjusters and their commitment to restoring the lives of our customers in a state that not only experienced devastating fires, but mudslides and even an earthquake during the quarter," continued Liddy.
        In an increasingly competitive environment, Allstate Financial had mixed results in the quarter. Premiums and deposits were up 20 percent and revenues were up 6 percent, while operating income was down 36 percent reflecting the impact of several non-recurring items.
        To better position itself for the competitive pressures and challenges in the financial services marketplace, Allstate Financial is pursuing a strategy of operational excellence which emphasizes focused product manufacturing for our targeted distribution partners to enable them to serve their clients' financial protection, savings and retirement needs. The results of this concentrated effort started to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2003 as non-deferred operating expenses, net of restructuring charges, were flat with the prior year's fourth quarter. In addition, Allstate Financial introduced an innovative and flexible living benefit guarantee on its variable annuities in January 2004. The TrueReturn Accumulation Benefit feature replaced the income benefit previously offered. These initiatives, along with expectations of improving economic conditions, are expected to drive higher revenue and operating income in 2004 and subsequent years.

        "Overall, I am very optimistic about our ability to continue the momentum we generated over the past two years and believe strongly that we can continue to deliver excellent value to our shareholders. We have added $1 billion to our share repurchase program, significantly increased our dividend, continue to maintain a strong competitive position in all our businesses and we know how to execute. More than ever before, 'You're in good hands with Allstate'," said Liddy.
Consolidated Highlights
 - 
Book value per diluted share increased 17.3% compared to December 31, 2002. The minimum pension liability adjustment impacted book value per share $0.51 and $1.16 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in the minimum pension liability at December 31, 2003 was due to contributions during 2003 totaling $871 million and the impact of market appreciation on the valuation of plan assets.
 - 
The Board of Directors declared a dividend of twenty-eight cents ($0.28) on each outstanding share of stock. This dividend is payable in cash on April 1, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004.
Property-Liability Highlights
 - 
Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners policies in force (PIF) increased 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively, from September 30, 2003 levels, resulting in the third consecutive sequential quarterly increase in standard auto PIF and the fifth consecutive sequential quarterly increase in homeowners PIF. Both standard auto and homeowners experienced growth in most states. In total, Allstate brand standard auto, non-standard auto and homeowners PIF increased 0.8% as of December 31, 2003 when compared to December 31, 2002. These results exclude impacts from Allstate Canada and Allstate Motor Club.
 - 
In addition to higher new business premiums written during the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the prior year fourth quarter, the retention ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto increased to 90.1 as of December 31, 2003 compared to 88.9 as of December 31, 2002. The retention ratio for Allstate brand homeowners was 87.5 as of December 31, 2003 compared to 87.8 as of December 31, 2002.These results exclude impacts from Allstate Canada.
Allstate Financial Highlights
 - 
Premiums and deposits for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 19.6% over the prior year fourth quarter due to strong sales of institutional products, variable annuities and life products, partially offset by lower fixed annuity sales.
 - 
Net cash payments for Allstate Financial's variable annuity guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) were $16 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, net of reinsurance, hedging gains and losses, and other contractual arrangements. This is $6 million less than payments made in the fourth quarter of 2002, and $3 million less than the third quarter of 2003 payments.
GMDB values in excess of contractholders' account values, payable if all contractholders were to have died at December 31, 2003, were estimated to be $2.46 billion, net of reinsurance, compared to $3.13 billion at September 30, 2003 and $4.07 billion at December 31, 2002.
 - 
The weighted average interest crediting rate on fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life products in force, excluding market value adjusted annuities, was approximately 70 basis points more than the underlying long-term guaranteed rates on these products.

To conform to current period presentations, certain prior period balances have been reclassified. The reclassifications result in periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments held for economic hedging purposes but categorized as "non-hedge" for accounting purposes, being classified consistent with the corresponding fair value adjustments on such instruments. The tables above include the following reclassifications:
The net impact of the reclassifications on realized capital gains and losses, pretax, are offset by a corresponding change to net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds.

Increases in the expense ratio for the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from higher agent incentives, charitable contributions, marketing and employee-related expenses.

The adoption of FIN No. 46R caused long-term debt to increase by $1.04 billion in 2003. Of the increase, $691 million was recognized in the fourth quarter in connection with the consolidation of two investment management entities used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors. The remaining increase primarily related to the consolidation of an entity used to acquire a headquarters office building and up to 38 automotive collision repair stores, and the deconsolidation of an entity used to issue mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Although consolidation was required under FIN No. 46R for the two investment management entities, Allstate has no direct legal ownership of the assets consolidated and no obligation to repay the related notes whose only recourse is to the assets of the individual investment management entities. Allstate's maximum loss exposure related to its investment in the two investment management entities is the current carrying value of its equity investment, which totaled $12 million at December 31, 2003.

Change in other investments, net includes $46 million of cash held by the investment management entities included on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position due to the initial adoption of FIN No. 46R. The adoption of FIN 46R also resulted in an increase to long-term debt and investment assets. However, since these changes are non-cash items, they had no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
        We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures. Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
        
Operating income
is income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, excluding:
 - 
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,
 - 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC"), to the extent that it resulted from the recognition of realized capital gains and losses, and
 - 
(loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax.
        In the fourth quarter of 2003 it was necessary to revise our reconciliation of operating income to reflect the reclassification in the consolidated financial statements of the periodic settlements and accruals for non-hedge derivatives to realized capital gains and losses. With the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 in the third quarter of 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust are deconsolidated, dividends on the preferred securities are no longer reported in the consolidated financial statements and the interest on the related junior debentures is prospectively recognized in interest expense and included in operating income.
        Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income.
        We use operating income to evaluate our results of operations and as an integral component for incentive compensation. It reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses and (loss) gain on disposition of operations. These items may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, we reclassify periodic settlements on non-hedge derivative instruments into operating income to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investment or product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) and thereby appropriately reflect trends in product performance. Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator. Operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
        The following tables reconcile operating income and net income for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
For the three months ended December 31,
For the twelve months ended December 31,
        In this press release, we provide guidance on operating income per diluted share for 2004 (assuming a level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the year). A reconciliation of this measure to net income is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of
realized capital gains and losses including periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which can vary substantially from one period to another and may have a significant impact on net income. Because a forecast of realized capital gains and losses is not accessible, neither is a forecast of the effects of DAC amortization on realized capital gains and losses nor income taxes. The other reconciling items between operating income and net income on a forward-looking basis are (loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax, which we assume to be zero in 2004, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, for which impacts are currently not determinable.
        
Underwriting income (loss)
is premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP. Management uses this measure in its evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business. A reconciliation of Property-Liability Underwriting income to net income is provided in the Segment Results table.
        
Operating income return on equity
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of the beginning and end of the 12-month period shareholders' equity after excluding the after-tax effect of unrealized net capital gains. We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on equity. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period: the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Return on equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The following table shows the two computations.
Operating Measures
        We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measures. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
        
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned.
        
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales. It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.
        The following table illustrates where premiums and deposits are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
(1)
Life and annuity contract charges in the amount of est. $247 million and $230 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and est. $939 million and $922 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which are also revenues recognized for GAAP, have been excluded from the table above, but are a component of the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item "Life and annuity premiums and contract charges."
(2)
Derived directly from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
        
New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies
is an operating measure that we use to quantify the current year sales of financial products by the Allstate proprietary distribution channel. New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies includes annual premiums on new insurance policies, initial premiums and deposits on annuities, net new deposits in the Allstate Bank, sales of other company's mutual funds, and excludes renewal premiums. New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 totaled est. $1.83 billion and $1.61 billion, respectively.
        This press release contains forward-looking statements about our operating income for 2004. These statements are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons. Weighted average rate changes and the annual impact of rate changes on premiums written in our Property-Liability business may be lower than projected due to a decrease in PIF. Loss costs in our Property-Liability business, including losses due to catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes, may exceed management's projections. In addition, claim frequency could be higher than expected. Lower interest rates and equity market returns could increase DAC amortization, reduce contract charges, investment margins and the profitability of the Allstate Financial segment. We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements. This press release contains unaudited financial information.
