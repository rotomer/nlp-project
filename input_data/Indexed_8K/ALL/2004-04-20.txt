EXHIBIT 99
For Immediate Release
        NORTHBROOK, Ill., Apr. 20, 2004The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported for the first quarter of 2004:
 - 
Property-Liability premiums written(1) grew 6.7% over the first quarter of 2003. Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums written both increased 43%.
 - 
Property-Liability underwriting income(1) increased 109% or $452 million in the first quarter to $865 million from $413 million in the first quarter of 2003 due to higher premiums earned, continued favorable auto and homeowners loss frequencies, and lower catastrophes. The combined ratio decreased 6.7 points to 86.4 in the first quarter of 2004.
 - 
Catastrophe losses in the first quarter decreased to $102 million compared to $133 million in the first quarter of 2003. The impact of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio decreased to 1.6 pts from 2.2 pts in the first quarter of 2003.
 - 
Allstate Financial had premiums and deposits(1) of $3.46 billion, a 38% increase over the first quarter of 2003. Operating income was $132 million compared to $82 million in the first quarter of 2003.
 - 
Allstate's annual operating income per diluted share guidance(1) for 2004 (assuming the level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year) is in the range of $4.80 to $5.10, compared to the previously announced range of $4.30 to $4.55.
        "This was an outstanding quarter for Allstate. We're off to a great start for 2004," said Chairman, President and CEO Edward M. Liddy. "Simply put, our strategy is to grow profitably and this quarter's results very clearly indicate we are succeeding. And we have every intention of continuing the momentum.
        "I am especially pleased with the fact that this was the first time operating income reached $1 billion for a quarter. The fact is that good news is coming from across the enterpriseAllstate Protection, Allstate Financial and Investment units all generated strong results.

Measures used in this release that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and operating measures are defined in the "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" section of this document.
        "In our Property-Liability business, premiums written were up more than 6% in an environment of moderating rate activity. Policies in force (PIF) showed healthy growth. In particular, Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners business PIF grew 3.6% and 4.6% respectively, as compared to the first quarter of 2003. We retained more customers as evidenced by the improvement in our retention ratio. And while we were pleased with our underwriting performance, results also benefited from lower catastrophe losses and the mild winter, which contributed to favorable auto and homeowners loss frequency trends.
        "Our efforts to expand the reach of our brand through marketing and advertising are achieving success. We are reaching shoppers at targeted levels and our advertising is being well received. Our competitive position remains strong across the country as evidenced by the growth rates of our core lines. New business premiums written for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners increased 43% compared to the first quarter of 2003. Our Strategic Risk Management approach continues to work well at attracting our target customers, which are those that tend to buy multiple products and stay with the company for a longer period of time," continued Liddy.
        "I am also pleased with the performance of our Allstate Exclusive Agencies. They are clearly executing our strategy to get better and bigger in our property-casualty business while also making solid contributions to becoming broader in financial services. New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies(1) for the first quarter of 2004 were $491 million, a 36% increase from the first quarter of 2003. We have an agency force that is committed to fulfilling our customers' needs and reaching more customers.
        "At Allstate Financial, the results are encouraging, with higher sales and operating income. Premiums and deposits increased by $959 million or 38% in the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter. In particular, we identified and took advantage of opportunities in our institutional medium-term note program and issued $1.1 billion in funding agreements in the quarter. In addition, operating income was $132 million in the quarter," said Liddy. "Growth in investments, including separate accounts assets, was also strong increasing to $80.1 billion, an increase of $11.9 billion or 17% as compared to the first quarter of 2003.
        "Overall, the strategy for Allstate Financial remains focused on operational excellence while emphasizing product manufacturing for targeted distribution partners. Allstate Financial has exposure to economic conditions, which includes the impact that low interest rates has on certain products. Nonetheless, as economic conditions improve we expect favorable trends in operating income in 2004 and subsequent years.
        "Lastly, on the strength of this quarter and confidence that favorable trends will continue, we are increasing our operating income per diluted share guidance for 2004 to a range of $4.80 to $5.10 (assuming the level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year)."
Consolidated Highlights
 - 
Book value per diluted share increased 19.5% compared to March 31, 2003 and 5.0% compared to December 31, 2003.
Property-Liability Highlights
 - 
Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners policies in force (PIF) increased 3.6% and 4.6%, respectively, from March 31, 2003 levels. Both standard auto and homeowners experienced growth in most states. These results exclude impacts from Allstate Canada.
 - 
In addition to higher new business premiums written during the first quarter of 2004 compared to the prior year first quarter, the retention ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners increased to 90.5 and 87.8 as of March 31, 2004. These results exclude impacts from Allstate Canada.
Allstate Financial Highlights
 - 
Investments including separate accounts assets for the first quarter of 2004 increased 17.5% over the prior year first quarter due to market improvements and strong sales.
 - 
The weighted average interest crediting rate on fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life products in force, excluding market value adjusted annuities, was approximately 60 basis points more than the underlying long-term guaranteed rates on these products for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The crediting rate on approximately 40% of these contracts was at the contractually guaranteed minimum rate as of March 31, 2004.
 - 
SOP 03-01 was adopted as of January 1, 2004. It requires the establishment of reserves primarily for benefit guarantees provided under variable annuity contracts. In determining these reserves, this statement requires the consideration of a range of potential results under various economic scenarios, which generally necessitates the use of stochastic modeling techniques. The implementation of this new modeling approach resulted in changes to expected future gross profits, and therefore resulted in a write-down of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"). The impact of implementing this SOP on January 1, 2004, recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, was a $145 million increase in benefit reserves and an additional $124 million in DAC and DSI amortization or an aggregate of $269 million before-tax, $175 million after-tax.
 - 
Operating income of the Allstate Financial direct response distribution business was $3 million lower in the first quarter of 2004 than the first quarter of 2003 due to the disposition of the majority of that business. This included reductions in total revenues of $59 million, operating costs and expenses of $23 million and amortization of DAC of $8 million. The revenue decrease also contributed to a decline in the mortality margin related to the disposition of this business of $35 million in the first quarter of 2004 when compared to the first quarter of 2003.

        We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures. Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
        
Operating income
is income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, excluding:
 - 
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,
 - 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), to the extent that they resulted from the recognition of realized capital gains and losses, and
 - 
(loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax.
        Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income.
        We use operating income to evaluate our results of operations and as an integral component for incentive compensation. It reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses and (loss) gain on disposition of operations. These items may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, we reclassify periodic settlements on non-hedge derivative instruments into operating income to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investment or product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) and thereby appropriately reflect trends in product performance. Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator. Operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
        The following tables reconcile operating income and net income for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003.
        In this press release, we provide guidance on operating income per diluted share for 2004 (assuming a level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year). A reconciliation of this measure to net income is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of realized capital gains and losses including periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which can vary substantially from one period to another and may have a significant impact on net income. Because a forecast of realized capital gains and losses is not accessible, neither is a forecast of the effects of amortization of DAC and DSI on realized capital gains and losses nor income taxes. The other reconciling items between operating income and net income on a forward-looking basis are (loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, after-tax, which we assume to be zero for the remainder of the year.
        
Underwriting income (loss)
is premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP. Management uses this measure in its evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results. It is also an integral component of incentive compensation. We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business. A reconciliation of Property-Liability Underwriting income to net income is provided in the Segment Results table.
        
Operating income return on equity
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of the beginning and end of the 12-month period shareholders' equity after excluding the after-tax effect of unrealized net capital gains. We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on equity. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period: the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Return on equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. The following table shows the two computations.
        
Investment margin
represents the excess of net investment income over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in Allstate Financial's reserve for life-contingent contract benefits. We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and the amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period.
        
Mortality margin
represents life and annuity premiums and cost of insurance contract charges less related policy and contract benefits. We use mortality margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's underwriting performance as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period.
        
Gross margin
represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges and net investment income, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds. We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financial's life insurance and financial product portfolio. Additionaly, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest-sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin.
        We believe that the investment, mortality and gross margins are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. These margins should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business. Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins. Investment margin, mortality margin and gross margin are reconciled to Allstate Financial GAAP net income in the following tables.
(1)
Net investment income includes periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, pretax, totaling $6 million for the first quarter of 2004 and $3 million for the first quarter of 2003.
(2)
Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from life and annuity premiums and contract charges and interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin. Amortization of DSI totaled $14 million in the first quarter of 2004. Prior periods have not been restated.
Operating Measures
        We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measures. Our method of calculating these measures may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
        
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period. Premiums earned is a GAAP measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The following table presents a reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned.
        
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales. It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.
        The following table illustrates where premiums and deposits are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
(1)
Life and annuity contract charges in the amount of est. $250 million and $227 million for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are also revenues recognized for GAAP, have been excluded from the table above, but are a component of the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item life and annuity premiums and contract charges.
        
New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies
is an operating measure that we use to quantify the current year sales of financial products by the Allstate proprietary distribution channel. New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies includes annual premiums on new insurance policies, initial premiums and deposits on annuities, net new deposits in the Allstate Bank, sales of other companies' mutual funds, and excludes renewal premiums. New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies for the three months ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 totaled est. $491 million and $361 million, respectively.
        This press release contains forward-looking statements about our operating income for 2004. These statements are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons. Weighted average rate changes and the annual impact of rate changes on premiums written in our Property-Liability business may be lower than projected due to a decrease in PIF. Loss costs in our Property-Liability business, including losses due to catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes, may exceed management's projections. In addition, claim frequency could be higher than expected. Lower interest rates and equity market returns could increase DAC amortization, reduce contract charges, investment margins and the profitability of the Allstate Financial segment. We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements. This press release contains unaudited financial information.
