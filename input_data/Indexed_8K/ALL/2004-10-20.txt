Exhibit 99
 
 
For Immediate Release
 
 
NORTHBROOK, Ill., October 20, 2004  The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported for the third quarter of 2004:
 
 
 
 
Property-Liability premiums written(1) grew 5.0% over the third quarter of 2003, driven largely by an increase in policies in force. Growth in policies in force for the core Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners lines accelerated to 5.4% and 6.2%, respectively, from the third quarter of 2003 and total Allstate brand policies in force increased 3.6%.  Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums written increased 7.7% and 10.5%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 2003, and retention for these lines increased by 0.6 pts and 0.8 pts, with total premiums written growing 6.0% and 7.9%, respectively.
 - 
                 
 
Property-Liability underwriting loss(1) was $685 million compared to underwriting income of $255 million in the third quarter of 2003 due to higher catastrophes and prior year net unfavorable reserve re-estimates partially offset by increased premiums earned and continued favorable auto and homeowners loss frequencies excluding catastrophes.
 - 
                 
 
      Pre-tax catastrophe losses in the third quarter totaled $1.71 billion compared to $378 million in the third quarter of 2003.
 - 
 
Allstate Financial premiums and deposits(1) increased to $4.02 billion in the third quarter of 2004. Operating income(1) was $151 million, an increase of 11.9% over the third quarter of 2003.
 - 
                 
 
      Allstate's annual operating income per diluted share guidance(1) for 2004 (assuming the level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year) is in the range of $4.15 to $4.40, compared to the range announced on July 19 of $5.40 to $5.65. The reduction in guidance corresponds to the amount of catastrophe losses incurred in the third quarter that were greater than the expected average used in pricing.

Measures used in this release that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") and operating measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" section of this document.

"This has been an exceptionally difficult quarter, particularly for our customers who filed more than 205,000 claims for damage to their property from four very powerful, destructive hurricanes. Our hearts truly go out to those who have suffered and endured the havoc caused by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne," said Chairman, President and CEO Edward M. Liddy.
 
"While the losses sustained from catastrophes are the dominant factor discussed in this quarter's report, I also want our shareholders to know how very proud I am of the thousands of Allstate claim representatives, agents, and support staff that have rallied over the past few months to ensure that our policyholders were cared for in their time of need. We have managed through the storms quite well and while the work to help put people's lives back together is not yet done, we are making good progress. We will continue to work to let our policyholders know they are in Good Hands with Allstate.
 
"Last week we announced that the losses from the four hurricanes are estimated to be approximately $1.06 billion after-tax, net of recoveries from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. Despite catastrophe losses in the quarter that are nearly four times our expected average, our business and the execution of our strategy continues to be healthy and strong.
 
"For Allstate Protection, net written premium and earned premium were up 5.0 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively over the third quarter of last year. Our trend of solid growth in policies-in-force (PIF) also continued in the quarter. Overall Allstate brand PIF was up 3.6 percent over the third quarter of 2003 with more than one million policies added compared to prior year. Most of the growth in PIF is the result of very solid growth for Allstate brand standard auto, which grew 5.4 percent compared to the third quarter of 2003. Allstate brand homeowners also showed strong results in the quarter with PIF increasing 6.2 percent over the prior year quarter.
 
"Retention of auto and homeowners policies maintained the strong trends we have seen throughout the year and contributed to the good results we experienced in written and earned premium and growth in PIF. These good retention results are particularly encouraging given the increased marketing and advertising efforts we saw from some competitors.
 
"Auto and homeowners claim frequency trends excluding catastrophes in the quarter also continued their favorable pattern from previous quarters and as compared to the prior year quarter. Auto severities also continue to trend favorably.  And despite the heavy the catastrophe losses in the third quarter, the combined ratio for Allstate brand homeowners was 97.8 for the nine months ended September 2004.
 
"Allstate Financial results are encouraging. Operating income was up nearly 12 percent at $151 million compared to the third quarter of 2003. The improvement in operating income was primarily due to lower operating expenses and increased margins from higher assets under management. Premiums and deposits were more than $4 billion in the quarter as we achieved record premiums and deposits from our retail distribution channels.
 
"In the quarter, Allstate exclusive agencies generated $520 million in new sales of financial products(1), an increase of 20 percent as compared to the third quarter of 2003.
 
"Though it is still early in the execution of our strategy for Allstate Financial, these solid results are an early indication of the progress we are making.
 
"Overall, we are pleased with our underlying performance in the quarter. When tested by an unprecedented series of hurricanes, we fared well. Despite incurring more than $2 billion in catastrophe losses for the first nine months of 2004, we still grew operating income per diluted share by 10.3 percent compared to the nine months ended September 2003, which serves as evidence of our strong performance. We remain highly confident in our business strategy and execution capabilities."
Consolidated Highlights
 
 
Book value per diluted share increased 10.5% compared to September 30, 2003 and 4.4% compared to December 31, 2003.  Book value per diluted share excluding the net impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities increased 13.7% to $27.21 at September 30, 2004 compared to September 30, 2003, and 5.5% compared to December 31, 2003.
 - 
                 
Property-Liability Highlights
 
 
Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners policies in force (PIF) increased 5.4% and 6.2%, respectively, from September 30, 2003 levels compared to increases of 4.9% and 5.7%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004 over the second quarter of 2003.  Both standard auto and homeowners experienced growth in most states.
 - 
                 
 
Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners new business premiums written grew 7.7% and 10.5%, respectively, in the quarter. In addition to higher new business premiums written during the third quarter of 2004 compared to the prior year third quarter, the retention ratios for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners increased to 90.9 and 88.6, respectively, in the third quarter of 2004.
 - 
                 
 
Prior year net unfavorable reserve re-estimates totaled $84 million, resulting from a $314 million unfavorable re-estimate for Discontinued Lines and Coverages, partially offset by a $230 million favorable re-estimate for Allstate Protection.  The Allstate Protection net reserve re-estimates reflect lower actual claim severity trends than anticipated in previous estimates.  See the Discontinued Lines and Coverages section of this document for more details on the reserve re-estimate in that segment.

Allstate Financial Highlights
 
 
 - 
                 
Total investments as of September 30, 2004 increased 12.8% over year end due to strong sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements.
 
 - 
                 
The weighted average interest crediting rate on fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life products in force, excluding market value adjusted annuities, was approximately 50 basis points more than the underlying long-term guaranteed rates on these products for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.
 
 - 
                 
Operating income includes a $6 million increase in the third quarter of 2004 over the third quarter of 2003 due to lower net expenses related to the direct response distribution business. The disposition of the majority of this business reduced total revenues by $54 million, benefits by $34 million, operating costs and expenses by $19 million and amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) by $9 million.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages Reserves
 
The Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off.  Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment.  This segment is managed by a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification.  As part of its responsibilities, this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks, settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations.
 
 
Underwriting loss of $315 million in the third quarter was primarily related to a $247 million re-estimate of asbestos reserves and a related $61 million increase of the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables.  The underwriting loss in the first nine months of 2004 was primarily due to re-estimates of asbestos reserves and the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables.  The underwriting loss in the third quarter of 2003 and first nine months of 2003 was primarily due to re-estimates of asbestos reserves.
 
During the third quarter, we completed our annual comprehensive "ground up" review of reserves for the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.  This review employed established industry and actuarial best practices within the context of the legal, legislative and economic environment, and it was conducted in addition to quarterly assessments in which we review reserves to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require adjustments to reserves.  Reserve re-estimates are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined.
 
Our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions by quarter are shown in the following table.
 
During the first nine months of 2004, 50 direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims, and claims of 19 policyholders were closed, so the number of direct policyholders with active claims increased by 31.
 
Reserve additions for asbestos in the third quarter of 2004, totaling $247 million, and in the first nine months of 2004, totaling $463 million, were primarily for products-related coverage.  They were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims, and re-estimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions, as ceding companies (other insurance carriers) also experienced increased claim activity.  Increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported.  These trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry, which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage, ongoing litigation, potential congressional activity, and bankruptcy actions.  IBNR now represents 63% of total net asbestos reserves, 2 points higher than at December 31, 2003.  IBNR provides for estimated probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new direct active policyholders and ceding companies.
 
Our exposure to non-products-related losses represents approximately 5% of total asbestos case reserves.  We do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds' retentions associated with excess insurance programs, which are our principal direct insurance, and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded. We did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non-products-related loss exposure.
 
Our survival ratios, as updated above, are at levels we consider indicative of a strong asbestos reserve position.
 
To further limit our asbestos exposure, we have significant reinsurance, primarily to reduce our exposure to loss in our direct excess insurance business.  Our reinsurance recoverables are estimated to be approximately 39% of our gross estimated loss reserves.
 
To allow for potential uncollectible reinsurance related to the asbestos reserve increase, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was also increased by $61 million in the third quarter of 2004.  In the second quarter of 2004, the allowance was increased by $76 million, as we refined our bad debt allowance to provide a greater allowance for companies in run-off and/or those who have reorganized to limit or wall off their liabilities.  As of September 30, 2004, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is $229 million, or approximately 19% of total Discontinued Lines recoverables from reinsurers.
 
We believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment.
 
Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures.  Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income
is income before dividends on preferred securities and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, excluding:
 - 
     
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,
 - 
     
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), to the extent that they resulted from the recognition of realized capital gains and losses, and
 - 
     
(loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax.
 
Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income.
We use operating income to evaluate our results of operations and as an integral component for incentive compensation.  It reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses and (loss) gain on disposition of operations.  These items may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Moreover, we reclassify periodic settlements on non-hedge derivative instruments into operating income to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investment or product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) and by doing so, appropriately reflect trends in product performance.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance.  We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator.  Operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
 
The following tables reconcile operating income and net income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003.
 
For the three months ended September 30,
 
For the nine months ended September 30,
 
 
In this press release, we provide guidance on operating income per diluted share for 2004 (assuming a level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year).  A reconciliation of this measure to net income is not possible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of realized capital gains and losses including periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which can vary substantially from one period to another and may have a significant impact on net income.  Because a forecast of realized capital gains and losses is not possible, neither is a forecast of the effects of amortization of DAC and DSI on realized capital gains and losses nor income taxes.  The other reconciling items between operating income and net income on a forward-looking basis are (loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, after-tax, which we assume to be zero for the remainder of the year.
 
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income to net income is provided in the Segment Results table.
Underwriting income (loss)
 
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of shareholders' equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12-month period, after excluding the after-tax effect of unrealized net capital gains. We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on equity. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period:  the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Return on equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  The following table shows the two computations.
Operating income return on equity
 
 
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing (a) shareholders' equity after excluding the net impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities and related DAC and life insurance reserves by (b) total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable GAAP ratio.
Book value per diluted share excluding the net impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities
 
We use the trend in Book value per diluted share excluding unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities in conjunction with Book value per diluted share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that Book value per diluted share excluding unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per diluted share excluding unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities should not be considered as a substitute for Book value per diluted share and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  The following table shows the two computations:
 
represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges and net investment income, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds.  We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financial's life insurance and financial product portfolio.  Additionally, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest-sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin.  Gross margin is comprised of four components that are utilized to further analyze the business; they include the investment margin, benefit margin, and maintenance and surrender charges.  We believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.  Gross margin, investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business.  Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins.  Gross margin is reconciled to Allstate Financial's GAAP net income in the following tables.
Gross margin
 
(1) Net investment income includes periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, pretax, totaling $15 million for the third quarter of 2004, $10 million for the third quarter of 2003, $33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.
eginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin.  Amortization of DSI totaled $4 million in the third quarter of 2004 and $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.  Prior periods have not been restated.
(2) B
 
is a component of gross margin.  Investment margin represents the excess of net investment income over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in Allstate Financial's reserve for life-contingent contract benefits.  We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and the amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period.
Investment margin
 
is a component of gross margin.  Benefit margin represents life and life contingent immediate annuity premiums and cost of insurance contract charges less contract benefits excluding the implied interest on life-contingent immediate annuities, which is included in the calculation of investment margin.  We use benefit margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's underwriting performance, as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period.
Benefit margin
The components of gross margin are reconciled to the corresponding financial statement line items in the following tables.
 
 
(1) Net investment income includes periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, pretax, totaling $15 million for the third quarter of 2004 and $10 million for the third quarter of 2003.
Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin.  Amortization of DSI totaled $4 million in the third quarter of 2004.  Prior periods have not been restated.

(1) Net investment income includes periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, pretax, totaling $33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and $15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.
Beginning in 2004, amortization of DSI is excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin.  Amortization of DSI totaled $25 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.  Prior periods have not been restated.

Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measures.  Our method of calculating these measures may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the following table.
Premiums written
 
 
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales.  It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.
 
The following table illustrates where premiums and deposits are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
(1) Life and annuity contract charges in the amount of est. $261 million and $229 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and est. $763 million and $692 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are also revenues recognized for GAAP, have been excluded from the table above, but are a component of the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item life and annuity premiums and contract charges.
 
is an operating measure that we use to quantify the current year sales of financial products by the Allstate proprietary distribution channel.  New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies includes annual premiums on new insurance policies, initial premiums and deposits on annuities, net new deposits in the Allstate Bank, sales of other companies' mutual funds, and excludes renewal premiums.  New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies for the three months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled est. $520 million and $435 million, respectively.  New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 totaled est. $1.53 billion and $1.22 billion, respectively.
New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies
 
This press release contains an estimate of The Allstate Corporation's losses resulting from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne and an estimate of our annual operating income for 2004.  These estimates are forward-looking statements based on management's current estimates, assumptions and projections and they are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
 
With respect to the hurricane loss estimate, actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including the following:
 - 
                 
Most significantly, the reporting and evaluation of these hurricane losses has been complicated by the following facts:
 - 
                 
These storms occurred over a short period of time;
 - 
                 
Some communities were hit by more than one hurricane; and
 - 
                 
Property damage resulted from both flooding, which Allstate policies do not cover, and high winds, which Allstate policies typically do cover.
 - 
                 
Because the extent of damage is particularly difficult to assess in the initial stages of repairing residential property, our loss estimate may not accurately represent the extent of loss.
 - 
                 
Because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by the hurricanes, our loss estimate may not accurately reflect the costs of repair.
 - 
                 
The loss estimate could be affected by the amount of FHCF reimbursements actually received.
 
With respect to the 2004 annual operating income estimate, actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including the following:
