The Allstate Corporation Receives Request For Information From Connecticut
Northbrook, Ill., Oct. 28, 2004  The Allstate Corporation today confirmed that it received on Oct. 25, 2004, interrogatories and a subpoena from the office of the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut seeking information relevant to that office's investigation into the possible violation of anti trust laws by unnamed parties.  In particular, the Attorney General's office indicated that it was investigating whether any person engaged in activities for the purpose of price fixing, market allocation, or bid rigging.  Published press reports have indicated that the Attorney General's office has issued requests of this nature to some 35 insurance companies and that some insurers have received, or may in the future receive, similar requests for information from other states or other regulatory authorities.
