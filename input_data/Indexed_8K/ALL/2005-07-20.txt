Exhibit 99
For Immediate Release
 
NORTHBROOK, Ill., July 20, 2005  The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported for the second quarter of 2005:
 
 
Property-Liability premiums written(1) grew 3.7% over the second quarter of 2004, driven by an increase in Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners premiums written, which grew 5.3% and 8.1%, respectively.  Premiums written grew 4.5% adjusted for the cost of excess catastrophe reinsurance programs and business ceded to Universal Insurance Company of North America ("Universal").  Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners policies in force ("PIF") increased 4.2% and 5.4%, respectively, from June 30, 2004 levels.
 - 
                 
 
Property-Liability underwriting income(1) increased 11.9% over the second quarter of 2004 to $994 million, due to increased premiums earned, continued favorable auto and homeowners loss frequencies, lower catastrophes and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, partially offset by an accrual for the anticipated settlement of a worker classification lawsuit.
 - 
                 
 
Pre-tax catastrophe losses totaled $146 million in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $248 million in the second quarter of 2004.  The effect of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio was 2.2 points in the second quarter of 2005 compared to 3.8 points in the second quarter of 2004.  The effect of catastrophes on net income per diluted share was $0.14 in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $0.23 in the second quarter of 2004.  Catastrophe losses in the second quarter of 2005 include an accrual of $43 million ($28 million after-tax and $0.04 per diluted share) for anticipated assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("Citizens") in the state of Florida.  This assessment is expected to be partially recovered through premiums written in the state later this year and into 2006. The Citizens assessment along with the accrual for the anticipated settlement of a worker classification lawsuit impacted the combined ratio by 2.4 pts in the second quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Allstate Financial operating income for the quarter was $137 million, an increase of 8.7% over the second quarter of 2004.  Premiums and deposits(1) were $4.03 billion, a decrease of 5.9% over the second quarter of 2004.

per diluted share guidance
(assuming the level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year) is in the range of $6.00 to $6.40, compared to the previously announced range of $5.40 to $5.80.
 
(1) Measures used in this release that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and operating measures are defined in the "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" section of this document.
"Allstate has turned in another very strong quarterly performance," said Edward M. Liddy, chairman and CEO of The Allstate Corporation. "We continued to generate profitable growth accompanied by attractive returns on equity while, at the same time, continuing our disciplined capital management activities.  Solid growth in book value per share is a good indicator of the value we are creating for our shareholders.
 
"Our property-liability business earned an impressive $994 million in underwriting income, which is an 11.9% increase over the second quarter of 2004.  A relatively mild quarter for catastrophe losses and a continuation of favorable frequencies for auto and homeowners helped generate this outstanding result.
 
"We are pleased with the growth in net premiums written for Allstate Protection in the quarter, particularly given the catastrophe risk management strategies we implemented in a few key markets and the substantial reinsurance purchases we made in the quarter.  Premiums written were up 3.8% compared to the second quarter of 2004 with Allstate brand standard auto and homeowner premiums written serving as the key drivers increasing 5.3% and 8.1%, respectively, over the prior year quarter.  In a climate of relatively stable pricing and a more competitive marketplace, we believe this is a good result.
 
Total policies in force for Allstate brand personal lines grew 3.4% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2004.  Policies in force for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners grew 4.2% and 5.4%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2004.
 
"Our retention ratio for Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners remains strong at 90.8 and 88.3, respectively, compared to 91.0 and 88.2 in the second quarter of 2004.  We also continued our rollout of Allstate Your Choice Auto Insurance, an innovative new auto insurance product, which provides even more choice for auto insurance customers.  This product is now available in a total of nine states after six new states came online in the second quarter of 2005 and we are on target for the product to be in a majority of the country by the end of 2005.
 
"Our rollout of SRM IV, the company's newest generation underwriting and pricing process for auto insurance, remains on track to be in a majority of states before the end of the year. As evidenced by our results, tiered pricing allows us to segment risks with even more sophistication while helping us achieve the profitable growth we seek.
 
"Allstate Financial turned in an improved performance for the quarter.  Operating income of $137 million was 8.7% over the second quarter of 2004, driven by lower expenses and investment margin growth.  Premiums and deposits of $4.0 billion decreased 5.9% from the prior year due to reduced institutional product sales and market interest rates decreasing the competitiveness of fixed annuities.  Allstate Financial's primary focus is improving returns and then profitably growing the business in those product lines and distribution channels where acceptable returns can be achieved.
 
"The challenging interest rate climate has consumers considering alternative savings vehicles such as money market funds and short- and medium-term CDs because they have become more competitive with fixed annuities.  If this continues, we expect the fixed annuity market to contract in the near term.  With Allstate Financial remaining disciplined in pricing to meet our return objectives, fixed annuity sales may decline temporarily until the interest rate environment improves.
 
"We continued to make significant progress on our share repurchase program in the quarter, buying back 14.0 million shares at $796 million.  For the first half of the year, we have bought back a total of 27.4 million shares at $1.5 billion toward the current $4.0 billion share repurchase program.
 
"Our new leadership structure, with Tom Wilson as president and chief operating officer, responsible for all insurance operations, is off to a great start. Finally, our performance for the first half of 2005 was excellent and I remain confident about our prospects for the future. Thus, we have raised our annual operating income earnings per diluted share guidance for 2005 to a range of $6.00 to $6.40."
Consolidated Highlights
 
 
Book value per diluted share increased 13.3% compared to June 30, 2004.  Book value per diluted share excluding the net impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities(1) was $30.40 at June 30, 2005, reflecting increases of 9.6% and 6.2% compared to June 30, 2004 and December 31, 2004, respectively.
 - 
                 
Property-Liability Highlights
 
 
Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners PIF increased 4.2% and 5.4%, respectively, from June 30, 2004 levels, compared to increases of 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2005 over the first quarter of 2004.  PIF results in this release exclude impacts from Allstate Canada.
 - 
                 
 
The retention ratio for the Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners was 90.8 and 88.3, respectively, compared to 91.0 and 88.2 in the prior year second quarter.  Retention ratios in this release exclude impacts of Allstate Canada.
 - 
                 
 
New business premiums for the Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners declined 1.7% and 9.6%, respectively, as compared to the second quarter of 2004, primarily due to declines in certain markets from proactive risk management actions and competitive pressures.
 - 
                 
 
Standard auto new business premiums grew 2.1% excluding New Jersey and Florida.  In New Jersey, we continue to experience a decline due to new entrants in the market.  In Florida, we continue to experience a decline due to decreased cross-selling opportunities from our homeowners business.  New business premiums, which represented 9.0% of the total standard auto premiums written, increased in approximately 60% of the states.
 - 
                 
 
Homeowners new business premiums grew 3.0% excluding Florida, California and New York.  Declines in these markets are due to our catastrophe risk management strategies.  New business premiums, which represented 12.8% of the total homeowners premiums written, increased in approximately 70% of the states.
 - 
                 
 
We will continue our disciplined risk and pricing approach, seeking profitable growth on a market-by-market basis.
Two new homeowners reinsurance programs related to our risk management strategies commenced during the second quarter of 2005, impacting premiums written.
 - 
                 
 
We entered into multi-year reinsurance treaties, effective June 1, 2005, that cover excess catastrophe losses in 7 states, including Florida, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina.  The cost of these treaties is approximately $190 million per year, or $48 million per quarter.  The previous treaties had a quarterly impact on premiums written of $23 million.  The second quarter impact of these treaties on premiums written was $30 million and $5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 - 
                 
 
We also reached a definitive agreement for a portion of our existing Allstate Floridian customers to have new policies available from Universal when their existing policies expire and are not renewed.  This program includes approximately 95,000 policyholders, or approximately 1% of Allstate brand homeowners PIF.  We are also ceding premiums and losses on these policies during the period beginning March 1, 2005 to their expiration date.  The impact of this agreement on the second quarter premiums written was $24 million.  PIF is expected to be adversely impacted beginning in the third quarter of 2005 and during 2006.
 - 
                 
 
Our risk management strategies have decreased our catastrophic risk in the state of Florida, including our expected per storm retention from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund.  For the current year, our expected retention for qualifying personal property losses per storm is an estimated $233 million for the two largest hurricanes and $78 million for other hurricanes.  This compares to our per storm retention of $312 million during the prior year.  We continue to consider other enterprise risk management actions including the expanded use of alternative markets and the acquisition of additional reinsurance to cover our major catastrophe risks such as hurricanes and earthquakes, including assessments from the California Earthquake Authority.
 
Because Hurricane Dennis, which struck portions of Florida and the gulf coast beginning on July 10, has only recently occurred, its impact on the company and its subsidiaries cannot be fully determined at this time.

Allstate Financial Highlights
 
 
 - 
                 
Investments including Separate Account assets as of June 30, 2005 increased 13.6% over June 30, 2004 primarily due to sales of fixed annuities and funding agreements.
 
 - 
                 
As of June 30, 2005, 75% of our interest-sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities, have a guaranteed crediting rate of 3% or higher.  Of these contracts, 76% have crediting rates that are at the minimum as of June 30, 2005.  For all interest-sensitive life and fixed annuity contracts, excluding market value adjusted annuities, the approximate difference between the weighted average crediting rate and the average guaranteed crediting rate is 49 basis points as of June 30, 2005 compared to 51 basis points as of March 31, 2005.
 
 - 
                 
New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies increased 13.5% over the second quarter of 2004 to $588 million.
 
 - 
                 
Variable annuity premiums and deposits were $459 million in the quarter, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year and 13.6% over the first quarter of this year.  Recent enhancements to the underlying investment funds, the guaranteed accumulation benefit, the new guaranteed withdrawal benefit and our new marketing approach are beginning to have a positive impact.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures.  Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income
is income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, after-tax, excluding:
 
 - 
     
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,
 
 - 
     
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses,
 
 - 
     
(loss) gain on disposition of operations, after-tax, and
 
 - 
     
adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.
 
Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income.
 
We use operating income to evaluate our results of operations.  It reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, (loss) gain on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses and (loss) gain on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and economic developments such as market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Moreover, we reclassify periodic settlements on non-hedge derivative instruments into operating income to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, replicated assets or product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) and by doing so, appropriately reflect trends in product performance.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our performance.  We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator.  We use adjusted measures of operating income and operating income per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
The following table reconciles operating income and net income for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004.
 
 
 
In this press release, we provide guidance on operating income per diluted share for 2005 (assuming a level of average expected catastrophe losses used in pricing for the remainder of the year).  A reconciliation of this measure to net income is not possible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of realized capital gains and losses including periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which can vary substantially from one period to another and may have a significant impact on net income.  Because a forecast of realized capital gains and losses is not possible, neither is a forecast of the effects of amortization of DAC and DSI on realized capital gains and losses nor income taxes.  The other reconciling items between operating income and net income on a forward-looking
basis are a non-recurring increase in liability for future benefits, after-tax, loss on disposition of operations, after-tax, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle, after-tax, which we assume to be zero for the remainder of the year.
 
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income to net income is provided in the Segment Results table.
Underwriting income (loss)
 
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of shareholders' equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12-month period, after excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains. We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on equity. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and that are driven by economic developments, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management:  the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized capital gains and losses and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, and non-recurring items that are not indicative of our business or economic trends. Return on equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  The following table shows the reconciliation.
Operating income return on equity
 
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the net impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities and related DAC and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable GAAP ratio.
Book value per diluted share excluding the net impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities
 
We use the trend in book value per diluted share excluding unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities in conjunction with book value per diluted share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per diluted share excluding unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per diluted share excluding unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities should not be considered as a substitute for book value per diluted share and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  The following table shows the reconciliation.
 
represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges and net investment income, less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds.  We use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of Allstate Financial's life insurance and financial product portfolio.  Additionally, for many of our products, including fixed annuities, variable life and annuities, and interest-sensitive life insurance, the amortization of DAC and DSI is determined based on actual and expected gross margin.  Gross margin is comprised of three components that are utilized to further analyze the business; they include the investment margin, benefit margin, and contract charges and fees.  We believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.  Gross margin, investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business.  Net income is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to these margins.  Gross margin is reconciled to Allstate Financial's GAAP net income in the following table.
Gross margin

Amortization of DSI was excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin.  Amortization of DSI totaled $15 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $54 million for the first six months of 2005 compared to $7 million in the second quarter of 2004 and $21 million in the first six months of 2004.
 
is a component of gross margin.  Investment margin represents the excess of net investment income over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in Allstate Financial's reserve for life-contingent contract benefits.  We use investment margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's profitability related to the difference between investment returns on assets supporting certain products and the amounts credited to customers ("spread") during a fiscal period.
Investment margin
 
is a component of gross margin.  Benefit margin represents life and life-contingent immediate annuity premiums, cost of insurance contract charges and variable annuity fees for contract guarantees less contract benefits.  Benefit margin excludes the implied interest on life-contingent immediate annuities, which is included in the calculation of investment margin.  We use benefit margin to evaluate Allstate Financial's underwriting performance, as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period.
Benefit margin
The components of gross margin are reconciled to the corresponding financial statement line items in the following tables.
 
 
Amortization of DSI was excluded from interest credited to contractholder funds for purposes of calculating gross margin.  Amortization of DSI totaled $15 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $7 million in the second quarter of 2004.

Prior periods have been restated to conform to current period presentations.  In connection therewith, fees related to guaranteed minimum death, accumulation, withdrawal and income benefits on variable annuities have been reclassified to benefit margin from maintenance charges.  Additionally, amounts previously presented as maintenance charges and surrender charges are now presented in the aggregate as contract charges and fees.  Further, the Allstate Workplace Division margins were conformed.  These reclassifications did not result in a change in gross margin.

Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measures.  Our method of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the following table.
Premiums written
 
 
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales.  It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.
 
The following table illustrates where premiums and deposits are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

Life and annuity contract charges in the amount of est. $277 million and $252 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and est. $549 million and $502 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are also revenues recognized for GAAP, have been excluded from the table above, but are a component of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations line item life and annuity premiums and contract charges.
 
New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies
is an operating measure that we use to quantify the current year sales of financial products by the Allstate Agency proprietary distribution channel.  New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies includes annual premiums on new insurance policies, initial premiums and deposits on annuities, net new deposits in the Allstate Bank, sales of other companies' mutual funds, and excludes renewal premiums.  New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies for the second quarter of 2005 and second quarter of 2004 totaled est. $588 million and $518 million, respectively.  New sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 totaled est. $1.10 billion and $1.01 billion, respectively.
 
Forward Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements about our operating income for 2005.  These statements are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections.  Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons:
 
Actual levels of PIF may be lower than projected if we are not able to maintain our expected retention levels and new business levels due to competitive pressures.
 - 
                 
Loss costs in our Property-Liability business, including losses due to catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes, may exceed management's projections.  In particular, losses due to catastrophes may exceed the average expected level used in pricing.
 - 
                 
 
If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of rate increases in a timely manner and at adequate levels to cover reinsurance costs, we may refrain from writing new homeowners policies or non-renew homeowners policies in certain markets.  In turn, such steps could possibly lead to a decline in standard auto PIF.
 - 
                 
 
Claim frequency could be higher than expected.
 - 
                 
 
Lower than projected interest rates and equity market returns could decrease consolidated net investment income, increase DAC amortization, reduce contract charges, investment margins and the profitability of the Allstate Financial segment.
 - 
                 
 
Higher than projected interest rates could increase surrenders and withdrawals, increase DAC amortization and reduce the competitive position and profitability of the Allstate Financial segment.
 - 
                 
 
Results from the management and review of our portfolios could cause lower than expected net investment income.
 - 
                 
 
This press release contains unaudited financial information.
We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements.  Our estimate of average expected catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year includes expected losses from Hurricane Dennis.
