Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
(a)
                                 
On July 26, 2005, the Compensation and Succession Committee of the Board of Directors of the registrant approved the annual cash incentive award opportunity for Thomas J. Wilson for the portion of 2005 during which he is serving in his new position as President and Chief Operating Officer:
 
(i)
                                    
50% based on the two equally-weighted performance goals that apply to executive officers in corporate functions: 
an adjusted operating income per diluted share measure and combined business unit results; and
 
(ii)
                                 
50% based on
the five performance goals that apply to Allstate Protection executive officers: 
50% based on a matrix that measures the results of premium growth, policy growth and combined ratio; 15% based on a matrix measuring sales of Allstate Financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies; 10% based on expense ratio reduction; 15% based on a measure of customer loyalty that
is a relative ranking compared to a peer group of companies
; and 10% based on the corporate adjusted operating income per diluted share measure
 
The award will be paid under the registrant's Annual Covered Employee Incentive Compensation Plan, which governs
awards to those executive officers who are considered "covered employees" as defined in Section 162(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,
or under the registrant's Annual Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, which governs awards to
all other executive officers.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
