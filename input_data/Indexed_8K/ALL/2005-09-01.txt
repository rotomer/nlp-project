Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On August 30, 2005, Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC"), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of The Allstate Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a Class Action Settlement Agreement (the "Agreement") providing for the settlement of a certified class action lawsuit entitled , pending in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (the "Court").  Previously disclosed in the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, this litigation challenged the overtime exemption claimed by AIC under California wage and hour laws.  The Company continues to deny any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the claims raised in the lawsuit.
William Sekly, et. al., v. Allstate Insurance Company
 
Under the Agreement, AIC is obligated to pay no more than $120 million.  This payment is "all inclusive," including, but not limited to, unpaid overtime pay, pay for meal and rest break violations, any and all associated penalties, interest, employer tax contributions, costs, attorneys' fees, class administration costs, referee costs, and incentive payments to the named plaintiffs.  The settlement proceeds are to be paid to class members, in exchange for a release, as described in the Agreement.  The class is comprised of all persons who, between November 27, 1996 and December 31, 2004, were employed by AIC in California as claims adjusters or in similar positions as described in the Agreement.  In the second quarter of 2005, as previously disclosed, the Company established a $120 million reserve for the potential settlement of this matter.
 
The Agreement is contingent upon various conditions, including, but not limited to, preliminary approval by the Court and final approval by the Court after notice to the class and a hearing.  There can be no assurance that the Agreement will be approved by the Court nor upheld if challenged on appeal.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
