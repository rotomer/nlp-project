Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Item 1.01.
        
Director Compensation
On September 10, 2006, the Registrant's Board of Directors increased the annual fees for non-employee directors who serve as chairs of committees of the Board from $10,000 to $15,000, effective June 1, 2007, but made no other changes to non-employee director compensation.  A summary of non-employee director compensation is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.
Equity Plans
On September 10, 2006, the Board approved the amendment and restatement of the Registrant's:  (1) Amended and Restated 2001 Equity Incentive Plan; (2) 2006 Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors; (3) Equity Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors; and (4) Equity Incentive Plan, (collectively "Plans").  Existing provisions in the Plans regarding anti-dilution adjustments of awards were revised to make them more clearly mandatory in instances of equity restructurings, such as stock splits.  The Plans were amended to reflect recent interpretations of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) ("FAS 123R").  Under the recent interpretations, FAS 123R could result in the triggering of possibly significant compensation costs for companies that adjust terms of equity awards to preserve award value after an equity restructuring event unless the equity awards contain mandatory anti-dilution provisions. At the same time, FAS 123R permits the Plans to be amended in order to add a mandatory anti-dilution provision or modify an existing anti-dilution provision without incurring compensation costs so long as the amendment is not made in contemplation of an equity restructuring event. The Board decided to amend the Plans now and revise the anti-dilution provisions to make them more clearly mandatory while the Registrant is not contemplating any such equity restructuring event.  Copies of the amended and restated Plans are attached as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 to this report.
Section 5  Corporate Governance and Management
Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.

Shares of Stock that are potentially deliverable under an Award that expires or is cancelled, forfeited, settled in cash or otherwise settled without delivery of shares of Stock shall not be treated as having been issued under the Plan.  With respect to an SAR that is settled in Stock, the full number of shares underlying the exercised portion of the SAR shall be treated as having been issued under the Plan, regardless of the number of shares used to settle the SAR upon exercise.  Shares of Stock that are tendered or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to an Award or to satisfy the Option Exercise Price related to an Option or other Award shall be deemed to be shares of Stock issued under the Plan.  If, before June 30, 2003, the Option Exercise Price is satisfied by tendering Stock, only the number of shares issued net of the shares tendered shall be deemed issued under the Plan.

In the event of any other change in corporate capitalization, such as a merger, consolidation, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section 368 of the Code) or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, such equitable adjustments described in the foregoing sentence shall be made as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights.  In either case, any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) each such adjustment with respect to an Incentive Stock Option shall comply with the rules of Section 424(a) of the Code and (ii) in no event shall any adjustment be made which would render any Incentive Stock Option granted hereunder to be other than an incentive stock option for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.

In the event an Option is transferred as contemplated herein, any Reload Options associated with such transferred Option shall terminate, and such transferred Option may not be subsequently transferred by the transferee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Otherwise, a transferred Option shall continue to be governed by and subject to the terms and limitations of the Plan and the relevant Award Agreement, and the transferee shall be entitled to the same rights as the Participant, as if no transfer had taken place.

When payment of the Option Price is made by tender of Stock, the difference, if any, between the aggregate Option Price payable with respect to the option being exercised and the Fair Market Value of the share(s) of Stock tendered in payment (plus any applicable taxes) shall be paid by check.  No Grantee may tender shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value exceeding the aggregate Option Price payable with respect to the Option being exercised
In the event a Grantee elects to pay the Option Price payable with respect to an option pursuant to clause (v) above, (A) only a whole number of share(s) of Stock (and not fractional shares of Stock) may be withheld in payment and (B) such Grantee must present evidence acceptable to the Company that he or she has owned a number of shares of Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Stock to be withheld in payment of the Option Price (and that such owned shares of Stock have not been subject to any substantial risk of forfeiture) for at least six months prior to the date of exercise.  When payment of the Option Price is made by the withholding of shares of Stock, the difference, if any, between the aggregate Option Price payable with respect to the option being exercised and the Fair Market Value of the share(s) of Stock withheld in payment (plus any applicable taxes) shall be paid by check.  No Grantee may authorize the withholding of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value exceeding the aggregate Option Price payable with respect to the option being exercised.  Any withheld shares of Stock shall no longer be issuable under such option.
12
 
If restricted Stock ("Tendered Restricted Stock") is used to pay the Option Price for Stock, then a number of shares of Stock acquired on exercise of the option equal to the number of shares of Tendered Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Tendered Restricted Stock, determined as of the date of exercise of the option.  If the Option Price for restricted Stock is paid with Tendered Restricted Stock, and if the Committee determines that the restricted Stock acquired on exercise of the option is subject to restrictions ("Greater Restrictions") that cause it to have a greater risk of forfeiture than the Tendered Restricted Stock, then notwithstanding the preceding sentence, all the restricted Stock acquired on exercise of the option shall be subject to such Greater Restrictions.
Shares of unrestricted Stock acquired by a Grantee on exercise of an option shall be delivered to the Grantee or, at the request of the Grantee, shall be credited directly to a brokerage account specified by the Grantee.
(b)           .   Subject to Article 15, no option shall be exercisable by a Section 16 Grantee during the first six months after its Grant Date, if such exercise (or the sale of shares received upon exercise)  would result in the loss of an exemption for a grant under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act.
Special Rules for Section 16 Grantees
(c)           .   No shares of Stock shall be issued hereunder upon option exercise except shares of Stock available under Article 3(a). 
Permissible Shares Issued
Each Grantee, by acceptance of an award, waives all rights to specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief and acknowledges that he has an adequate remedy at law in the form of damages.
9.              .   The Committee may, in its discretion:
Loans and Guarantees
(a)           allow a Grantee to defer payment to the Company of all or any portion of (i) the Option Price of an option, (ii) the purchase price of a share of restricted Stock, or (iii) any taxes associated with a benefit hereunder which is not a cash benefit at the time such benefit is so taxable, or
(b)           cause the Company to guarantee a loan from a third party to the Grantee, in an amount equal to all or any portion of such Option Price, purchase price, or any related taxes.
Any such payment deferral or guarantee by the Company pursuant to this Article 9 shall be, on a secured or unsecured basis, for such periods, at such interest rates, and on such other terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Grantee shall not be entitled to defer the payment of such Option Price, purchase price, or any related taxes unless the Grantee (i) enters into a binding obligation to pay the deferred amount and (ii) except with respect to treasury shares, pays upon exercise of an option or grant of shares of restricted Stock, as the case may be, an amount equal to or greater than the aggregate Minimum Consideration
13
 
therefor.  If the Committee has permitted a payment deferral or caused the Company to guarantee a loan pursuant to this Article 9, then the Committee may, in its discretion, require the immediate payment of such deferred amount or the immediate release of such guarantee upon the Grantee's Termination of Employment or if the Grantee sells or otherwise transfers the Grantee's shares of Stock purchased pursuant to such deferral or guarantee.
10.           .   The Committee may, on the Grant Date or any later date, prohibit a Grantee from making the election described below.  If the Committee has not prohibited such Grantee from making such election, and the Grantee shall, in connection with the exercise of any option, or the grant of any share of restricted Stock, make the election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (i.e., an election to include in such Grantee's gross income in the year of transfer the amounts specified in Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), such Grantee shall notify the Company of such election within 10 days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service, in addition to any filing and notification required pursuant to regulations issued under the authority of Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Mandatory Withholding Taxes
(a)           Whenever under the Plan, cash or shares of Stock are to be delivered upon exercise or payment of an Award or upon a share of restricted Stock becoming nonforfeitable, or any other event with respect to rights and benefits hereunder, the Company shall be entitled to require as a condition of delivery (i) that the Grantee remit an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, and local withholding tax requirements related thereto, (ii) the withholding of such sums from compensation otherwise due to the Grantee or from any shares of Stock due to the Grantee under the Plan or (iii) any combination of the foregoing.
(b)           If any disqualifying disposition described in Article 6(c)(vi) is made with respect to shares of Stock acquired under an incentive stock option granted pursuant to the Plan or any election described in Article 10 is made, then the person making such disqualifying disposition or election shall remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy all federal, state, and local withholding taxes thereby incurred; provided that, in lieu of or in addition to the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to withhold such sums from compensation otherwise due to the Grantee or from any shares of Stock due to the Grantee under the Plan.
12.            .
Elective Share Withholding
(a)           Subject to the prior approval of the Committee and to Article 12(b), a Grantee may elect the withholding ("Share Withholding") by the Company of a portion of the shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to such Grantee upon the exercise or payment of an Award or upon a share of restricted Stock's becoming nonforfeitable (each a "Taxable Event") having a Fair Market Value equal to
14
 
(i)            the minimum amount necessary to satisfy required federal, state, or local withholding tax liability attributable to the Taxable Event; or
(ii)           with the Committee's prior approval, a greater amount, not to exceed the estimated total amount of such Grantee's tax liability with respect to the Taxable Event.
(b)           Each Share Withholding election by a Grantee shall be subject to the following restrictions:
(i)            any Grantee's election shall be subject to the Committee's right to revoke its approval of Share Withholding by such Grantee at any time before the Grantee's election if the Committee has reserved the right to do so at the time of its approval;
(ii)           if the Grantee is a Section 16 Grantee, such Grantee's election shall be subject to the disapproval of the Committee at any time, whether or not the Committee has reserved the right to do so; and
(iii)          the Grantee's election must be made before the date (the "Tax Date") on which the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
13.            .
Termination of Employment
(a)           .   Except as otherwise provided by the Committee on or after the Grant Date, a Grantee's shares of restricted Stock that are forfeitable shall be forfeited upon the Grantee's Termination of Employment.
Restricted Stock
(b)           .   If a Grantee has a Termination of Employment, then, unless otherwise provided in the Grant Agreement, any unexercised option to the extent exercisable on the date of the Grantee's Termination of Employment may be exercised by the Grantee, in whole or in part, at any time within three months following such Termination of Employment, except that
Other Awards
(i)            if the Grantee's Termination of Employment is on account of Disability, then any unexercised option to the extent exercisable at the date of such Termination of Employment, may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the Grantee at any time within two years after the date of such Termination of Employment; and
(ii)           if the Grantee's Termination of Employment is on account of Retirement, then any unexercised option to the extent exercisable at the date of such Termination of Employment, may be exercised, in whole or in part, by the Grantee at any time within five years after the date of such Termination of Employment; and
(iii)          if the Grantee's Termination of Employment is caused by the death of
15
 
the Grantee or if the Grantee's death occurs during the period following Termination of Employment during which the option would be exercisable under the preceding clause of Article 13(b) or under Article 13(b)(i) or (ii), then any unexercised option to the extent exercisable on the date of the Grantee's death, may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time within two years after the Grantee's death by the Grantee's personal representative or by the person to whom the option is transferred by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
(c)           .   Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Award shall be exercisable beyond the maximum term permitted under the original Award Agreement unless the Committee explicitly extends such original term, in which case such term shall not be extended beyond the maximum term permitted by the Plan.
Maximum Extension
14.          .   The Committee may authorize any foreign Subsidiary to adopt a plan for granting Awards ("Foreign Equity Incentive Plan").  All awards granted under such Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall be treated as grants under the Plan.  Such Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall have such terms and provisions as the Committee permits not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan and which may be more restrictive than those contained in the Plan.  Awards granted under such Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall be governed by the terms of the Plan except to the extent that the provisions of the Foreign Equity Incentive Plans are more restrictive than the terms of the Plan, in which case such terms of the Foreign Equity Incentive Plans shall control.
Equity Incentive Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries
15.          .   The Committee may grant substitute awards for any cancelled Award granted under this Plan or any plan of any entity acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in accordance with this Article 15.  If the Committee cancels any Award (granted under this Plan, or any plan of any entity acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and a new Award is substituted therefor, then the Committee may, in its discretion, determine the terms and conditions of such new Award, and may provide that the Grant Date of the cancelled Award shall be the date used to determine the earliest date or dates for exercising the new substituted Award under Article 8 hereof so that the Grantee may exercise the substituted Award at the same time as if the Grantee had held the substituted Award since the Grant Date of the cancelled Award.
Substituted Awards
16.            .
Securities Law Matters
(a)           If the Committee deems necessary to comply with the Securities Act of 1933, the Committee may require a written investment intent representation by the Grantee and may require that a restrictive legend be affixed to certificates for shares of Stock.
(b)           If based upon the opinion of counsel for the Company, the Committee determines that the exercise or nonforfeitability of, or delivery of benefits pursuant to, any Award could violate any applicable provision of (i) federal or state securities law or regulations or (ii) the
16
 
listing requirements of any national securities exchange on which are listed any of the Company's equity securities, then the Committee may postpone any such exercise, nonforfeitability or delivery, as the case may be, but the Company shall use its best efforts to cause such exercise, nonforfeitability or delivery to comply with all such provisions at the earliest practicable date.
17.            .   Benefits payable under the Plan to any person shall be paid directly by the Company.  The Company shall not be required to fund, or otherwise segregate assets to be used for payment of, benefits under the Plan.
No Funding Required
18.           .   Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor the granting of any Award shall be construed to (a) give any Grantee the right to remain employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to any benefits not specifically provided by the Plan or (b) in any manner modify the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to modify, amend, or terminate any of its employee benefit plans.
No Employment Rights
19.            .   A Grantee shall not, by reason of any Award (other than restricted Stock) have any right as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Stock which may be deliverable upon exercise or payment of such Award until such shares have been delivered to him.  Shares of restricted Stock held by a Grantee or held in escrow by the Secretary of the Company shall confer on the Grantee all rights of a stockholder of the Company, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or the Award Agreement.  The Committee, in its discretion, at the time of grant of restricted Stock, may permit or require the payment of cash dividends thereon to be deferred and, if the Committee so determines, reinvested in additional restricted Stock to the extent shares are available under Article 3, or otherwise reinvested in Stock.  Stock dividends, deferred cash dividends and dividends in the form of property other than cash, issued with respect to restricted Stock shall, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, be treated as additional shares of restricted Stock that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms as apply to the shares with respect to which such dividends are issued.  The Committee may, in its discretion, provide for crediting and payment of interest on deferred cash dividends.
Rights as a Stockholder
20.            .   Any and all grants, payments of cash, or deliveries of shares of Stock hereunder shall constitute special incentive payments to the Grantee and shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of salary or compensation of the Grantee for the purposes of determining any pension, retirement, death or other benefits under (a) any pension, retirement, profit-sharing, bonus, life insurance or other employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) any agreement between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Grantee, on the other hand, except as such plan or agreement shall otherwise expressly provide.
Nature of Payments
21.            .   Neither the Committee's nor the Board's determinations under the Plan need be uniform and may be made by the Committee or the Board selectively among persons who receive, or are eligible to receive, Awards (whether or not such
Non-Uniform Determinations
17
 
persons are similarly situated).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee shall be entitled, among other things, to make non-uniform and selective determinations, to enter into non-uniform and selective Award Agreements as to (a) the identity of the Grantees, (b) the terms and provisions of Awards, and (c) the treatment, under Article 13, of Terminations of Employment.
22.            .    In the event of any equity restructuring (within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004)) that causes the per share value of shares of Stock to change, such as a stock dividend, stock split, spin off, rights offering, or recapitalization through a large, nonrecurring cash dividend, the Committee shall cause there to be made an equitable adjustment to (a) the number and kind of shares that may be awarded under the Plan, (b) the number of shares or Awards that may be granted to any individual under the Plan or that may be granted pursuant to any Articles or types of Awards and (iii) the number and kind of shares subject to and the exercise price (if applicable) of any then outstanding Awards.  In the event of any other change in corporate capitalization, such as a merger, consolidation, any reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition of such term in Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code) or any partial or complete liquidation of the Company, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, cause there to be made such equitable adjustment described in the foregoing sentence and/or the termination of an Award.  In either case, any such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
Adjustments
23.            .   The Board may from time to time in its discretion amend or modify the Plan without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, except as such stockholder approval may be required (a) to permit transactions in Stock pursuant to the Plan to be exempt from potential liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, (b) to permit the Company to deduct, in computing its income tax liability pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, compensation resulting from Awards, (c) to retain incentive stock option treatment under Section  422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or (d) under the listing requirements of any securities exchange on which are listed any of the Company's equity securities.
Amendment of the Plan
24.            .   The Plan shall terminate on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date or at such earlier time as the Board may determine.  Any termination, whether in whole or in part, shall not affect (a) any Award then outstanding under the Plan, or (b) the Company's ability to make adjustments to or cancel or continue Awards in accordance with Article 22.
Termination of the Plan
25.            .   The Plan and all Awards granted pursuant to it are subject to all laws and regulations of any governmental authority which may be applicable thereto; and notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Award, Grantees shall not be entitled to exercise Awards or receive the benefits thereof and the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Stock or pay any benefits to a Grantee if such exercise, delivery, receipt or payment of benefits would constitute a violation by the Grantee or the Company of any provision of any such law or regulation.
No Illegal Transactions
18
 
26.            .   The law of the State of Delaware except its law with respect to choice of law, shall be controlling in all matters relating to or arising out of the Plan or any Award.
Controlling Law
27.            .   If all or any part of the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not serve to invalidate any portion of the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid.  Any Article or part of an Article so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Article or part of an Article to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.
