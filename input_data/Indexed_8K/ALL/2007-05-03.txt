Item 8.01.  Other Events.
In 2006, as part of its investigation into Katrina-related claims, Congress authorized the Department of Homeland Security to investigate those insurers participating in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").  The Registrant has cooperated with the Department of Homeland Security in connection with this investigation.  In connection with its investigation, the Department of Homeland Security has informed the Registrant that Allstate Insurance Company ("AIC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, will be served with a subpoena for documents with respect to homeowners' claims arising from Katrina.
AIC sells and administers policies as a participant in the NFIP. Under the arrangement, the Federal Government is obligated to pay all claims.
