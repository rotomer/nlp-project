Item 1.01 and 1.02.  Entry into and Termination of Material Definitive Agreements.
On May 8, 2007, the Registrant, Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company (the "Borrowers") entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto, Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Syndication Agent; Bank of America, N.A. and Citibank, N.A., as Documentation Agents; Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, Merrill Lynch Bank USA, Morgan Stanley Bank and William Street Commitment Corporation, as Co-Agents; and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference) (the "Credit Agreement").  The Credit Agreement replaced a $1.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility dated June 4, 2004 among the Borrowers; the lenders party thereto; JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Syndication Agent; Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A. and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agents; and the Bank of New York, as Administrative Agent (the "2004 Credit Agreement").  The 2004 Credit Agreement was terminated on May 8, 2007.  The Registrant had the option to terminate the 2004 Credit Agreement early and no material termination penalties were incurred.
The Credit Agreement is a new $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial term of five years expiring in 2012 with two one year extensions that can be exercised in the first and second year of the facility upon approval of existing or replacement lenders providing more than two thirds of the commitments to lend under the Credit Agreement.  The term extensions only bind the lenders who vote to approve the extensions, but the Borrowers have the option to add additional lenders if the facility is not fully subscribed for the additional terms.  The Credit Agreement also contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional $500 million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders.
Allstate Life Insurance Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant.

Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule II of the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Debentures from the Registrant.

6
any material increase in the consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Final Prospectus) or any material increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Final Prospectus.
(p)   There are no material contracts, agreements or understandings between the Company and any person granting such person the right to require the Company to file a registration statement under the Act with respect to any notes or debt of the Company owned or to be owned by such person or to require the Company to include such securities for registration pursuant to the Registration Statement or pursuant to any other registration statement filed by the Company under the Act.

(s)   During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
(t)    The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed with or submitted to the Commission under the Exchange Act is made known to management, including the Company's principal executive officer and the Company's principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Covenants of the Underwriters; Offering Restrictions
Each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than (x) the Final Term Sheet and (y) one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities and that would not constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus.  The Underwriters acknowledge and agree that, except for information consistent in all material respects with the Final Term Sheet and except as may be set forth in Schedule III or IV, the Company has not authorized or approved any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Act) for use in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriters.
(a)  
(b)   Each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, any of the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction, including those jurisdictions set forth on Schedule IX, except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof.
10.   .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a)   The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as:  (i) such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Time of Sale
13
Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including those set forth on Schedule III or IV hereof; or (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.  The Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case arising in connection with this Section 10 to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however
(b)   Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
(c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party:  (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below) and to participate in and assume the defense of the claim associated with such action; , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if:  (A) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (B) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (C) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
provided, however
14
and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (D) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding
(d)   In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 10 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities; , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things:  (i) whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other; (ii) the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge; (iii) access to information; and (iv) the opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 10, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
Losses
provided, however
15
11.   .  If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by the Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, set forth opposite their names on Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, set forth on Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, this Agreement will terminate without any liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 11, the Time of Delivery shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (including by means of a free writing prospectus) or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Defaulting Underwriters
provided, however
12.   .  This Agreement is subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplements thereto).
Termination
13.   .  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 10 hereof, and will survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities.  The provisions of Section 8 and 10 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

For purposes of this paragraph, a notice to the Company by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Company.

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Company (on behalf of the relevant Borrower) and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
