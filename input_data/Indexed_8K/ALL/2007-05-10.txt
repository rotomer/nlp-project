If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page LIBOR01, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date for that Quarterly Interest Period.  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Quarterly Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Quarterly Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000.  However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Quarterly Interest Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Quarterly Interest Period or, in the case of the Quarterly Interest Period beginning on May 15, 2037, 5.356%.  The establishment of Three-Month LIBOR for each Quarterly Interest Period by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding.

Obligation to Issue Qualifying APM Securities
(i)            the foregoing obligations shall not apply to the extent that (A) the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock issued during such Deferral Period together with (B) the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period, the proceeds of which, in the case of clause (A) and clause (B), were applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock immediately prior to the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the ""); provided that the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period, at which point the Company must pay any deferred interest regardless of the time at which it was deferred, pursuant to this Section 2.6, subject to a Market Disruption Event; and provided, further, that if the Common Equity Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period at the termination of such Deferral Period and will not apply again unless and until the Company starts a new Deferral Period;

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once the Company reaches the Common Equity Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company shall not be required to issue more Common Stock, or if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been amended to eliminate Common Stock, more Qualifying Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period even if the Common Equity Issuance Cap subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (y) so long as the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has not been amended to eliminate Common Stock, the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Company's sole discretion, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount, and the Company is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and no
19
class of investors of the Company's securities, or any other party, may require the Company to issue Qualifying Warrants.
(b)           .  Section 2.6(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, if the Company shall have provided to the Trustee (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided, or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of this period, but the Company was unable after using commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid deferred interest.

Event of Default
(1)           default in the payment of interest, including compounded interest, in full on any Debentures for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of a 10-year period following the commencement of any Deferral Period if at such time such Deferral Period has not ended; or
(2)           default in the payment of principal on the Debentures when due, whether at the Stated Maturity, upon redemption, upon a declaration of acceleration, or otherwise, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.2 of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture; or

(ii)           Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 502 of the Base Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
"SECTION 502.  .
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
If an Event of Default set forth in Section 501 of the Base Indenture (as amended by Section 2.7(a)(i) of the Fifth Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures may declare the principal amount of all of the Debentures and interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such amount shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in Article Five of the Base Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1)           the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A)          all Defaulted Interest on all Debentures,
22
(B)           the principal of (and premium, if any, on) the Debentures which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures,
(C)           to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures, and
(D)          all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2)           all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided under Section 513 of the Base Indenture.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon."
(b)           The Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures such notices as it shall from time to time be required or permitted to provide with respect to the Debentures under Section 602 of the Base Indenture.  In addition, the Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures notice of any Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures within 90 days after the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of such Event of Default or other event.  However, except in cases of a default or an Event of Default in payment on the Debentures, the Trustee will be protected in withholding the notice if one of its Responsible Officers determines that withholding of the notice is in the interest of such Holders.
(c)           The Company's failure to pay interest on the Debentures in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6 shall constitute a default under the Indenture, but shall in no event constitute an Event of Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Base Indenture or this Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall have no obligation to exercise any remedies with respect to any such default unless and except to the extent directed in writing to do so by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 512 and 603(5) of the Base Indenture.  The Trustee may conclusively assume that Sections 2.5 and 2.6 have been complied with unless the Company or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures have given the Trustee written notice to the contrary.
(d)           For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Debentures under the Indenture, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Base Indenture or the terms of the Debentures or the terms of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture, including the Company's obligations under Section 2.2 (a)(iv), Section 2.5 or Section 2.6, shall be an Event of Default
23
with respect to the Debentures, other than those specified in this Section 2.7; and except as provided herein and in the Base Indenture with respect to the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and as provided in Section 2.7(c) above, the Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to exercise any remedies or otherwise take any action in respect of any other default that may occur under or in respect of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture or the Base Indenture.

SECTION 2.9.                          Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event of the Company shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of such Debentures, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) pursuant to Section 2.5 that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.5 and 2.6 to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds the interest that relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not been paid.

provided, however

If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page LIBOR01, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date for that Quarterly Interest Period.  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate.  If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Quarterly Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of such quotations.  If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Quarterly Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Quarterly Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000.  However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Quarterly Interest Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Quarterly Interest Period or, in the case of the Quarterly Interest Period beginning on May 15, 2017, 5.356%.  The establishment of Three-Month LIBOR for each Quarterly Interest Period by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding.

Obligation to Issue Qualifying APM Securities
(i)            the foregoing obligations shall not apply to the extent that (A) the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock issued during such Deferral Period together with (B) the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period, the proceeds of which, in the case of clause (A) and clause (B), were applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock immediately prior to the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the ""); provided that the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period, at which point the Company must pay any deferred interest regardless of the time at which it was deferred, pursuant to this Section 2.6, subject to a Market Disruption Event; and provided, further, that if the Common Equity Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period at the termination of such Deferral Period and will not apply again unless and until the Company starts a new Deferral Period;

If the Company amends the definition of Qualifying APM Securities to eliminate Common Stock, then the number of shares constituting the Share Cap Amount will be increased by 100%.

If the Share Cap Amount has been reached and it is not sufficient to allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to pay deferred interest in full, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to increase the Share Cap Amount (1) only to the extent that the Company can do so and simultaneously satisfy its future fixed or contingent obligations under other securities and derivative instruments that provide for settlement or payment in shares of the Common Stock or (2) if the Company cannot increase the Share Cap Amount pursuant to the preceding clause (1), by requesting the Company's Board of Directors, subject to its fiduciary duties, to adopt a resolution for shareholder vote at the next occurring annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of shares of the Company's authorized Common Stock for purposes of satisfying the Company's obligations to pay deferred interest.
For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once the Company reaches the Common Equity Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, the Company shall not be required to issue more Common Stock, or if the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has been amended to eliminate Common Stock, more Qualifying Warrants pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period even if the Common Equity Issuance Cap subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and (y) so long as the definition of Qualifying APM Securities has not been amended to eliminate Common Stock, the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Company's sole discretion, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Share Cap Amount, and the Company is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and no
19

Event of Default

(2)           default in the payment of principal on the Debentures when due, whether at the Stated Maturity, upon redemption, upon a declaration of acceleration, or otherwise, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.2 of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture; or

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in clauses (3) or (4) set forth in this Section 501, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law."
(ii)           Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 502 of the Base Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
"SECTION 502.  .
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment
If an Event of Default set forth in Section 501 of the Base Indenture (as amended by Section 2.7(a)(i) of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures may declare the principal amount of all of the Debentures and interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such amount shall become immediately due and payable.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in Article Five of the Base Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1)           the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:
(A)          all Defaulted Interest on all Debentures,
22
(B)           the principal of (and premium, if any, on) the Debentures which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures,
(C)           to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Debentures, and
(D)          all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(2)           all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided under Section 513 of the Base Indenture.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon."
(b)           The Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures such notices as it shall from time to time be required or permitted to provide with respect to the Debentures under Section 602 of the Base Indenture.  In addition, the Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures notice of any Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures within 90 days after the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of such Event of Default or other event.  However, except in cases of a default or an Event of Default in payment on the Debentures, the Trustee will be protected in withholding the notice if one of its Responsible Officers determines that withholding of the notice is in the interest of such Holders.
(c)           The Company's failure to pay interest on the Debentures in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6 shall constitute a default under the Indenture, but shall in no event constitute an Event of Default.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Base Indenture or this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall have no obligation to exercise any remedies with respect to any such default unless and except to the extent directed in writing to do so by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 512 and 603(5) of the Base Indenture.  The Trustee may conclusively assume that Sections 2.5 and 2.6 have been complied with unless the Company or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures have given the Trustee written notice to the contrary.
(d)           For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Debentures under the Indenture, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Base Indenture or the terms of the Debentures or the terms of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, including the Company's obligations under Section 2.2 (a)(iv), Section 2.5 or Section 2.6, shall be an Event of Default
23
with respect to the Debentures, other than those specified in this Section 2.7; and except as provided herein and in the Base Indenture with respect to the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and as provided in Section 2.7(c) above, the Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to exercise any remedies or otherwise take any action in respect of any other default that may occur under or in respect of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture or the Base Indenture.

SECTION 2.9.                          Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that if a Bankruptcy Event of the Company shall occur prior to the redemption or repayment of such Debentures, such Holder shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) pursuant to Section 2.5 that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.5 and 2.6 to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds the interest that relates to the earliest two years of the portion of the Deferral Period for which interest has not been paid.
