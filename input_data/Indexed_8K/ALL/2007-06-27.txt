On June 27, the Registrant entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase approximately $500 million of its outstanding common stock from Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. ("Lehman OTC").  The exact purchase price per share and number of shares to be delivered by Lehman OTC will be fixed in accordance with the agreement.  It is expected that Lehman OTC will purchase the shares that it delivers under the agreement in the market within the next four months.  The agreement will be settled at its conclusion with the Registrant either receiving or paying a settlement amount based on the volume weighted average price of the Registrant's common stock during the period of Lehman OTC's purchases.  The Registrant may elect to receive or pay any settlement amount in cash or shares of its common stock.
The agreement is part of the previously announced $4.0 billion repurchase program that the Registrant plans to complete by March 31, 2008.   All of the shares acquired by Registrant under the agreement will be placed into its treasury.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
