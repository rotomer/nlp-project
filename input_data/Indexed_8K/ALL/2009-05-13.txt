(r)    During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
 
(s)   The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are effective in providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed with or submitted to the Commission under the Exchange Act is made known to management, including the Company's principal executive officer and the Company's principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
 
9.     .
Covenants of the Underwriters; Offering Restrictions
 
Each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than (x) the Final Term Sheet and (y) one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities and that would not constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus.  The Underwriters acknowledge and agree that, except for information consistent in all material respects with the Final Term Sheet and except as may be set forth in Schedule III or IV, the Company has not authorized or approved any "issuer information" (as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Act) for use in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the Underwriters.
(a)  
 
(b)   Each Underwriter acknowledges, represents and agrees that it has not offered, sold or delivered and it will not offer, sell or deliver, any of the Securities, in or from any jurisdiction, including those jurisdictions set forth on Schedule IX, except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof.
 
10.   .
Indemnification and Contribution
 
(a)   The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as:  (i) such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including those set forth on Schedule III or IV hereof; or (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.  The Company agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case arising in connection with this
provided, however
Section 10 to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
 
(b)   Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
 
(c)   Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party:  (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below) and to participate in and assume the defense of the claim associated with such action; , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if:  (A) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (B) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (C) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (D) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action),
provided, however
and (y) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding
 
(d)   In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 10 is unavailable to, or insufficient to hold harmless, an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities; , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the total price at which the applicable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things:  (i) whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other; (ii) the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge; (iii) access to information; and (iv) the opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 10, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
Losses
provided, however
 
If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by the Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to
11.   . 
Defaulting Underwriters
take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, set forth opposite their names on Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, set forth on Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Series A Securities or Series B Securities, as applicable, this Agreement will terminate without any liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 11, the Time of Delivery shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (including by means of a free writing prospectus) or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided, however
 
12.   .  This Agreement is subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's securities shall have been suspended by the Commission, (ii) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (iii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplements thereto).
Termination
 
13.   .  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 10 hereof, and will survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities.  The provisions of Section 8 and 10 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A
 
This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depositary or a nominee of a Depositary. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, and no transfer of this Security (other than a transfer of this Security as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary) may be registered except in limited circumstances.
 
Unless this Security is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company (55 Water Street, New York, New York) to the issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO. or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                            on
May 16, 2014
.  The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum outstanding from May 
13
, 2009, or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on
May 16
and

of each year commencing
November 16
, 2009 at the rate of
6.200

The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay).  A "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks in the City of New York and Boston, Massachusetts are
not required by law to close.  The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the
 
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on May 1 or November 1 prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
 
The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest on this Security shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States in such coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of this Security is Cede & Co., the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by Cede & Co. All payments of principal and interest hereunder shall be made in immediately available funds.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid for any purpose.

EXHIBIT A
 
This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depositary or a nominee of a Depositary. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, and no transfer of this Security (other than a transfer of this Security as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary) may be registered except in limited circumstances.
 
Unless this Security is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company (55 Water Street, New York, New York) to the issuer or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company," which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO. or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                                 on
May 16, 2019
.  The Company further promises to pay interest on said principal sum outstanding from May 
13
, 2009, or from the most recent interest payment date (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date") to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on
May 16
and
November 16
of each year commencing
November 16
, 2009 at the rate of
7.450
% per annum, until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable and, until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment.  The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  The amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis of the number of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  In the event that any date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay).  A "Business Day" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks in the City of New York and Boston, Massachusetts are
not required by law to close.  The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on May 1 or November 1 prior to such Interest Payment Date.  Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Security not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which this Security may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
 
The principal of (and premium, if any) and the interest on this Security shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States in such coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the registered Holder at such address as shall appear in the Security Register.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of this Security is Cede & Co., the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by Cede & Co. All payments of principal and interest hereunder shall be made in immediately available funds.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid for any purpose.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed.
 
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Dated: May 13, 2009
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company, designated as its
7.450
% Senior Notes, Series B due
2019
(herein referred to as the "Securities"), issued under and pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of December 16, 1997 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, successor in interest to State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 23, 1999 and the Sixth Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 12, 2000 and as supplemented by the Fifteenth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 
13
, 2009, between the Company and the Trustee (the Indenture as so amended and supplemented, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
The Company may redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of such securities to be redeemed or (ii) an amount, as determined by an Independent Investment Banker, equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on the securities to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis
(assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 45 basis points, plus, in either of the above cases, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
 
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date:
 
the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity) under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue.  If no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or
(i)
           
 
if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week
(ii)
          
 
preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
 
The Adjusted Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date.
 
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the securities to be redeemed that would be used, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such securities ("Remaining Life").
 
"Comparable Treasury Price" means (i) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by us.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means:
 
each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Barclays Capital Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in the United States (a "Primary  Treasury Dealer"), the Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and
(i)
           
 
any two other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company.
(ii)
          
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City Time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date.
 
The Company will mail a notice of redemption at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of the securities to be redeemed.  If less than all of the securities are to be redeemed, the trustee will select, by such method as it will deem fair and appropriate, including pro rata or by lot, the securities to be redeemed in whole or in part.
 
Unless we default in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the securities or portions thereof called for
 
redemption.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.  No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture (other than Section 1302 and Section 1303 of the Indenture) shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company to pay the principal and interest on the Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 1002 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar, duly executed by the Holder hereof or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. 
This Global Security is exchangeable for Securities in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture.  Securities of this series so issued are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations herein and therein set forth, Securities of this series so issued are exchangeable for a
 
like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
The Company and, by its acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest therein, the Holder of, and any Person that acquires a beneficial interest in, this Security agree that for United States federal, state and local tax purposes it is intended that this Security constitute indebtedness.
 
THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN THE INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF.
