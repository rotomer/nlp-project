NEWS
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
NORTHBROOK, Ill., August 4, 2010  The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2010:
 
 
 
* Measures used in this release that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("non-GAAP") are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and operating measures are defined in the "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" section of this document.
 
"We made continued progress in executing our strategies and achieving our 2010 goals in the second quarter," said Thomas J. Wilson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of The Allstate Corporation.  "Profitability at Allstate Protection met our underlying combined ratio outlook for the year.  Implementation of growth initiatives reduced the impact of catastrophe risk management and profitability actions, but has not yet generated sufficient volume to increase overall policies in force. Allstate Financial's operating income significantly rebounded reflecting progress on its strategic repositioning and the benefit of reserve actions.  Strong investment results reflect our risk mitigation and return optimization strategies.
 
"Operating income was $0.81 per diluted share for the quarter compared to $0.55 per diluted share for the same quarter last year due to a decline in catastrophe losses from a record second quarter level in 2009. Net income was $0.27 per diluted share as derivative losses reduced earnings.  Derivative losses, however, were more than offset by corresponding increases in investment valuations so that book value per share increased by 3% in the quarter," said Wilson.
 
Consolidated Financial Results
 
Allstate's second quarter 2010 operating income rose to $441 million compared to $297 million in the same period of 2009, reflecting improved results in both Property-Liability and Allstate Financial.  Net income was $145 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $389 million in the second quarter of 2009 primarily due to realized capital losses in the 2010 quarter versus realized capital gains in the prior year period.  Realized capital losses in the second quarter of 2010 reflect risk management actions, including derivative losses that were offset by increased portfolio valuations.  Book value rose to $33.24 per share at June 30, 2010 compared to $32.26 at March 31, 2010 and $27.87 at June 30, 2009, reflecting higher shareholders' equity primarily resulting from increased market valuations for fixed income investments.
 
Property-Liability Combined Ratio Reflects Continued Strong Auto Performance
 
Property-Liability results for the second quarter of 2010 reflect Allstate Protection's implementation of actions to profitably grow standard auto and improve homeowners returns.  Property-Liability premiums written increased 0.4% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year second quarter.  Allstate brand growth of 1.6% contributed to the premium increase, partially offset by a 20.4% Encompass brand decline when compared to the second quarter a year ago.  Actions to improve Encompass profitability negatively impacted results.
 
Allstate's Property-Liability business produced an underlying combined ratio within the company's full-year outlook range of 88 to 90.  The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, was 88.1 in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 87.2 in the same period of 2009, primarily due to a higher expense ratio.  The recorded combined ratio was 96.8 for the second quarter of 2010, a 3.2 point improvement from the second quarter of 2009.
 
Catastrophe losses totaled $636 million during the second quarter of 2010, reflecting 30 events with losses of $758 million, offset by favorable reserve reestimates of $39 million on first quarter 2010 events and $83 million on prior years' events.  This compares to catastrophe losses of $818 million for the second quarter of 2009.  Catastrophe losses added 9.8 points to the combined ratio during the second quarter of 2010.  Although lower than the record second quarter impact in 2009 of 12.5 points, it was 3.2 points higher than Allstate's 19-year average for a second quarter of 6.6 points.
 
Allstate brand standard auto premiums written* increased 1.9% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year second quarter, due to a 3.3% increase in average premium.  Increased average premium was offset by a 1.7% decline in policies in force as the rate of new business was not sufficient to overcome the business lost at renewal.  Standard auto retention was comparable to the prior year second quarter at 89.0 despite a slight decline in Allstate's customer loyalty index score during the quarter.  New issued applications increased 0.4% compared to the prior year second quarter.  The Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio was 94.5, a decline of 0.4 points from the second quarter of 2009, due to growth in earned premiums as well as favorable prior year reserve reestimates.
 
Allstate brand homeowners premiums written for the second quarter of 2010 increased 2.2% compared to the same period a year ago, as a 6.1% increase in average premium was partly offset by a 4.0% decline in policies in force.  The combined ratio was 104.4 in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 116.3 in the second quarter a year ago, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and lower non-catastrophe claim costs. 
Rate increases averaging 11.3% in 14 states were approved during the second quarter, reflecting actions to improve returns and lessen the volatility of the homeowners results.
 
Allstate Financial Strategy Gaining Traction
 
Allstate Financial made significant progress on reinventing its business model during the second quarter.  The goals are to produce higher returns, reduce concentrations in products with returns dependent on investment spread, and serve Allstate customers by focusing on Allstate agencies and expanding Allstate Workplace Division.
 
Premiums and deposits* on mortality and morbidity (underwritten) products increased 12.1% when compared to the second quarter of 2009, including increases in policies sold through the Allstate Workplace Division and
 
Allstate agencies.  Consistent with the strategy, premiums and deposits on fixed annuity sales declined by 60.2% compared to the prior year period.
 
Allstate Financial operating income was $125 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $65 million in the prior year second quarter.  The increase was due to lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and a higher investment spread, partly offset by a lower benefit spread.  DAC amortization declined primarily due to a re-estimation of reserves and lower amortization on annuities.  The investment spread increased to $134 million in the second quarter of 2010 from $63 million in the prior year second quarter.  The change was due to lower net investment income being more than offset by decreased interest credited to contractholder funds, which includes lower amortization of deferred sales inducements.  The benefit spread declined 24.4% from the prior year second quarter due to the re-estimation of reserves and adverse mortality experience, partly offset by growth in accident and health products.  The re-estimation of reserves related to the use of refined policy level information and assumptions for interest-sensitive life insurance and immediate annuities, resulting in a net reserve increase of $27 million, after-tax, and a decrease in DAC amortization of $32 million, after-tax, for a net favorable impact to operating income of $5 million, after-tax.
 
Allstate Financial reported a net loss of $107 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to net income of $19 million in the 2009 second quarter.  The second quarter of 2010 net loss reflected $226 million of after-tax realized capital losses including the impact of related deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements.  The second quarter of 2009 reflected an after-tax realized capital loss of $49 million, including the impact of deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements.
 
Proactive Investment Strategies Provide Returns
 
Allstate's consolidated investment portfolio was $99.9 billion at June 30, 2010, slightly lower than at March 31, 2010, as improved valuations and operating cash flows were offset by reductions in Allstate Financial's spread-based business.  Valuation increases were primarily driven by the effect of declining interest rates on fixed income securities, and resulted in an improvement of $1.2 billion in the net unrealized position during the second quarter.  Allstate's net unrealized gain at June 30, 2010 was $400 million, pre-tax, compared to a net unrealized loss of $849 million, pre-tax, at March 31, 2010 and a net unrealized loss of $7.3 billion, pre-tax, at June 30, 2009.
 
Net realized capital loss for the second quarter of 2010 was $451 million, pre-tax, compared to a net realized capital gain of $328 million in the prior year second quarter, with derivatives being responsible for the majority of the $779 million difference.  Derivative net losses totaled $310 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to a gain of $419 million in the second quarter of 2009, driven primarily by Allstate's risk management actions.  Net realized capital loss for the second quarter of 2010 also reflected $239 million of impairment write-downs and $67 million of intent write-downs primarily related to residential and commercial real estate exposure, partly offset by net realized gains of $145 million from sales.
 
Derivative net losses were the result of interest rate and equity market declines.  Declining interest rates resulted in $259 million of losses from Allstate's risk management actions.  However, the loss was less than the increase in fixed income valuations during the period.  Declining equity markets resulted in derivative losses of $106 million from equity exposures embedded in fixed income securities, partly offset by $82 million in gains from equity market hedges.
 
As part of the company's ongoing strategy to manage exposure to certain portfolio segments, reductions of municipal fixed income securities totaled $1.6 billion of amortized cost and commercial real estate totaled $966 million of amortized cost during the second quarter of 2010.  In addition, a lower allocation to equity securities was maintained while the market experienced a significant downturn in the quarter.
 
Net investment income for the second quarter of 2010 was $1.0 billion, 5.3% less than the second quarter of 2009 and consistent with the first quarter of 2010.  The decline from the prior year second quarter primarily resulted from lower short-term interest rates, risk reduction actions related to municipal bonds and commercial real estate, and duration-shortening actions taken to protect the portfolio from rising interest rates.  Net investment income in the Property-Liability portfolio totaled $310 million in the second quarter of 2010, a 7.2% decline from the second quarter of 2009, but a 2.0% increase from the first quarter of 2010.  Allstate Financial's net investment income was $723 million, a 5.4% decline from the second quarter of 2009 and a 1.1% decline from the first quarter of 2010.
 
Strong Capital Position
 
"The combination of our proactive strategies and favorable investment results improved book value," said Don Civgin, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
 
Book value per share grew to $33.24 at June 30, 2010 compared to $32.26 at March 31, 2010 and $27.87 at June 30, 2009.  The book value increases reflected higher shareholders' equity, primarily resulting from improved investment valuations.  Statutory surplus at June 30, 2010 was an estimated $14.9 billion for Allstate Insurance Company, including $3.2 billion at Allstate Life Insurance Company.  This compares to statutory surplus of $15.4 billion for Allstate Insurance Company at March 31, 2010 and $13.8 billion at June 30, 2009.  The statutory surplus reduction from March 31, 2010 to June 30, 2010 includes a $200 million dividend from Allstate Insurance Company to the holding company.  A total of $3.1 billion in deployable assets were available at the holding company level at June 30, 2010.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP and operating financial measures.  Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income
is net income (loss), excluding:
 
     
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,
     
amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses,
     
gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and
     
adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.
 
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income.
 
We use operating income as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations.  We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the company's ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, gain (loss) on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses and gain (loss) on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Consistent with our intent to protect results or earn additional income, operating income includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are reported in realized capital gains and losses because they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  These instruments are used for economic hedges and to replicate fixed income securities, and by including them in operating income, we are appropriately reflecting their trends in our performance and in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, product attributes (e.g., net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or replicated investments.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Accordingly, operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business.  A byproduct of excluding these items to determine operating income is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Operating income is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) to assess our performance.  We use adjusted measures of operating income and operating income per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), operating income and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management's performance.We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator.  Operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
 
 
The following tables reconcile operating income and net income (loss) for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.
 
 
 
Underwriting income (loss)
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of the results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.   Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the "Segment Results" page.
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates ("underlying combined ratio")
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between three GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio and the effect of prior year non-catastrophe reserve reestimates on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the 2010 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to the combined ratio is provided in the following table.
 
 
In this news release, we provide our outlook range on the 2010 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  A reconciliation of this measure to the combined ratio is not possible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of catastrophes.  Future prior year reserve reestimates are expected to be zero because reserves are determined based on our best estimate of ultimate loss reserves as of the reporting date.
 
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities,
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities and related DAC, DSI and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
 
We use the trend in book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.
 
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share, and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  The following table shows the reconciliation.
 
 
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the following table.
 
 
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales.  It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.
 
The following table illustrates where premiums and deposits are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
 
 
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements about our outlook for the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates for 2010.  These statements are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections.  Actual results may differ materially from those projected based on the risk factors described below.
 
                 
Premiums written and premiums earned, the denominator of the underlying combined ratio, may be materially less than projected.  Policyholder attrition may be greater than anticipated resulting in a lower amount of insurance in force.
                 
Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of standard auto insurance claims may adversely affect our underwriting results.  Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment.  Changes in
 
bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation.  Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices.  The short-term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term.  A decline in gas prices, increase in miles driven, and higher unemployment are examples of factors leading to a short-term frequency change.  A significant long-term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our underwriting results.
We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements.  This news release contains unaudited financial information.
 

Exhibit 99.2
The consolidated financial statements and financial exhibits included herein are unaudited. These consolidated financial statements and exhibits should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The results of operations for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
 
Measures used in these financial statements and exhibits that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") and operating measures are denoted with an asterisk (*) the first time they appear. These measures are defined on the page "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" and non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure herein.

Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 includes expense of $254 million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses recorded in the first quarter of 2009.  This valuation allowance was released in connection with the adoption of new OTTI accounting guidance on April 1, 2009; however, the release was recorded as an increase to retained income and therefore did not reverse the amount recorded in income tax expense.

As a result of the net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009, weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding resulting from stock options of 0.6 million were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share since inclusion of these securities would have an anti-dilutive effect.  Accordingly, the sum of our income (loss) per share amounts for the quarters of 2009 may not equal the year-to-date per share amount.

Based on historical premiums written in those states, rate changes approved for the three month period ending June 30, 2010 are estimated to total $167 million.  Rate changes do not include rating plan enhancements, including the introduction of discounts and surcharges, that result in no change in the overall rate level in the state.

Basis of Presentation
This homeowners supplemental information schedule displays financial results for the homeowners business (defined to include standard homeowners, scheduled personal property and other than primary residence lines) for the period 1992 through 2010.  The premiums and losses are presented on a GAAP basis with adjustments as indicated in Notes 3 and 4.  Each state in which the Company writes business has been categorized into one of two exposure groupings (Hurricane or Other).   Hurricane exposure states are comprised of those states in which hurricanes are the primary catastrophe exposure. However, the catastrophe losses for these states include losses due to other kinds of catastrophes.  A catastrophe is defined by Allstate as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million, and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event.
(2)
 
Hurricane Exposure States
Hurricane exposure states include the following coastal locations:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
(3) 
Incurred Losses
Incurred losses (which include catastrophe losses) and Catastrophe losses, exclude the effects of those events for which the exposure is now covered, at least in part, by permanent industry reinsurance or insurance mechanism (i.e., Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), California Earthquake Authority) or with Hawaii hurricanes, coverage is being brokered to a non-affiliated insurance company.  Mechanisms such as the FHCF and external reinsurance are available and are reflected in our capital structure and help mitigate exposure to these types of events.   For the period 1992 - 2009, Incurred losses and Catastrophe losses for the Hurricane exposure states were adjusted to exclude $1.8 billion for losses related to Hurricane Andrew.  Incurred losses and Catastrophe losses for the Other catastrophe exposure states were adjusted to exclude an additional $1.8 billion for losses related to certain California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes.  Subsequent catastrophes of a similar magnitude are not excluded from the exhibit.  Through the use of the insurance mechanisms, Allstate may have a contingent liability for industry assessments and losses exceeding the claims paying capacity of these mechanisms as discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(4)
 
Earned Premiums
Earned premiums for the Hurricane exposure locations was adjusted to add back premium ceded to third party reinsurers of $178 million for hurricane reinsurance purchased in Florida, the Northeast and other states during the period 1992 to 2005.  These programs support management actions that address hurricane exposures.  Mechanisms such as the FHCF and external reinsurance are available and are reflected in our capital structure because they help mitigate exposure to these types of events, but no impact is reflected in earned premiums above.

The Valuation of Securities Taskforce of the NAIC instituted a new process to be used by insurance companies during the fourth quarter of 2009 for statutory accounting, reporting and estimating risk-based capital requirements for non-agency RMBS, and as a result the NAIC ratings used for statutory reporting may differ from those shown above. The credit ratings shown here represent the external rating equivalent  to the displayed NAIC rating.

The insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency.  Although we evaluate premium deficiencies on the combined performance of our life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, in addition to annuity buy-outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies.
(3)
     
The DAC and DSI adjustment balance represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized.  Only the unrealized net capital gains and losses on the Allstate Financial fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life product portfolios are used in this calculation.  The reduction in unrealized net capital losses in the first quarter and second quarter of 2010 for these product portfolios was less than the reduction in unrealized net capital losses for the total Allstate Financial and consolidated portfolios.  The DAC and DSI adjustment balance, subject to limitations, is determined by applying the DAC and DSI amortization rate to unrealized net capital gains or losses.  Recapitalization of the DAC and DSI balances is limited to the originally deferred costs plus interest.  The DAC adjustment balance (88% of the total DAC and DSI adjustment balance) was limited as of March 31, 2009 because the calculated amount, when added to the DAC balance before the impact of unrealized capital gains and losses, was greater than originally deferred costs plus interest.  The DSI adjustment balance was limited as of March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009.  In periods subsequent to the adjustment balance reaching the limitation, the change in the adjustment will not trend in a linear relationship with the change in unrealized gains and losses until such time as the adjustment balance is below the limitation.  The DAC and DSI adjustment balance was below the limitation as of December 31, 2009, March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010.  The limitation amount changes from period to period based on changes in the DAC and DSI balance before the impact of unrealized capital gains and losses, as well as new deferrals and interest.

Included in par value are zero-coupon securities that are generally purchased at a deep discount to the par value that is received at maturity.  These primarily included corporate, municipal, foreign government and U.S. government and agencies zero-coupon securities with par value of $867 million, $6.94 billion, $1.19 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively.

Excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of amortized cost to par value would be 99.6% for corporates, 99.6% for municipals, 104.1% for foreign governments and 102.0% for U.S. government and agencies.  Similarly, excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of fair value to par value would be 103.7% for corporates, 101.1% for municipals, 109.1% for foreign governments and 105.7% for U.S. government and agencies.

Beginning April 1, 2009 for fixed income securities, impairment write-downs reflect the credit loss component of issue specific other-than-temporary declines in fair value where the amortized cost basis is not expected to be entirely recovered.  For periods prior to April 1, 2009 for fixed income securities and all periods for equity securities, impairment write-downs reflect issue specific other-than-temporary declines in fair value, including instances where the Company could not reasonably assert that the recovery period would be temporary.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures.  Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss), excluding:
- realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income (loss),
- amortization of DAC and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses,
- gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and
- adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.
 
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income (loss).   We use operating income (loss) as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations.  We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, gain (loss) on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses and gain (loss) on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process. Consistent with our intent to protect results or earn additional income, operating income (loss) includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are reported in realized capital gains and losses because they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  These instruments are used for economic hedges and to replicate fixed income securities, and by including them in operating income (loss), we are appropriately reflecting their trends in our performance and in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or replicated investments.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Accordingly, operating income (loss) excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business.  A byproduct of excluding these items to determine operating income (loss) is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Operating income (loss) is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) to assess our performance.  We use adjusted measures of operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), operating income (loss) and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance. We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income (loss) results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the Company and management's performance.  We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income (loss) as the denominator. Operating income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of operating income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the schedule, "Contribution to Income".
 
Underwriting income (loss)
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of the results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.   Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between two GAAP operating ratios:  the combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes to combined ratio is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates ("underlying combined ratio")
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between three GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratioand the effect of prior year reserve reestimates on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the 2009 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to combined ratio is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Operating income return on shareholders' equity
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of shareholders' equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12-months, after excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses.Return on shareholders' equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  We use operating income as the numerator for the same reasons we use operating income, as discussed above.  We use average shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses for the denominator as a representation of shareholders' equity primarily attributable to the Company's earned and realized business operations because it eliminates the effect of items that are unrealized and vary significantly between periods due to external economic developments such as capital market conditions like changes in equity prices and interest rates, the amount and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on shareholders' equity because it excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period.  We believe that this measure is useful to investors and that it provides a valuable tool for investors when considered along with net income return on shareholders' equity because it eliminates the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized net capital gains and losses that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and that are driven by economic developments, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management.  In addition, it eliminates non-recurring items that are not indicative of our ongoing business or economic trends. A byproduct of excluding the items noted above to determine operating income return on shareholders' equity from return on shareholders' equity is the transparency and understanding of their significance to return on shareholders' equity variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to have operating income return on shareholders' equity and return on shareholders' equity when evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income return on shareholders' equity results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management's utilization of capital.  Operating income return on shareholders' equity should not be considered as a substitute for return on shareholders' equity and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of return on shareholders' equity and operating income return on shareholders' equity can be found in the schedule, "Return on Shareholders' Equity".
 
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities,
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losseson fixed income securities and related DAC, DSI and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  We use the trend in book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share, and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  A reconciliation of book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities, and book value per share can be found in the schedule, "Book Value per Share".
 
Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measures.  Our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales.  It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.  An illustration of where premiums and deposits are reflected in the consolidated financial statements is included in the schedule, "Allstate Financial Results".
 
Definitions of GAAP Operating Ratios and Impacts of Specific Items on the GAAP Operating Ratios
 
We use the following operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property-Liability results.  We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability.  They are calculated as follows:
 
Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses.
 
Expense ratio
is the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
 
Combined ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.  The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.  The difference between 100% and the combined ratiorepresents underwriting income (loss) as a percentage of premiums earned.
 
Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned.  The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages onthe combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.
 
Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio
is the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio
is the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of pre-tax reserve reestimates on combined ratio
is the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio
is the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
