NEWS
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
NORTHBROOK, Ill., October 27, 2010  The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2010:
 
 
* Measures used in this release that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("non-GAAP") are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and operating measures are defined in the "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" section of this document.
 
"Our strategies to create shareholder value in an uncertain economic climate continue to generate positive results," said Thomas J. Wilson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of The Allstate Corporation.  "Net income of $367 million showed strong growth over the prior year third quarter and second quarter of this year.
 
"Profitability at Allstate Protection remains strong, with the underlying combined ratio consistently meeting our annual outlook range.  We remain comfortable with our range of 88 to 90 for the year.  Overall policies in force declined, but standard auto new issued applications improved as we implemented new marketing and growth initiatives.  Allstate Financial's net and operating income improved this quarter from a year ago, reflecting progress on its strategic repositioning. 
 
"Book value per share rose 7% during the quarter to $35.48 at September 30, 2010 reflecting profitability and strong investment results," said Wilson.
Consolidated Financial Results
Allstate's third quarter 2010 net income was $367 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to $221 million in the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower realized capital losses in 2010 versus 2009.  Operating income was $452 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $538 million in the same period of 2009, reflecting
a decline in Property-Liability partly offset by increases in Allstate Financial. 
 
Property-Liability Profitability is a Source of Financial Strength
Property-Liability remained a source of financial strength for the company while beginning to implement growth plans.  Allstate's Property-Liability business produced an underlying combined ratio within the company's full-year outlook range of 88 to 90.  The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, was 89.2 in the third quarter of 2010 compared to 88.0 in the same period of 2009, due to a higher expense ratio and increases in claim frequencies.  The recorded combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2010, compared to 94.7 in the third quarter of 2009. 
Catastrophe losses totaled $386 million during the third quarter of 2010, reflecting 29 events with losses of $371 million.  This compares to catastrophe losses of $407 million for the third quarter of 2009.  Catastrophe losses added 5.9 points to the combined ratio during the third quarter of 2010.
Property-Liability premiums written* declined 0.6% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year quarter.  Allstate's brand growth of 0.2% was more than offset by a 16.7% decline in the Encompass brand, reflecting actions to improve profitability.
Allstate brand standard auto premiums written declined 0.5% for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year third quarter.  This decline was driven by a 1.7% decline in policies in force, reflecting a 0.4 point decline in retention to 88.7%, partly offset by a 2.5% increase in new issued applications from the prior year third quarter.  Average premium increased 1.4% during the third quarter when compared to the prior year quarter. 
Allstate's Customer Loyalty Index (CLI) as of September 30, 2010 declined slightly from the prior quarter of 2010.  The Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio was 93.2, an increase of 0.5 points from the third quarter of 2009, due to higher claim frequencies. 
Allstate brand homeowners premiums written for the third quarter of 2010 increased 2.4% compared to the same period a year ago, as a 7.2% increase in average premium was partly offset by a 4.1% decline in policies in force. 
Rate increases averaging 4.2% in 15 states were approved during the third quarter, as Allstate took actions to improve returns and lessen the volatility of homeowners results.  The combined ratio was 104.7 in the third quarter of 2010 compared to 98.3 in the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates and a higher expense ratio.  Unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates in the third quarter of 2010 included a litigation settlement of $70 million.    
The Property-Liability expense ratio for the third quarter of 2010 was 25.1 compared to 24.7 in the prior year third quarter, primarily due to higher marketing expenditures.
 
Allstate Financial Strategy Gaining Traction
Allstate Financial made significant progress on its goals to produce higher returns, reduce concentrations in products with returns dependent on investment spread, and serve its customers by focusing on Allstate agencies and the Allstate Workplace Division. 
Consistent with this strategy, premiums and deposits* on mortality and morbidity (underwritten) products increased 8.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2009, while deposits on annuities declined by 30.3% compared to the prior year period.  Premiums and deposits trends reflect premium growth in the Allstate Workplace Division and Allstate agencies, and the discontinuation earlier this year of new business through financial institutions.
 
Allstate Financial operating income was $108 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $95 million in the prior year third quarter.  The increase was due to a higher investment spread and lower amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), partly offset by higher operating costs and expenses and a lower benefit
spread.  The investment spread increased to $127 million in the third quarter of 2010 from $109 million in the prior year third quarter.  The change reflected decreased interest credited to contractholder funds, partly offset by lower net investment income.  DAC amortization declined primarily due to a lower amortization rate on fixed annuities.  Operating costs and expenses rose as product distribution and marketing costs, employee benefits, and certain acquisition-related expenses increased.  The benefit spread declined 2.8% from the prior year third quarter due to an increase in contract benefits on immediate annuities, reflecting favorable mortality experience in the third quarter of 2009, partly offset by growth in accident and health products. 
Allstate Financial reported net income of $85 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to a net loss of $38 million in the 2009 quarter.  Net income reflected after-tax net realized capital losses, including the impact of deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements of $18 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $133 million in the third quarter of 2009. 
 
Strong Returns from Investment Portfolio
 
Allstate's consolidated investment portfolio was $102.2 billion at September 30, 2010, up $2.3 billion from June 30, 2010, as strong investment returns more than offset impacts from reductions in Allstate Financial's contractholder funds.  Investment returns reflect lower interest rates, improved equity markets, and significant cash flow generated by the portfolio.  Allstate's net unrealized gain at September 30, 2010 was $2.7 billion, pre-tax, compared to a net unrealized gain of $400 million, pre-tax, at June 30, 2010 and a net unrealized loss of $2.5 billion, pre-tax, at September 30, 2009.
 
Net realized capital loss for the third quarter of 2010 was $144 million, pre-tax, compared to $519 million in the prior year third quarter, with lower impairment write-downs, higher gains on sales and lower derivative losses driving the improvement.  Impairment write-downs of $137 million were primarily related to residential and commercial real estate exposure.  Net realized gains from sales of $319 million were due to sales of fixed income and equity securities.
 
Derivative net losses totaled $285 million in the third quarter of 2010 and were driven primarily by Allstate's risk management actions.  Declining interest rates resulted in $181 million of derivative losses, which were significantly less than the increases in the portfolio's fixed income valuations during the period.  Favorable valuations on equity securities were also significantly greater than the $115 million of derivative losses related to equity market hedges. 
 
As part of the company's ongoing strategy to manage exposure to certain portfolio segments, reductions of municipal fixed income securities totaled $2.4 billion of amortized cost and reductions of commercial real estate totaled $484 million of amortized cost during the third quarter of 2010. 
 
Net investment income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.0 billion, 7.3% less than the third quarter of 2009 and 4.2% less than the second quarter of 2010.  These declines primarily resulted from lower interest rates, risk reduction actions related to municipal bonds and commercial real estate, and duration management actions taken to protect the portfolio from rising interest rates.  Net investment income in the Property-Liability portfolio totaled $284 million in the third quarter of 2010, a 12.9% decline from the third quarter of 2009 and an 8.4% decrease from the second quarter of 2010.  Allstate Financial's net investment income was $707 million, a 5.0% decline from the third quarter of 2009 and a 2.2% decline from the second quarter of 2010.
 
Capital Position Continues to Improve
 
"The combination of higher net income and favorable investment returns resulted in a 15% increase in book value during the first nine months of 2010," said Don Civgin, senior vice president and chief financial officer.  "Our capital position continues to improve, providing us with greater flexibility in achieving our strategic priorities to improve customer loyalty, reinvent protection and retirement, and grow our businesses."
 
Book value per share grew to $35.48 per share at September 30, 2010 compared to $33.24 at June 30, 2010 and $30.84 at December 31, 2009.  Book value increased during the third quarter as higher shareholders' equity reflected improved investment valuations.  Statutory surplus at September 30, 2010 is an estimated $15.1 billion for Allstate Insurance Company, including $3.2 billion at Allstate Life Insurance Company.  This compares to Allstate Insurance Company statutory surplus of $14.9 billion at June 30, 2010 and $14.8 billion at September 30, 2009.  Deployable assets at the holding company level increased to $3.5 billion at
September 30, 2010, reflecting $400 million of dividends from Allstate Insurance Company during the third quarter.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP and operating financial measures.  Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
Operating income
is net income (loss), excluding:
      
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income,
      
amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses,
      
gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and 
      
adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. 
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income.
We use operating income as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations.  We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the company's ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, gain (loss) on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses and gain (loss) on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Consistent with our intent to protect results or earn additional income, operating income includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are reported in realized capital gains and losses because they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  These instruments are used for economic hedges and to replicate fixed income securities, and by including them in operating income, we are appropriately reflecting their trends in our performance and in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, product attributes (e.g., net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or replicated investments.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Accordingly, operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business.  A byproduct of excluding these items to determine operating income is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Operating income is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) to assess our performance.  We use adjusted measures of operating income and operating income per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), operating income and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management's performance.We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income as the denominator.  Operating income should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
 
The following tables reconcile operating income and net income (loss) for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.
 
Underwriting income (loss)
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of the results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.   Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the "Segment Results" page.
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates ("underlying combined ratio")
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between three GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio and the effect of prior year non-catastrophe reserve reestimates on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the 2010 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to the combined ratio is provided in the following table.
 
In this news release, we provide our outlook range on the 2010 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  A reconciliation of this measure to the combined ratio is not possible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of catastrophes.  Future prior year reserve reestimates are expected to be zero because reserves are determined based on our best estimate of ultimate loss reserves as of the reporting date.
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities,
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities and related DAC, DSI and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
We use the trend in book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share, and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  The following table shows the reconciliation.
 
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the following table.
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales.  It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.  The following table illustrates where premiums and deposits are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Life and annuity contract charges in the amount of $258 million and $250 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $772 million and $734 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are also revenues recognized for GAAP, have been excluded from the table above, but are a component of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations line item life and annuity premiums and contract charges. 
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This news release contains forward-looking statements about our outlook for the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates for 2010.  These statements are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections.  Actual results may differ materially from those projected based on the risk factors described below.
                  
Premiums written and premiums earned, the denominator of the underlying combined ratio, may be materially less than projected.  Policyholder attrition may be greater than anticipated resulting in a lower amount of insurance in force.
                  
Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of standard auto insurance claims may adversely affect our underwriting results.  Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment.  Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation.  Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices.  The short-term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term.  A decline in gas prices, increase in miles driven, and higher unemployment are examples of factors leading to a short-term frequency change.  A significant long-term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our underwriting results.
We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements.  This news release contains unaudited financial information.

Exhibit 99.2
The consolidated financial statements and financial exhibits included herein are unaudited. These consolidated financial statements and exhibits should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The results of operations for interim periods should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
 
Measures used in these financial statements and exhibits that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles ("non-GAAP") and operating measures are denoted with an asterisk (*) the first time they appear. These measures are defined on the page "Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures" and non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure herein.

Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 includes expense of $254 million attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance relating to the deferred tax asset on capital losses recorded in the first quarter of 2009.  This valuation allowance was released in connection with the adoption of new OTTI accounting guidance on April 1, 2009; however, the release was recorded as an increase to retained income and therefore did not reverse the amount recorded in income tax expense.

As a result of the net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009, weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding resulting from stock options of 0.6 million were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share since inclusion of these securities would have an anti-dilutive effect.  Accordingly, the sum of our income (loss) per share amounts for the quarters of 2009 may not equal the year-to-date per share amount.
 
(3)
 
In accordance with GAAP, the quarter and year-to-date per share amounts are calculated discretely.  Therefore, the sum of each quarter may not equal the year-to-date amount.

Rate changes include changes approved based on our net cost of reinsurance. These rate changes do not reflect initial rates filed for insurance subsidiaries initially writing business. Based on historical premiums written in those states, rate changes approved for the three month period ending September 30, 2010 are estimated to total $145 million. Rate changes do not include rating plan enhancements, including the introduction of discounts and surcharges, that result in no change in the overall rate level in the state.

The decrease in new issued applications in the first nine months of 2010 was impacted by decreases in Florida and California, due in part to rate actions that were approved in 2009 in these markets and other actions to improve profitability. Excluding Florida and California, new issued applications on a countrywide basis increased 13.5% to 428 thousand in the third quarter of 2010 from 377 thousand in the third quarter of 2009, and increased 11.1% to 1,185 thousand in the first nine months of 2010 from 1,067 thousand in the first nine months of 2009, with new issued application increases in 39 states, most of which offer an auto discount (the Preferred Package Discount) for our target customer (multi-car residence owner).
(4)    
The decrease in the renewal ratio of 0.4 points in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009, was primarily due to profitability management actions in California, Georgia, New York and North Carolina. The renewal ratio for the first nine months of 2010 was comparable to the same period of 2009.

Basis of Presentation
This homeowners supplemental information schedule displays financial results for the homeowners business (defined to include standard homeowners, scheduled personal property and other than primary residence lines) for the period 1992 through 2010.  The premiums and losses are presented on a GAAP basis with adjustments as indicated in Notes 3 and 4.  Each state in which the Company writes business has been categorized into one of two exposure groupings (Hurricane or Other).   Hurricane exposure states are comprised of those states in which hurricanes are the primary catastrophe exposure. However, the catastrophe losses for these states include losses due to other kinds of catastrophes.  A catastrophe is defined by Allstate as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million, and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event.
 
(2) 
Hurricane Exposure States
Hurricane exposure states include the following coastal locations:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
 
(3) 
Incurred Losses
Incurred losses (which include catastrophe losses) and Catastrophe losses, exclude the effects of those events for which the exposure is now covered, at least in part, by permanent industry reinsurance or insurance mechanism (i.e., Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), California Earthquake Authority) or with Hawaii hurricanes, coverage is being brokered to a non-affiliated insurance company.  Mechanisms such as the FHCF and external reinsurance are available and are reflected in our capital structure and help mitigate exposure to these types of events.   For the period 1992 - 2009, Incurred losses and Catastrophe losses for the Hurricane exposure states were adjusted to exclude $1.8 billion for losses related to Hurricane Andrew.  Incurred losses and Catastrophe losses for the Other catastrophe exposure states were adjusted to exclude an additional $1.8 billion for losses related to certain California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes.  Subsequent catastrophes of a similar magnitude are not excluded from the exhibit.  Through the use of the insurance mechanisms, Allstate may have a contingent liability for industry assessments and losses exceeding the claims paying capacity of these mechanisms as discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
(4) 
Earned Premiums
Earned premiums for the Hurricane exposure locations was adjusted to add back premium ceded to third party reinsurers of $178 million for hurricane reinsurance purchased in Florida, the Northeast and other states during the period 1992 to 2005.  These programs support management actions that address hurricane exposures.  Mechanisms such as the FHCF and external reinsurance are available and are reflected in our capital structure because they help mitigate exposure to these types of events, but no impact is reflected in earned premiums above.

The insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency.  Although we evaluate premium deficiencies on the combined performance of our life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, in addition to annuity buy-outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies. 
(3)
     
The DAC and DSI adjustment balance represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized.  Only the unrealized net capital gains and losses on the Allstate Financial fixed annuity and interest-sensitive life product portfolios are used in this calculation.  The reduction in unrealized net capital losses in the first, second and third quarter of 2010 for these product portfolios was less than the reduction in unrealized net capital losses for the total Allstate Financial and consolidated portfolios.  The DAC and DSI adjustment balance, subject to limitations, is determined by applying the DAC and DSI amortization rate to unrealized net capital gains or losses.  Recapitalization of the DAC and DSI balances is limited to the originally deferred costs plus interest.  The DAC adjustment balance (88% of the total DAC and DSI adjustment balance) was limited as of March 31, 2009 because the calculated amount, when added to the DAC balance before the impact of unrealized capital gains and losses, was greater than originally deferred costs plus interest.  The DSI adjustment balance was limited as of March 31, 2009, June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009.  In periods subsequent to the adjustment balance reaching the limitation, the change in the adjustment will not trend in a linear relationship with the change in unrealized gains and losses until such time as the adjustment balance is below the limitation.  The DAC and DSI adjustment balance was below the limitation in all periods beginning December 31, 2009.  The limitation amount changes from period to period based on changes in the DAC and DSI balance before the impact of unrealized capital gains and losses, as well as new deferrals and interest.

Included in par value are zero-coupon securities that are generally purchased at a deep discount to the par value that is received at maturity. These primarily included corporate, municipal, foreign government and U.S. government and agencies zero-coupon securities with par value of $728 million, $5.90 billion, $1.36 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively.

Excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of amortized cost to par value would be 99.8% for corporates, 99.6% for municipals, 103.9% for foreign governments and 101.5% for U.S. government and agencies. Similarly, excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of fair value to par value would be 106.4% for corporates, 102.7% for municipals, 114.0% for foreign governments and 104.4% for U.S. government and agencies.

Beginning April 1, 2009 for fixed income securities, impairment write-downs reflect the credit loss component of issue specific other-than-temporary declines in fair value where the amortized cost basis is not expected to be entirely recovered. For periods prior to April 1, 2009 for fixed income securities and all periods for equity securities, impairment write-downs reflect issue specific other-than-temporary declines in fair value, including instances where the Company could not reasonably assert that the recovery period would be temporary.
 
(2)   
Beginning April 1, 2009 for fixed income securities, change in intent write-downs reflect instances where the Company has made a decision to sell the security or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. For periods prior to April 1, 2009 for fixed income securities and all periods for equity securities, change in intent write-downs reflect instances where the Company could not assert a positive intent to hold until recovery.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures.  Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss), excluding:
 - realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income (loss),
 - amortization of DAC and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses,
 - gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and
 - adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years. 
 
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income (loss).   We use operating income (loss) as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations.  We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, gain (loss) on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses and gain (loss) on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Consistent with our intent to protect results or earn additional income, operating income (loss) includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are reported in realized capital gains and losses because they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  These instruments are used for economic hedges and to replicate fixed income securities, and by including them in operating income (loss), we are appropriately reflecting their trends in our performance and in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or replicated investments.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Accordingly, operating income (loss) excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business.  A byproduct of excluding these items to determine operating income (loss) is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Operating income (loss) is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) to assess our performance.  We use adjusted measures of operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), operating income (loss) and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income (loss) results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the Company and management's performance.  We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income (loss) as the denominator.  Operating income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of operating income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the schedule, "Contribution to Income".
 
Underwriting income (loss)
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of the results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.   Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between two GAAP operating ratios:  the combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes to combined ratio is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates ("underlying combined ratio")
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between three GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio and the effect of prior year reserve reestimates on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the 2009 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to combined ratio is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Operating income return on shareholders' equity
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of shareholders' equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12-months, after excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses. Return on shareholders' equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  We use operating income as the numerator for the same reasons we use operating income, as discussed above.  We use average shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses for the denominator as a representation of shareholders' equity primarily attributable to the Company's earned and realized business operations because it eliminates the effect of items that are unrealized and vary significantly between periods due to external economic developments such as capital market conditions like changes in equity prices and interest rates, the amount and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on shareholders' equity because it excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period.  We believe that this measure is useful to investors and that it provides a valuable tool for investors when considered along with net income return on shareholders' equity because it eliminates the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized net capital gains and losses that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and that are driven by economic developments, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management.  In addition, it eliminates non-recurring items that are not indicative of our ongoing business or economic trends. A byproduct of excluding the items noted above to determine operating income return on shareholders' equity from return on shareholders' equity is the transparency and understanding of their significance to return on shareholders' equity variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to have operating income return on shareholders' equity and return on shareholders' equity when evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income return on shareholders' equity results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management's utilization of capital.  Operating income return on shareholders' equity should not be considered as a substitute for return on shareholders' equity and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of return on shareholders' equity and operating income return on shareholders' equity can be found in the schedule, "Return on Shareholders' Equity".
 
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities,
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities and related DAC, DSI and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  We use the trend in book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share, and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  A reconciliation of book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities, and book value per share can be found in the schedule, "Book Value per Share".
 
Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measures.  Our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Premiums and deposits
is an operating measure that we use to analyze production trends for Allstate Financial sales.  It includes premiums on insurance policies and annuities and all deposits and other funds received from customers on deposit-type products including the net new deposits of Allstate Bank, which we account for under GAAP as increases to liabilities rather than as revenue.  An illustration of where premiums and deposits are reflected in the consolidated financial statements is included in the schedule, "Allstate Financial Results".
 
Definitions of GAAP Operating Ratios and Impacts of Specific Items on the GAAP Operating Ratios
 
We use the following operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property-Liability results.  We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability.  They are calculated as follows:
 
Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses.
 
Expense ratio
is the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
 
Combined ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.  The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.  The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income (loss) as a percentage of premiums earned.
 
Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned.  The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.
 
Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio
is the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses. 
 
Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio
is the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of pre-tax reserve reestimates on combined ratio
is the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses. 
 
Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio
is the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
