WHEREAS
, this Agreement is made for the sole benefit of the Beneficiaries and for the purpose of setting forth the duties and powers of the Trustee with respect to the Trust Account, and the Grantor's and Beneficiaries' rights and obligations with respect thereto; and
 
WHEREAS
, EICNJ is a wholly owned subsidiary of EIC and pursuant to the terms hereof has appointed EIC to act as its agent in connection with any and all matters under or in connection with this Agreement.
 
NOW, THEREFORE
, for and in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1.
                                         
Deposit of Assets to the Trust Account
.
 
(a)
                                 
The Grantor hereby establishes the Trust Account [in the State of New York] and the Trustee hereby accepts the Trust Account herein created and declared upon the terms provided herein and shall administer the Trust Account in the Grantor's name as Trustee for the Beneficiaries.  The Trust Account shall be subject to withdrawal by the Beneficiaries as provided herein.  The Trustee and its lawfully appointed successors are authorized and shall have power to receive such cash, securities and property as the Grantor from time to time may transfer or remit to or vest in the Trustee or place under the Trustee's possession and control, and to hold, invest, reinvest, manage and dispose of the same for the uses and purposes and in the manner and according to the provisions hereinafter set forth.  The Trustee shall receive and hold the Assets in a safe place at an office of the Trustee [in New York, New York].
 
(b)
                                
The Grantor shall transfer to the Trustee, for deposit to the Trust Account, the Assets listed on hereto, and shall transfer to the Trustee, for deposit to the Trust Account, such other assets as may from time to time be required by this Agreement (all such assets actually received in the Trust Account are herein referred to individually as an "Asset" and collectively as the "Assets").  The Assets shall consist only of Eligible Trust Assets (as hereinafter defined).
Exhibit B
 
(c)
                                 
Within 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter ending after the date hereof, the Grantor shall calculate and deliver to the Beneficiaries the amount of the Obligations as of the end of such calendar quarter (the "Required Balance"), along with a statement of the fair market value of the Assets in the Trust Account as of the end of such calendar quarter as determined by the Investment Manager, or in the absence of an Investment Manager, by the Trustee, in accordance with paragraph (d) below (the "Asset Valuation Report", and together with the calculation of the Required Balance, the "Quarterly Report").  If the fair market value of the Assets as of any calendar quarter end is less than the Required Balance as of such calendar quarter end, then within ten Business Days of its delivery to the Beneficiaries of the Quarterly Report for such calendar quarter, the Grantor shall cause to be deposited into the Trust Account such additional assets consisting of Eligible Trust Assets with an aggregate fair market value equal to such shortfall.  If the fair market value of the Assets as of any calendar quarter end is greater than 102% of the Required Balance as of such calendar quarter end, then within ten Business Days of its receipt of the Quarterly Report for such calendar quarter, the Beneficiaries shall instruct the Trustee to release to the Grantor Assets with an aggregate fair market value equal to such excess.
 
(d)
                                
As used in this Trust Agreement, the fair market value of any Asset shall mean the fair market value of such Asset as calculated by the Investment Manager, or in the absence of an Investment Manager, by the Trustee.  In providing this calculation, the Investment Manager or the Trustee, as applicable, shall use prices published by a nationally recognized pricing service for assets for which such prices are available, and for assets for which such prices are not available, the Investment Manager or the Trustee, as applicable, shall use methodologies consistent with those which it uses for determining the fair market value of assets held for its own account in the ordinary course of business.  If either the Grantor or the Beneficiaries shall
dispute the valuation of any Asset, and the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days, the fair market value of such Asset shall be determined by a Third Party Appraiser and the parties shall be bound by such valuation.

The Withdrawal Notice may designate a third party (the "Designee") to whom Assets or amounts specified therein shall be delivered.  A Beneficiary need present no statement or document in addition to a Withdrawal Notice in order to withdraw any Assets; nor is such right of withdrawal or any other provision of this Agreement subject to any conditions or qualifications not contained in this Agreement.  The Beneficiaries agree to provide to the Grantor a copy of any Withdrawal Notice at the same time as such notice is provided to the Trustee.

Application of Assets

(a)
                                 
Each Beneficiary hereby covenants to the Grantor that it shall withdraw Assets from the Trust Account, and use and apply any such withdrawn Assets, without diminution because of the insolvency of such Beneficiary or the Grantor, for the following purposes only:
 
(i)
                                    
to pay or reimburse such Beneficiary for the Grantor's share under the Reinsurance Agreement with such Beneficiary of any losses and allocated loss expenses paid or incurred by such Beneficiary, but not recovered from the Grantor pursuant to the terms of such Reinsurance Agreement, or for unearned premiums due to such Beneficiary under the terms of such Reinsurance Agreement if not otherwise paid by the Grantor;
 
(ii)
                                 
to pay the Grantor any amounts held in the Trust Account that exceed 102% of the Obligations;
 
(iii)
                              
where a Beneficiary has received a Termination Notice (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement and where all of the Obligations have been liquidated or discharged ten days prior to the Termination Date (as hereinafter defined), to make payment to the Grantor of any amounts held in the Trust Account; and
 
(iv)
                             
where a Beneficiary has received a Termination Notice pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement and where all or any part of the Obligations remain unliquidated and undischarged ten days prior to the Termination Date, to withdraw Assets equal to the Obligations and deposit such amounts in a separate account (the "Termination Account"), in the name of the Beneficiaries in any Qualified Fiduciary United States Financial Institution (as hereinafter defined), apart from the Beneficiaries' other assets, in trust for the uses and purposes specified in subparagraphs (i)  (iii) of this Section as may remain executory after such withdrawal and for any period after such Termination Date.  The relative rights and obligations of the Grantor and the Beneficiaries under this Agreement shall apply to the Termination Account.  The Beneficiaries shall pay interest in cash to the Grantor on the amount withdrawn, equal to the actual amount of interest, dividends and other income earned on the assets in the Termination Account.  The Beneficiaries may at any time substitute or exchange any assets held in the Termination Account and invest or reinvest such assets, provided that the assets so substituted or exchanged and all reinvestment assets are in cash equivalents.
 
(b)
                                
In the event that Assets are withdrawn in excess of amounts due under Sections (a)(i)  (a)(iv) above, the Beneficiaries or the Grantor, as applicable, shall promptly return to the Trust Account such excess Assets withdrawn.

(a)
                                 
Upon call or maturity of a Trust Asset, the Trustee may withdraw the Asset without the consent of the Beneficiaries if the Trustee provides notice to the Beneficiaries, liquidates or redeems the Asset, and the proceeds are paid to the Trust Account.
 
(b)
                                
With consent of the Beneficiaries, the Grantor may appoint an investment manager (the "Investment Manager") with respect to the Trust Account.  Any such appointment shall be pursuant to a written investment management agreement that requires the Investment Manager to manage the Assets in the Trust Account consistent with the definition of Eligible Trust Assets.  For so long as the Grantor is an Affiliate of White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd., the Beneficiaries' consent shall not be required for the appointment of any Affiliate of White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. which is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, as Investment Manager.

(d)
                                
Except as provided in Section 4(a), the Trustee shall allow no substitution of Assets except on written instructions from the Beneficiaries for each individual substitution at the time the substitution is executed.  From time to time, the Grantor may request that the Beneficiaries give such written instructions to the Trustee, which instructions shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  The Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine the value of such substituted securities or that such substituted securities constitute Eligible Trust Assets.  The Beneficiaries' prior written approval of such substitution shall be deemed to approve such substituted securities as Eligible Trust Assets.
 
(e)
                                 
The Beneficiaries and the Grantor agree that all investments, reinvestments and substitutions of securities referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section 4 shall be in compliance with the definition of "Eligible Trust Assets" in Section 13 of this Agreement.  The Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine that any Assets in the Trust Account are or continue to be Eligible Trust Assets.  The Trustee, based upon Investment Orders from the Investment Manager or the Grantor if no Investment Manager is appointed, shall execute Investment Orders and settle securities transactions by itself or by means of an agent or
 
broker (provided that such securities shall ultimately be held only by the Trustee and not by such agent or broker).  The Trustee shall not be responsible for any act, error or omission, or for the solvency, of any Investment Manager, agent or broker unless such act, error or omission is the result, in whole or in part, of the Trustee's negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith.  The Trustee shall not be responsible for any Loss (as hereinafter defined) suffered by the Beneficiaries or the Grantor due to the insolvency of any agent or broker unless the Trustee negligently, willfully or with lack of good faith chooses the agent or broker.
 
(f)
                                   
Any loss, liability, claim or damage paid or incurred ("Loss") from any investment, reinvestment or substitution pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be borne exclusively by the Trust Account other than a Loss due to the Trustee's own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith.  Without limiting any other provision herein, the Trustee shall not be liable for any Loss due to changes in market rates or penalties for early redemption.  Other than the execution of an Investment Order, as provided herein, the Trustee shall not be required to take any action with respect to the investment or reinvestment of the Assets.

(b)

(c)
                                 
From time to time, the Trustee may elect, but shall not be required to, credit the Income Account with the amount of interest and dividends due in respect of Assets in the Trust Account before actually receiving such payments from a payor, Depository (as hereinafter defined), broker or other agent.  Any such crediting shall be at the Grantor's sole risk, and the Trustee shall be authorized to reverse any such credit in the event it does not receive good funds from such payor, Depository, broker or other agent.  The Trustee shall not be required to enforce collection by legal means or otherwise of any such payment, but shall use reasonable diligence to make all such collections as may be affected in the ordinary course of business.

Section 14.
                                  
Definitions
.
 
Except as the context shall otherwise require, the following terms shall have the following meanings for all purposes of this Agreement (the definitions to be applicable to both the singular and the plural forms of each term defined if both such forms of such term are used in this Agreement):
 
The term "Affiliate" of a Person means any other Person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the first Person.  A corporation is an affiliate of another corporation, regardless of ownership, if substantially the same group of Persons manage the two corporations.
 
The term "Business Day" shall mean any day on which the office of the Trustee [in New York, New York] is open for business.
 
The term "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, by common management or otherwise.
