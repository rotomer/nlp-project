Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This news release contains forward-looking statements about catastrophe losses. These statements are based on our estimates and assumptions that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management believes the estimated impact of catastrophe losses, including net loss reserves, are appropriately established and recorded based on available facts, information, laws and regulations. However, actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements in this news release and from the amounts currently recorded for a variety of reasons, including in the following:
                 
Our policyholders' ability to report and our ability to adjust claims have been impeded by the extent of the devastation and the number of areas affected.
                 
It is particularly difficult to assess the extent of damage in the initial stages of adjusting residential property losses.
                 
Our estimate for the ultimate costs of repairs may not prove to be correct because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by the catastrophes.
                 
The number of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims may be greater or less than currently anticipated.
 
We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
