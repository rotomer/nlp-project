Exhibit 99.1
NEWS
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
NORTHBROOK, Ill., October 31, 2011  The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2011:
 
 
"Maintaining auto insurance profitability and proactively managing our investment portfolio enabled us to overcome an increase of $691 million in catastrophe losses from the third quarter of 2010 and still earn a profit," said Thomas J. Wilson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of The Allstate Corporation.  "Progress was made in improving auto insurance profitability in New York and Florida and raising underlying returns in homeowners insurance.  A small decline in auto insurance policies during the last twelve months is related to the impact of improving profitability in New York and Florida and a 4% decline in homeowners policies.  The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio of 88.9 for the first three quarters of 2011 continued to compare favorably with our full-year guidance range of 88 to 91.
 
"Allstate Financial's results were solid and investment results were also strong in the quarter.  Allstate Financial's operating income increased 24.1% from the prior year third quarter to $134 million in the third quarter of 2011 reflecting improved margins and lower expenses.  These improvements were partially offset by the managed reduction in the size of the fixed annuity business.  Proactive risk and return strategies enabled us to maintain the portfolio yield, realize net capital gains and increase the absolute level of fixed income unrealized gains in the quarter.
 
"We completed the $1 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter, and the acquisition of Esurance and Answer Financial in early October," Wilson concluded.
 
Property-Liability Impacted by Catastrophe Losses, Underlying Profitability Within Guidance
 
Allstate's Property-Liability combined ratio for the third quarter of 2011 was 104.8, reflecting the previously reported catastrophe losses of $1.1 billion, or 16.7 points.  During the period, Allstate experienced 23 catastrophe loss events, including Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.  Excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates, the Property-Liability underlying combined ratio was 89.2 during the third quarter of 2011, consistent with the third quarter of 2010.  Total Allstate brand policies in force declined as of September 30, 2011 compared to the prior year quarter driven by standard auto and homeowners declines, but were partly offset by growth in the Emerging Business lines and Canada.
 
Allstate brand standard auto premiums written* declined by 0.8% from the prior year third quarter as increased average premiums were offset by lower policies in force.  Average gross premium increased 1.1% in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010, as rate increases were partially offset by reduced volumes in New York and Florida where average premiums are above the countrywide average.  Policies in force declined during the quarter, consistent with the company's expectation, as growth was balanced with a focus on maintaining auto profitability.  New issued applications declined 13.2% in the quarter when compared to the prior year, while retention improved to 89.1 from 88.7 in the third quarter of last year.  The Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio was 94.2, 1.0 points higher than the third quarter of 2010
.
 
Allstate brand homeowners premiums written increased 1.5% in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period a year ago, as a 5.0% increase in average gross premium was partly offset by a 4.2% decline in policies in force. 
Rate increases averaging 13.9% were approved in 15 states during the third quarter, as Allstate continued to take actions to improve homeowners returns.  Policies in force declined reflecting restrictions in new business and, to a lesser degree, the decision not to offer continuing coverage to some policyholders.  The Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio was 131.9 for the third quarter of 2011 as catastrophe losses impacted the combined ratio by 55.8 points.  Excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates, the Allstate brand homeowners underlying combined ratio was 73.3 in the third quarter of 2011, compared to 75.0 in the third quarter of 2010.
 
Allstate Financial Strategy Produces Improved Financial Results
 
Allstate Financial's strategy of reducing concentration in, and improving the profitability of, investment spread products, expanding the sales of underwritten products through Allstate agencies and growing Allstate Benefits resulted in improved financial results.  Operating income increased to $134 million in the third quarter, which was 24.1% above the third quarter of 2010.   Net income increased to $183 million in the third quarter of 2011 compared to $85 million in the same quarter of 2010.
 
Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges were essentially flat to the prior year quarter as growth in underwritten products was offset by a decline in annuity sales.  Premiums and contract charges on products sold through Allstate agencies were 5.3% higher than the prior year quarter.  Deferred fixed annuity contractholder funds declined $4.0 billion, or 13.4%, as of September 30, 2011 compared to September 30, 2010, as surrenders and maturities outpaced new sales.  Allstate Benefits' premiums and contract charges were 2.7% higher than the third quarter of 2010.
 
Operating income was $26 million higher than the third quarter of 2010 as increases in the investment spread and lower expenses were only partly offset by declines in the benefit spread.  The investment spread increased 11.8% to $142 million in the third quarter when compared to the prior year third quarter, as actions to improve investment portfolio yields and lower crediting rates on annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance more than offset the effect of a continued decline in spread-based business in force.  The benefit spread decreased to $134 million in the third quarter from $141 million in the 2010 third quarter, due primarily to unfavorable mortality experience on annuities and life insurance, partly offset by higher profitability and growth at Allstate Benefits and higher contract charges on interest-sensitive life insurance.  The improvement in net income was due to net realized capital gains in the third quarter, versus net realized capital losses in the third quarter of last year, and increased operating income.
 
Proactive Management of Investment Portfolio Maintains Yield and Return
 
Allstate's proactive management of risk and return during the first nine months of 2011 was focused on enhancing yields and total risk adjusted returns.  The fixed income yields were maintained, despite lower
interest rates, by increasing corporate bond allocations, reducing investments in government securities and slightly lengthening duration.  Interest rate derivative positions, which were used for overall risk management purposes in 2010, were also terminated in 2011.  Additional actions to manage risk included reducing select exposures to municipal bonds and European Union banks and reallocating portions of below investment grade exposures from structured securities to high-yield corporate bonds.
 
Allstate's consolidated investment portfolio totaled $97.5 billion at September 30, 2011 compared to $100.5 billion at December 31, 2010, as the Allstate Financial portfolio declined in size with the reduction in the fixed annuity business.   Net investment income was $994 million for the third quarter of 2011, which was 1.1% below the prior year quarter primarily due to lower portfolio balances.  The total portfolio yield was 4.5% for the third quarter of 2011, which was higher than the prior year quarter and consistent with the second quarter of 2011.  Net realized capital gains for the third quarter of 2011 were $264 million, pre-tax, compared to a net realized capital loss of $144 million, pre-tax, in the third quarter of 2010.  Realized gains in the current year quarter were primarily due to sales of foreign government and U.S. Treasury securities, which were partly offset by losses on the valuation of interest rate derivatives resulting from lower interest rates and impairments on real estate-related and equity securities.   Net unrealized capital gains totaled $2.4 billion, pre-tax, at September 30, 2011 compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2010, as the benefit of lower interest rates was only partially offset by realized gains.
 
Share Repurchases Total $308 Million, Completing $1 Billion Program
 
"We completed our share repurchase program during the third quarter bringing total share repurchases to $20 billion over the last 17 years," said Don Civgin, executive vice president and chief financial officer.  Allstate repurchased shares totaling $308 million during the third quarter of 2011, completing the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized in November of 2010.
 
Statutory surplus at September 30, 2011 was an estimated $14.4 billion for Allstate Insurance Company, including $3.7 billion at Allstate Life Insurance Company.  This compares to Allstate Insurance Company statutory surplus of $15.1 billion at June 30, 2011 and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2010.  During the third quarter of 2011, Allstate Insurance Company paid a $200 million dividend to the holding company.  Deployable assets at the holding company level totaled $3.4 billion at September 30, 2011 compared to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2011 and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2010.
 
"Book value per share totaled $35.56 at September 30, 2011, compared to $35.95 at June 30, 2011 and $35.48 at September 30, 2010.  Strong auto profitability, realized capital gains and an increase in unrealized gains on the fixed income portfolio so far this year have offset the impact of high catastrophe losses and a decline in the value of our equity portfolio
," Civgin concluded.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP and operating financial measures.  Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss), excluding:
      
realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income (loss),
      
valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax,
      
amortization of DAC and DSI, to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses or valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged,
      
gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and
      
adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.
 
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income (loss).
 
We use operating income (loss) as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations.  We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the company's ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, gain (loss) on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses, valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged and gain (loss) on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Consistent with our intent to protect results or earn additional income, operating income (loss) includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are reported in realized capital gains and losses because they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  These instruments are used for economic hedges and to replicate fixed income securities, and by including them in operating income (loss), we are appropriately reflecting their trends in our performance and in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, product attributes (e.g., net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or replicated investments.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Accordingly, operating income (loss) excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business.  A byproduct of excluding these items to determine operating income is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Operating income (loss) is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) to assess our performance.  We use adjusted measures of operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), operating income (loss) and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management's performance.We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income (loss) as the denominator.  Operating income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.
 
 
The following tables reconcile operating income (loss) and net income (loss).
 
 
 
 
Underwriting income (loss)
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of the results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.   Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the "Segment Results" page.
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates ("underlying combined ratio")
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between three GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio and the effect of prior year non-catastrophe reserve reestimates on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.
 
A reconciliation of the Property-Liability combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to the Property-Liability combined ratio is provided in the following table.
 
 
In this news release, we provide our outlook range on the Property-Liability 2011 combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  A reconciliation of this measure to the combined ratio is not possible on a forward-looking basis because it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of catastrophes.  Future prior year reserve reestimates are expected to be zero because reserves are determined based on our best estimate of ultimate loss reserves as of the reporting date.
 
A reconciliation of the Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to the Allstate brand standard auto combined ratio is provided in the following table.
 
 
A reconciliation of the Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to the Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio is provided in the following table.
 
 
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities,
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities and related DAC, DSI and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
 
We use the trend in book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share, and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  The following table shows the reconciliation.
 
 
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the following table.
 
 
 
Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors
This news release contains forward-looking statements about our outlook for the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates for 2011.  These statements are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on management's estimates, assumptions and projections.  Actual results may differ materially from those projected based on the risk factors described below.
                  
Premiums written and premiums earned, the denominator of the underlying combined ratio, may be materially less than projected.  Policyholder attrition may be greater than anticipated resulting in a lower amount of insurance in force.
                  
Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of standard auto insurance claims may adversely affect our underwriting results.  Changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our Allstate Protection segment.  Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and litigation.  Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices.  The short-term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term.  A decline in gas prices, increase in miles driven, and higher unemployment are examples of factors leading to a short-term frequency change.  A significant long-term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our underwriting results.
We undertake no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statements.  This news release contains unaudited financial information.

Basis of Presentation
This homeowners supplemental information schedule displays financial results for the homeowners business (defined to include standard homeowners, scheduled personal property and other than primary residence lines) for the period 1992 through 2011.  The premiums and losses are presented on a GAAP basis with adjustments as indicated in Notes 3 and 4.  Each state in which the Company writes business has been categorized into one of two exposure groupings (Hurricane or Other).   Hurricane exposure states are comprised of those states in which hurricanes are the primary catastrophe exposure. However, the catastrophe losses for these states include losses due to other kinds of catastrophes.  A catastrophe is defined by Allstate as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million, and involves multiple first party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event.
(2)
 
Hurricane Exposure States
Hurricane exposure states include the following coastal locations:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
(3)
 
Incurred Losses
Incurred losses (which include catastrophe losses) and Catastrophe losses, exclude the effects of those events for which the exposure is now covered, at least in part, by permanent industry reinsurance or insurance mechanism (i.e., Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund ("FHCF"), California Earthquake Authority) or with Hawaii hurricanes, coverage is being brokered to a non-affiliated insurance company.  Mechanisms such as the FHCF and external reinsurance are available and are reflected in our capital structure and help mitigate exposure to these types of events.   For the period 1992 - 2010, Incurred losses and Catastrophe losses for the Hurricane exposure states were adjusted to exclude $1.8 billion for losses related to Hurricane Andrew.  Incurred losses and Catastrophe losses for the Other catastrophe exposure states were adjusted to exclude an additional $1.8 billion for losses related to certain California earthquakes and Hawaii hurricanes.  Subsequent catastrophes of a similar magnitude are not excluded from the exhibit.  Through the use of the insurance mechanisms, Allstate may have a contingent liability for industry assessments and losses exceeding the claims paying capacity of these mechanisms as discussed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Earned Premiums
Earned premiums for the Hurricane exposure locations was adjusted to add back premium ceded to third party reinsurers of $178 million for hurricane reinsurance purchased in Florida, the Northeast and other states during the period 1992 to 2005.  These programs support management actions that address hurricane exposures.  Mechanisms such as the FHCF and external reinsurance are available and are reflected in our capital structure because they help mitigate exposure to these types of events, but no impact is reflected in earned premiums above.

The insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency.  Although we evaluate premium deficiencies on the combined performance of our life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies, the adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies, in addition to annuity buy-outs and certain payout annuities with life contingencies.

Included in par value are zero-coupon securities that are generally purchased at a deep discount to the par value that is received at maturity.  These primarily included corporate, U.S. government and agencies, municipal and foreign government zero-coupon securities with par value of $474 million, $948 million, $3.52 billion and $382 million, respectively.

Excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of amortized cost to par value would be 100.4% for corporates, 102.5% for U.S. government and agencies, 101.0% for municipals and 103.1% for foreign governments.  Similarly, excluding the impact of zero-coupon securities, the percentage of fair value to par value would be 105.6% for corporates, 107.3% for U.S. government and agencies, 105.1% for municipals and 109.5% for foreign governments.

Securities rated below investment grade comprise securities with a rating of Ba or lower. As of September 30, 2011, 50% of our below investment grade gross unrealized losses were concentrated in RMBS, specifically Alt-A and Subprime.  The fair value of these securities totaled $928 million, a decrease of 14.4%, compared to $1.08 billion as of December 31, 2010, primarily due to sales.  Gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled $445 million as of September 30, 2011, an improvement of 19.7%, compared to $554 million as of December 31, 2010, due to impairment write-downs, principal collections and sales, partially offset by the downgrade of certain securities to below investment grade and lower valuations.

Definitions of Non-GAAP and Operating Measures
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures.  Our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Operating income (loss)
is net income (loss), excluding:
- realized capital gains and losses, after-tax, except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments, which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in operating income (loss),
- valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax,
- amortization of deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducements ("DSI"), to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses or valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, after-tax,
- gain (loss) on disposition of operations, after-tax, and
- adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items, when (a) the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years, or (b) there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years.
 
Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure that is most directly comparable to operating income (loss).   We use operating income (loss) as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations.  We believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the Company's ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged, gain (loss) on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non-recurring, infrequent or unusual items.  Realized capital gains and losses, valuation changes on embedded derivatives that are not hedged and gain (loss) on disposition of operations may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions, the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  Consistent with our intent to protect results or earn additional income, operating income (loss) includes periodic settlements and accruals on certain derivative instruments that are reported in realized capital gains and losses because they do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  These instruments are used for economic hedges and to replicate fixed income securities, and by including them in operating income (loss), we are appropriately reflecting their trends in our performance and in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments, product attributes (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to contractholder funds) or replicated investments.  Non-recurring items are excluded because, by their nature, they are not indicative of our business or economic trends.  Accordingly, operating income (loss) excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business.  A byproduct of excluding these items to determine operating income (loss) is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Operating income (loss) is used by management along with the other components of net income (loss) to assess our performance.  We use adjusted measures of operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) per diluted share in incentive compensation.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income (loss), operating income (loss) and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance. We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income (loss) results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the Company and management's performance.  We note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward-looking valuation technique uses operating income (loss) as the denominator. Operating income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of operating income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the schedule, "Contribution to Income".
 
Underwriting income (loss)
is calculated as premiums earned, less claims and claims expense ("losses"), amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.  Management uses this measure in its evaluation of the results of operations to analyze the profitability of our Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results.  It is also an integral component of incentive compensation.  It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance.   Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  Underwriting income (loss) should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of Property-Liability underwriting income (loss) to net income (loss) is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between two GAAP operating ratios:  the combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio. We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes to combined ratio is provided in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates ("underlying combined ratio")
is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between three GAAP operating ratios: the combined ratio, the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio and the effect of prior year reserve reestimates on the combined ratio.  The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the combined ratio.  We believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our Property-Liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  These catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio.  Prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves.  We believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance.  We also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.  The combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of the combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates to combined ratio is provided in the schedules, "Property-Liability Results", "Standard Auto Profitability Measures" and "Homeowners Profitability Measures".
 
Operating income return on shareholders' equity
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by dividing the rolling 12-month operating income by the average of shareholders' equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12-months, after excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses. Return on shareholders' equity is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  We use operating income as the numerator for the same reasons we use operating income, as discussed above.  We use average shareholders' equity excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses for the denominator as a representation of shareholders' equity primarily attributable to the Company's earned and realized business operations because it eliminates the effect of items that are unrealized and vary significantly between periods due to external economic developments such as capital market conditions like changes in equity prices and interest rates, the amount and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process.  We use it to supplement our evaluation of net income and return on shareholders' equity because it excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period.  We believe that this measure is useful to investors and that it provides a valuable tool for investors when considered along with net income return on shareholders' equity because it eliminates the after-tax effects of realized and unrealized net capital gains and losses that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and that are driven by economic developments, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management.  In addition, it eliminates non-recurring items that are not indicative of our ongoing business or economic trends. A byproduct of excluding the items noted above to determine operating income return on shareholders' equity from return on shareholders' equity is the transparency and understanding of their significance to return on shareholders' equity variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods.  Therefore, we believe it is useful for investors to have operating income return on shareholders' equity and return on shareholders' equity when evaluating our performance.  We note that investors, financial analysts, financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize operating income return on shareholders' equity results in their evaluation of our and our industry's financial performance and in their investment decisions, recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable, representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management's utilization of capital.  Operating income return on shareholders' equity should not be considered as a substitute for return on shareholders' equity and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business.  A reconciliation of return on shareholders' equity and operating income return on shareholders' equity can be found in the schedule, "Return on Shareholders' Equity".
 
Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities,
is a ratio that uses a non-GAAP measure.  It is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity after excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities and related DAC, DSI and life insurance reserves by total shares outstanding plus dilutive potential shares outstanding.  Book value per share is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  We use the trend in book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities in conjunction with book value per share to identify and analyze the change in net worth attributable to management efforts between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP ratio is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and are generally driven by economic developments, primarily capital market conditions, the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management, and we believe it enhances understanding and comparability of performance by highlighting underlying business activity and profitability drivers.  We note that book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, is a measure commonly used by insurance investors as a valuation technique.  Book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains and losses on fixed income securities, should not be considered as a substitute for book value per share, and does not reflect the recorded net worth of our business.  A reconciliation of book value per share, excluding the impact of unrealized net capital gains on fixed income securities, and book value per share can be found in the schedule, "Book Value per Share".
 
Operating Measure
 
We believe that investors' understanding of Allstate's performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following operating financial measure.  Our method for calculating this measure may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
 
Premiums written
is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period.  Premiums earned is a GAAP measure.  Premiums are considered earned and are included in financial results on a pro-rata basis over the policy period.  The portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.  A reconciliation of premiums written to premiums earned is presented in the schedule, "Property-Liability Results".
 
Definitions of GAAP Operating Ratios and Impacts of Specific Items on the GAAP Operating Ratios
 
We use the following operating ratios to measure the profitability of our Property-Liability results.  We believe that they enhance an investor's understanding of our profitability.  They are calculated as follows:
 
Claims and claims expense ("loss") ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses.
 
Expense ratio
is the ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
 
Combined ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.  The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.  The difference between 100% and the combined ratio represents underwriting income (loss) as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin.
 
Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio
is the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned.  The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.
 
Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio
is the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio
is the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of pre-tax reserve reestimates on combined ratio
is the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned.  This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses.
 
Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio
is the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned.
