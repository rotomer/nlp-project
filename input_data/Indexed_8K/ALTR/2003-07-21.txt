July 21, 2003Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced second quarter sales of $205.3 million, up 5% from the first quarter of 2003, ahead of the company's previous expectations of 3 - 4% sequential growth. Sales of the company's new products grew 21% sequentially.
San Jose, Calif.,
Second quarter net income was $36.1 million, $0.09 per diluted share, and compares to first quarter net income of $30.1 million, $0.08 per diluted share. Second quarter gross profit margin was 68.1% of sales and included a $9.2 million pretax benefit resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in 2001.
Altera repurchased 1.7 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $30.2 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
"Rapidly increasing sales of Altera's 0.13-micron-based device families, Stratix, Stratix GX and Cyclone, drove very strong new product growth this quarter. We designed all these families with completely new and innovative architectures in order to take full advantage of the performance gains achievable at this advanced process node, and, as a result, Altera has the strongest PLD offering available in the market today," said John Daane, president and chief executive officer. "With the announcement of HardCopy Stratix devices we have taken another step to extend the attractiveness of our high-end FPGAs. Our unique HardCopy solution gives customers all the benefits of PLD-based design and delivers a lower cost production device with enhanced performance, which will help drive more gains against competing alternatives."
 
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.
