Third quarter net income of $43.8 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, was up compared to second quarter net income of $36.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. Third quarter net income increased 87% compared to net income of $23.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2002. Third quarter gross profit margin was 68.7% of sales and included a $7.6 million pretax benefit resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in 2001.
 
Altera repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $58.0 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"Our new products once again drove our revenue growth. The Cyclone family remains on a very fast growth path, with sales double that of second quarter levels. We continue to see strong prototyping sales and a growing list of design wins for our Stratix family," said John Daane, president and chief executive officer. "We have announced our plans and are gearing up for 2004 to be a year of new product introductions across virtually all of our product range. We are confident that the development work that we have put into these new products will continue the market share gains we have experienced with our Stratix and Cyclone families."
