April 21, 2004Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced first quarter sales of $242.9 million, up 12% from the fourth quarter of 2003, and 25% from the first quarter of 2003. Sales of the company's new products grew 32% sequentially.
San Jose, Calif.,
 
First quarter net income was $58.8 million, $0.15 per diluted share, up 95% versus net income of $30.1 million, $0.08 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2003. Gross margin was 68.8% for the first quarter of 2004 versus 67.1% for the first quarter of 2003. Gross margin included a 150 basis point ($3.6 million) benefit in the first quarter of 2004 and a 470 basis point ($9.1 million) benefit in the first quarter of 2003 resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in 2001.
 
Altera repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $51.6 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"This has been another quarter with outstanding growth from our new products. Sales of Cyclone devices continue to ramp, with one million units shipped in this quarter, bringing our cumulative shipments to 2 million units. Cyclone devices are the clear leader among the newest generation low-cost FPGAs. In the high-density market, the combination of Stratix
devices and our HardCopy
solution continues to draw new customers to Altera, adding to our new product momentum," said John Daane, president and CEO. "We announced two next generation products during the quarterboth based on truly unique Altera architectures. Our 90-nm Stratix II devices use the industry's first adaptable FPGA architecture and are the industry's largest and fastest chips, offering performance and capabilities previously only available in ASICs and ASSPs. In addition, the MAX
II CPLD family signals the arrival of a radically different CPLD architecture. The MAX II family provides a superior solution for today's CPLD customers and the opportunity for Altera to set a new standard for the industry."
 
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.
