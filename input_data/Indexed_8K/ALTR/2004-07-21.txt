., July 21, 2004  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced second quarter sales of $269.0 million, up 11% from the first quarter of 2004 and 31% from the second quarter of 2003. Sales of the company's new products grew 45% sequentially.
San Jose, Calif
 
Second quarter net income was $75.3 million, $0.20 per diluted share, up 109% versus net income of $36.1 million, $0.09 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin was 69.9% for the second quarter of 2004 versus 68.1% for the second quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin included a 160 basis point ($4.4 million) benefit in the second quarter of 2004 and a 450 basis point ($9.2 million) benefit in the second quarter of 2003 resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in 2001. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.4%, bringing the effective tax rate to 23% on a year-to-date basis, consistent with management's current expectation of a 23% rate for the full year. This is a revision from the 25% effective tax rate recorded in the first quarter.
 
Altera repurchased 4.2 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $88.9 million and ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"This was a great quarter for Altera's Stratix
device family and our new product portfolio. The Stratix family was the largest selling product line, and we believe that production-based demand is just beginning. Demand for Cyclone devices showed healthy growth, reflecting the ready availability and appeal of this low-cost family, which remains the best selling advanced low-cost FPGA in the market today," said John Daane, president and CEO. "We are now shipping Stratix II and MAX
II devices to customers and expect a smooth roll out of these new families. We also announced our new Cyclone II family, with new features and much lower costs, which will give us further strength to penetrate markets traditionally beyond the reach of programmable logic."
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.
