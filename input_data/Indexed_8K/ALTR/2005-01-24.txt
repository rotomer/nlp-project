., January 24, 2005  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced 2004 sales of $1.02 billion, up 23%, compared to $827.2 million in 2003. New product sales increased 186%.

San Jose, Calif
 
Fourth quarter sales were $239.9 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2003 and down 9% from the third quarter of 2004, versus the company's prior guidance for sales reductions of 9% to 12%. Fourth quarter net income was $58.0 million, $0.15 per diluted share, up 28%, compared to net income of $45.1 million, $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Gross profit margin was 69.8% for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus 67.5% for the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
Altera's tax rate for 2004 was 16.8% and included a $17.1 million or a 5.2 percentage point tax rate benefit primarily related to a tax settlement with Hong Kong's Inland Revenue Department recorded in the third quarter. The effective tax rate for the year was lowered in the fourth quarter by 1 percentage point, resulting in a favorable fourth quarter adjustment of $2.6 million (3.7 percentage points) and an effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 18.3%.
 
Altera repurchased 8.3 million shares of its common stock during 2004 at a cost of $176.3 million, with 606,600 shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $12.6 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.
 
"The year's revenue growth, fueled by great new product traction and FPGA market share gains, demonstrates that our R&D investments are paying off. The last half of the year was very challenging, and even as business moderated, we maintained strong gross margins and kept inventories under control," said John Daane, president and CEO. "In 2004 we announced another generation of products with a distinct performance edge. We introduced our Nios
II processor, a higher performance and more flexible version of our industry-leading Nios soft-core processor. Our new programmable devices, Stratix
II and Cyclone
II FPGAs and MAX
II CPLDs, all have substantial competitive performance advantages and the potential for rapid new product growth in 2005 and beyond. Across all our served markets we are uncovering new applications for programmable logic as we continue to pursue the substantial growth opportunities available to us."
 
Altera continued to advance its leadership position in system-on-a-programmable-chip (SOPC) solutions.
