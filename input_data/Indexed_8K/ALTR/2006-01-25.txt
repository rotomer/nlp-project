EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
., January 25, 2006  Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR) today announced 2005 sales of $1.12 billion, up 11%, compared with $1.02 billion in 2004. New product sales increased 73%. Net income for 2005 was $278.8 million, $0.74 per diluted share, versus net income of $275.1 million, $0.72 per diluted share, in 2004.
San Jose, Calif
 
Fourth quarter sales were $281.9 million, up 18% from the fourth quarter of 2004 and down 3% from the third quarter of 2005. The company's prior guidance was for fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $286 to $297 million. Fourth quarter net income was $69.7 million, $0.19 per diluted share, up 20%, compared with net income of $58.0 million, $0.15 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Gross profit margin was 66.7% for the fourth quarter of 2005 versus 69.8% for the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Altera repurchased 19.9 million shares of its common stock during 2005 at a cost of $369.9 million, with 11.0 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $194.8 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and investments.
 
"We were the fastest growing major programmable logic company in 2005, as our Stratix and Cyclone series FPGAs drove market share gains," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "During the year we completed the rollout of the Cyclone II and MAX II families and announced our third generation HardCopy II structured ASICs and Stratix II GX transceiver-based FPGAs. Our product delivery performance was excellent and our lead times remained short. Customer-focused innovation, quality, and reliability made the year a success, and equip Altera for growth and solid performance in 2006."
 
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.
 
 
 
 
 
Business Outlook for the First Quarter 2006
 
Altera expects that first quarter sales will increase 4% to 7% sequentially. Gross margin will be in the range of 65.5% to 67.5%. With the company's adoption of SFAS123R, first quarter operating expenses will include approximately $20 million of share-based compensation charges. Including those charges, operating expenses are expected to be approximately $138 million. Inclusion of stock-based compensation charges in operating expense adds significantly to the volatility of actual versus expected expense due to volatility in our stock price, which we cannot predict. Other income will be approximately $10 million. The company anticipates that its first quarter and full year tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16%, including 200-300 basis points of benefit due to the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense in the income statement.
 
Note: The outlook above assumes the impact from the operation of the company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan will be nil.
