Effective May 9, 2006, Altera Corporation's Board of Directors approved a new payment schedule for the compensation payable to non-employee members of the Board. The new payment schedule is as follows:
(1) Non-employee directors will now receive a retainer of $40,000 for Board service with no separate fee for meeting attendance. The retainer payments will be made on the date of each year's annual meeting of stockholders and will be prorated if a director's service begins subsequent to the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. During 2005, our non-employee directors received $2,000 for each meeting of the Board attended in person, and $1,000 for each meeting attended by telephone. We also paid our non-employee directors an annual retainer of $12,000.
(2) Non-Chair members of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee will now receive an annual retainer of $4,000 per year. During 2005, our non-Chair members of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee received $2,000 for each meeting of a committee attended in person, and $1,000 for each meeting attended by telephone.
(3) The Chairs of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee will now receive an annual retainer of $8,000 per year. During 2005, the Chairs of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, like the non-Chair members of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, received $2,000 for each meeting of a committee attended in person and $1,000 for each meeting attended by telephone.
(4) Non-Chair members of the Audit Committee will now receive an annual retainer of $5,000 per year. During 2005, our non-Chair members of the Audit Committee received $2,000 for each meeting of the Audit Committee attended in person, and $1,000 for each meeting attended by telephone.
(5) The Chair of the Audit Committee will now receive an annual retainer of $10,000 per year. During 2005, the Chair of the Audit Committee received an annual retainer of $3,000, plus $2,000 for each meeting of the Audit Committee attended in person, and $1,000 for each meeting attended by telephone.
(6) The Lead Independent Director will receive an annual retainer of $5,000 per year.
A summary of non-employee director compensation arrangements reflecting the new payment schedule is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10.1
 
The annual retainer is paid on the date of each year's annual meeting of stockholders and can be deferred at the director's election under Altera's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. The annual retainer will be prorated if a director's service begins subsequent to the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. Non-employee directors are eligible to include the annual retainer in our Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
Each year, non-employee directors will receive a stock option grant of 10,000 shares upon re-election as a director. New non-employee directors will receive an initial stock option grant of 40,000 shares upon first becoming a director.
Non-employee directors are eligible to receive medical, dental, and vision coverage equivalent to benefits offered to employees.
Non-employee directors will be reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings.
