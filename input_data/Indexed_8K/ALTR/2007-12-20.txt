As previously announced on March 28, 2007, Altera Corporation's board of directors has approved a 57 million share repurchase program. On November 9, 2007, and November 20, 2007, Altera entered into contracts to conduct some of those repurchases pursuant to plans (the "Plans") complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). The Plans cover the period from December 8, 2007 to March 7, 2008, unless any or all Plans are earlier terminated. Repurchases made under each of the Plans will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(i) and, to the extent applicable, Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. Depending upon prevailing market conditions and other factors, there can be no assurance that shares of Altera's common stock will be purchased pursuant to the Plans. In no event will the cumulative amount of Altera common stock purchased under the Plans exceed the greater of $500 million or 35 million shares.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
