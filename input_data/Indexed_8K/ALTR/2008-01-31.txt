., January 31, 2008  Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced 2007 sales of $1.26 billion, down 2 percent compared with $1.29 billion in 2006. New product sales increased 65 percent. Net income for 2007 was $290.0 million, $0.82 per diluted share, versus net income of $323.2 million, $0.88 per diluted share, in 2006.
San Jose, Calif
Fourth quarter sales were $323.2 million, up 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006 and up 2 percent from the third quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter net income was $65.5 million, $0.20 per diluted share, down from net income of $99.9 million, $0.27 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. Fourth quarter 2007 results include a previously announced $5.2 million pretax restructuring charge.
Altera repurchased 58.0 million shares of its common stock during 2007 at a cost of $1.2 billion, with 26.0 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $509.3 million. Altera ended the quarter with $1.0 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share payable on March 3, 2008 to shareholders of record on February 11, 2008.
"This was a challenging yet productive year for Altera. Although softer demand led to a disappointing sales year, we are very pleased to have our 65-nm FPGAs shipping and being well received by our customers. This newest generation of FPGAs, with industry-leading low-power and superior performance, extends the innovation advantages which are the basis of our strong competitive position," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "In addition to these and other new device introductions, our newest software and intellectual property offerings round out a substantial year of Altera innovation. We also took major steps to lower operating expense in 2007, and we will do so again in 2008. In 2007 we initiated our first quarterly dividend and a significant increase in our share repurchase plan to return additional value to shareholders."
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.
