On November 30, 2009, Altera Corporation issued a press release announcing a business update for the fourth quarter. A copy of the business update is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced that, based on quarter-to-date results and the company's outlook for the remainder of the quarter, the company now expects sales for the fourth quarter to be 15 percent to 18 percent above third quarter levels. Previous guidance was for sales growth of 6 percent to 10 percent.
San Jose, Calif., November 30, 2009
The company expects all four of its vertical markets to be up sequentially in the fourth quarter reflecting a strong new product cycle as well as improving end market trends and customer desire for appropriate inventory to support sales levels. Sales to wireline and wireless telecommunications equipment manufacturers will likely be the largest contributor to fourth quarter growth as demand for Chinese and Indian deployments has continued to improve.
The company will announce fourth quarter results after the market close on January 26, 2010.
