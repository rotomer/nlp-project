Sales for 2009 were $1.20 billion, a decrease of 13 percent compared with $1.37 billion in 2008. Net income was $251.1 million, $0.84 per diluted share, versus net income of $359.7 million, $1.18 per diluted share, in 2008.
For the year, cash flow from operating activities was $372.7 million. Altera ended 2009 with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, an increase from $1.2 billion at 2008 year end.
Altera's board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on March 1, 2010 to shareholders of record on February 10, 2010.
"The fourth quarter produced extraordinary growth driven by customer program ramps and better end demand across all of our markets," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Our new products were the growth leaders in a quarter that saw sequential improvements across all product and market segment categories. We believe that in 2010 our 40-nm product leadership will create an additional growth driver for the company as customers shift from the prototype stage to production-based demand."
 
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress.
