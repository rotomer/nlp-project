Exhibit 99.1
Altera Corporation 101 Innovation Drive San Jose, CA 95134 Phone: 408-544-7000
Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced that, based on quarter-to-date results and the company's outlook for the remainder of the quarter, second quarter revenue is now expected to be at the high end of previous guidance, growing 10 to 12 percent sequentially. The company's prior guidance was for sequential growth of 8 to 12 percent.
San Jose, Calif., June 7, 2010
Once again, new products will be the quarter's growth drivers as 65-nm FPGAs and particularly 40-nm FPGAs are producing strong growth. As previously anticipated, revenues in all four vertical market segments are likely to be up sequentially.
The company will announce second quarter results after the market close on July 20, 2010.
