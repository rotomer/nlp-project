San Jose, Calif

July 24, 2012
 Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced second quarter sales of
$464.8 million
, up
21 percent
from the first quarter of 2012 and down
15 percent
from the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter net income was
$162.7 million
,
$0.50
per diluted share, compared with net income of
$115.8 million
,
$0.35
per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012 and
$214.6 million
,
$0.65
per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011.
Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was
$175.3 million
. Altera repurchased 3.5 million shares of its common stock during the quarter at a cost of $121.0 million. Altera ended the quarter with
$
3.5 billion
in cash and investments.
Altera's board of directors has increased the company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per share, up from the previous dividend of $0.08 per share. The board of directors has declared that the next quarterly dividend will be paid on September 4, 2012 to stockholders of record on August 10, 2012.
Altera's board of directors has approved a 10.0 million share increase to the number of shares authorized for repurchase under the company's share repurchase program. There are now 14.6 million shares authorized by the board of directors for repurchase. Under the program, which was previously authorized by the board of directors, shares may be purchased in the open market from time to time at the discretion of the company's management.
 
"New product revenue surged this quarter, as sales of both 28-nm and 40-nm accelerated strongly, driving the sharp revenue improvement from the prior quarter. Though growth was quite broad, the results in our Telecom and Wireless vertical market were particularly notable," said John Daane, president, chief executive officer, and chairman of the board. "Leading edge 28-nm FPGAs are creating more opportunities for us as we displace more ASICs and ASSPs. Our 28-nm competitive position remains strong. We estimate that to date we have secured the majority of available 28-nm FPGA design win value."
Several recent accomplishments mark the company's continuing progress:
