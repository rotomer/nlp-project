ALTERA UPDATES FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE GUIDANCE
ISSUES 2013 GUIDANCE
 
San Jose, Calif
., December 4, 2012 - Altera Corporation (NASDAQ: ALTR) today announced updated fourth quarter 2012 revenue guidance and key guidance elements for 2013.
The company currently expects that revenue for the fourth quarter will be 8 to 10 percent lower than third quarter levels. Prior guidance was for a decline of 6 to 10 percent. Sales of the company's new products are expected to grow sequentially but that growth will be more than offset by lower sales of the company's older products.
 
Fourth quarter results will be released after the market close on January 23, 2013.
