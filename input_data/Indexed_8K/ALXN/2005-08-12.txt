The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement, including a prospectus relating to the Shares, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The term "Registration Statement" means such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended to the date of this Agreement.

If the Company has filed or files an abbreviated registration statement to register additional shares of Common Stock pursuant to Rule 462(b) (the "Rule 462 Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), then any reference herein to the term "Registration Statement" shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement.

The term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus Supplement together with the Base Prospectus. The term "Preliminary Prospectus" means a preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Shares together with the Base Prospectus. As used herein, the terms "Base Prospectus," "Prospectus," "preliminary prospectus" and "Registration Statement" shall include in each case the documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein (it being understood that any statement contained in a document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Base Prospectus, preliminary prospectus, if any, Prospectus or Registration Statement shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof to the extent modified or superseded by a statement contained in any subsequently filed document which also is or is deemed to be incorporated by reference therein). The terms "supplement" and "amendment" or "amend" as used in this Agreement shall include all documents filed subsequent to the date of the Preliminary Prospectus, if any, or Prospectus, as the case may be, by the Company with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Prospectus.

Except as set forth in the Prospectus, the Company is not aware of any facts material to a determination of patentability regarding the Patent Applications not called to the attention of the PTO that would preclude the grant of a patent for the Patent Applications, has no knowledge of any facts which would adversely affect the Patent Applications not called to the attention of the PTO, and has secured with appropriate legal instruments clear title to all Patent Applications and other Intellectual Property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no third party is engaging in any activity that does or will infringe, misappropriate, violate or otherwise conflict with the Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Company or its subsidiaries, except as described in the Prospectus and except for such activities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(t) The financial statements of the Company (including all notes and schedules thereto) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Prospectus present fairly the financial position, the results of operations, the statements of cash flows and the statements of stockholders' equity and the other information purported to be shown therein of the Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates and for the respective periods to which they apply.
 
Such financial statements and related schedules and notes have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, and all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods have been made. The financial statements, together with the related notes and schedules, included in the Prospectus comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. No other financial statements or supporting schedules or exhibits are required by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder to be included in the Prospectus.
 
(u) Neither the Company nor any of its officers, directors or affiliates has taken or will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed or intended to stabilize or manipulate the price of any security of the Company, or which caused or resulted in, or which might in the future reasonably be expected to cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company.
 
(v) The Company and each of its subsidiaries maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

All policies of insurance and fidelity or surety bonds insuring the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Company's or its subsidiaries' respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are in full force and effect. The Company and each of its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and instruments in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company has reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company, taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary has been denied any insurance coverage which it has sought or for which it has applied.
 
(x) There are no rulemaking or similar proceedings before the FDA or comparable Federal, state, local or foreign government bodies which specifically involve the Company or, to the Company's knowledge, otherwise affect the Company or any subsidiary, which, if the subject of an action unfavorable to the Company or any subsidiary, could result in a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(aa) The Company has established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act); the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.
 
(bb) Since the date of the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2004, the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company (or persons fulfilling the equivalent function) have not been advised of (i) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data or any material weaknesses in internal controls; or (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls.

(x) the statements in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock", insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Shares, fairly summarize such provisions in all material respects;
 
(xi) to such counsel's knowledge, after due inquiry of the officers of the Company, but without having made any other investigation, there are no judicial, regulatory or other legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject that are required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and are not so described;
 
(xii) the Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

Such counsel shall also have furnished to the Underwriter a written statement addressed to the Underwriter and dated the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, to the effect that, in the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent accountants of the Company, representatives of the Underwriter and representatives of counsel for the Underwriter, at which the contents of the Prospectus and related matters were discussed, other than the documents incorporated by reference (although such counsel shall state that they have reviewed the documents incorporated by reference), and at which such counsel inquired of the representatives of the Company as to the materiality of the facts disclosed to such counsel and, although such counsel does not pass upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any statement contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and such counsel has made no independent check or verification thereof, based in part upon the foregoing (relying as to materiality in part upon the officers and representatives of the Company), no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have led them to believe that the Registration Statement (except as to the financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included therein as to which such counsel does not express any opinion or belief), as of the date of effectiveness, contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (except as to the financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data included therein or excluded therefrom as to which such counsel does not express any opinion or belief), as of its date or as of the date of the opinion, contained or contains an untrue statement of material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
(d) The Underwriter shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of the General Counsel or Associate General Counsel of the Company, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriter, to the effect that:

If we cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from the sale or development of our drugs," and (iii) the section of the Company's Annual Report, entitled "BUSINESS - Patents and Proprietary Rights" (collectively, the "Patent Language") are accurate in all material respects and insofar as such statements constitute summaries of legal matters, documents or proceedings, such statements fairly summarize in all material respects the matters referred to therein;
 
(iv) to such counsel's knowledge, Schedule I to such opinion provides a complete and accurate list of patents or patent applications that are owned or licensed by the Company, are directed to Pexelizumab and Eculizumab, and relate to compositions of material or indications for which there are ongoing clinical trials. To such counsel's knowledge, none of the Company's patents have lapsed or been abandoned, except where such lapse or abandonment would not have a material adverse affect on the Company;
 
(v) to such counsel's knowledge, other than the patents and patent applications identified on Schedule I to such opinion as being licensed to the Company, the Company is listed in the records of the U.S. Patent and trademark Office (PTO) as the assignee of each of the U.S. patents and patent applications listed on Schedule I to such opinion.

(vi) to such counsel's knowledge, each of the Company's patent applications listed on Schedule I to such opinion discloses patentable subject matter;

(viii) to such counsel's knowledge, except as disclosed in the Prospectus, no interests have been conveyed to third parties in the Company's patents or patent applications listed on Schedule I that have not been recorded in the PTO;
 
(ix) such counsel is not aware of any facts constituting a breach of the duty of candor to the PTO for any of the Company patents or patent applications listed on Schedule I to such opinion.

(x) to such counsel's knowledge, there is no prior art that would render any of the patents listed on Schedule I to such opinion invalid; and
 
(xi) based on such counsel's review of the third party patent rights of which such counsel is aware and discussions with Company personnel, except as disclosed in and contemplated by the Prospectus (including that some third parties have and may assert that the manufacture, use, or sale, of Pexeluzimab and Eculizumab could infringe their valid patent rights, and that our view that the manufacture, use, or sale, of Pexeluzimab and Eculizumab would not infringe any such valid patent rights may be wrong) such counsel is not aware of any facts that would lead him to conclude that the manufacture, use, or sale, of Pexeluzimab and Eculizumab for indications for which they are being developed would infringe valid patent rights of others .
 
The Underwriter shall have also received from the General Counsel or Associate General Counsel of the Company a written statement addressed to the Underwriter and dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriter, to the effect that, in the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, such counsel has participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent accountants of the Company, representatives of the Underwriter and representatives of counsel for the Underwriter, at which the contents of the Prospectus and related matters were discussed, and at which such counsel inquired of the representatives of the Company as to the materiality of the facts disclosed to such counsel and,
 
although such counsel does not pass upon, and does not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any statement contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and such counsel has made no independent check or verification thereof, based in part upon the foregoing, no facts have come to such counsel's attention that have led him to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the date of effectiveness, contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date of the opinion, contained or contains an untrue statement of material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
(e) The Underwriter shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for the Underwriter, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such matters as the Underwriter may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
 
(f) The Underwriter shall have received, on each of the date hereof and the Closing Date, a letter dated the date hereof or the Closing Date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter, from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants, containing (i) statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and (ii) with respect to the letter received on the Closing Date, a paragraph substantially the same as the paragraph set forth on Exhibit A hereto; provided that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off date" not earlier than the date hereof.

7.
Indemnity and Contribution.
 
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its officers, employees, representatives and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
 
(b) The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the
 
Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by the Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the
 
Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
(e) The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, any person controlling the Underwriter or any affiliate of the Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
8.
Termination.
 
(a) The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if, after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or state authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, individually or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
 
(b) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriter because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
 
9.
Acknowledgements.
 
(a) The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction the Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) the Underwriter has not assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriter has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
(b) This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriter with respect to the subject matter hereof.
 
(c) The Company and the Underwriter hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

EXHIBIT A
 
 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Underwriter a letter containing, among other things, a paragraph substantially the same as the following:
 
"Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to April 30, 2005 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after April 30, 2005 have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the interim quarterly periods. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether: (i) on the "cut-off date" there was any change in the capital stock or increase in long-term debt of the Company and subsidiaries consolidated as compared with amounts shown in the April 30, 2005 unaudited consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or (ii) for the period from May 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005, there were any increases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total operating expenses or net loss. On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in this letter, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change or increase, except in all instances for changes or increases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur and except as described in the following sentence. [disclose any necessary changes]

Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
1585 Broadway
New York, New York 10036
 
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
 
The undersigned understands that Morgan Stanley & Co.
