Any "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act relating to the Shares is hereinafter called an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus." As used herein, the terms "Base Prospectus," "Pricing Prospectus," "Prospectus," "Preliminary Prospectus" and "Registration Statement"

Except as set forth in the Pricing Prospectus, the Company is not aware of any facts material to a determination of patentability regarding the Patent Applications not called to the attention of the PTO that would preclude the grant of a patent for the Patent Applications, has no knowledge of any facts which would adversely affect the Patent Applications not called to the attention of the PTO, and has secured with appropriate legal instruments clear title to all Patent Applications and other Intellectual Property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no third party is engaging in any activity that does or will infringe, misappropriate, violate or otherwise conflict with the Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Company or its subsidiaries, except as described in the Pricing Prospectus and except for such activities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(w) The financial statements of the Company (including all notes and schedules thereto) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus and Prospectus present fairly the financial position, the results of operations, the statements of cash flows and the statements of stockholders' equity and the other information purported to be shown therein of the Company and its subsidiaries at the respective dates and for the respective periods to which they apply. Such financial statements and related schedules and notes have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied throughout the periods involved, and all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods have been made. The financial statements, together with the related notes and schedules, included in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. No other financial statements or supporting schedules or exhibits are required by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder to be included in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus.
(x) Neither the Company nor any of its officers, directors or affiliates has taken or will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed or intended to stabilize or manipulate the price of any security of the Company, or which caused or resulted in, or which might in the future reasonably be expected to cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company.

All policies of insurance and fidelity or surety bonds insuring the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the Company's or its subsidiaries' respective businesses, assets, employees, officers and directors are in full force and effect. The Company and each of its subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of such policies and instruments in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company has reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and when
 
such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not have a material adverse effect on the Company, taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any subsidiary has been denied any insurance coverage which it has sought or for which it has applied.
(aa) There are no rulemaking or similar proceedings before the FDA or comparable Federal, state, local or foreign government bodies which specifically involve the Company or, to the Company's knowledge, otherwise affect the Company or any subsidiary, which, if the subject of an action unfavorable to the Company or any subsidiary, could result in a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Company has taken no action designed to, or which is likely to have the effect of, terminating the registration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act or the quotation of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq, nor has the Company received any notification that the Commission or the Nasdaq is contemplating terminating such registration or quotation.
(dd) The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act); the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports; such "disclosure controls and procedures" were effective as of the end of the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
(ee) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) designed by the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or under their supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

6. . In further consideration of the Underwriters' agreements herein contained, the Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows:
Covenants of the Company

(b) To prepare the Prospectus in a form approved by you and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second business day following the date of this Agreement or such earlier time as may be required under the Securities Act. Before amending or supplementing the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, to furnish to you a copy of each such proposed amendment or supplement and not to file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you object after reasonable notice thereof, and to file with the Commission the Rule 462 Registration Statement and, within the applicable period specified in Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, any prospectus required to be filed pursuant to such Rule.

If, during such period after the first date of the public offering of the Shares as in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is required by law to be delivered in connection with sales by an underwriter or dealer, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to the dealers (whose names and addresses you will furnish to the Company) to which Shares may have been sold by you and to any other dealers upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with law.
 
(e) If by the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of the initial effective date of the Registration Statement, any of the Shares remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new shelf registration statement relating to the Shares, in a form satisfactory to you and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Shares to continue as contemplated in the expired registration statement relating to the Shares. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new automatic shelf registration statement or such new shelf registration statement, as the case may be.
(f) To endeavor to qualify the Shares for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now qualified or to take any action which would subject the Company to taxation or service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering and sale of the shares, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
(g) To make generally available to the Company's security holders and to you as soon as practicable an earning statement covering the twelve month period ending December 31, 2007 that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

certificates representing the Shares, (vii) the costs and charges of any transfer agent, registrar or depositary, (viii) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Shares, including, without limitation, expenses associated with the production of road show slides and graphics, fees and expenses of any consultants engaged in connection with the road show presentations with the prior approval of the Company, travel and lodging expenses of the representatives and officers of the Company and any such consultants, and the cost of any aircraft chartered in connection with the road show, (ix) the document production charges and expenses associated with printing this Agreement and (x) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section.

(i) To establish controls and procedures that will ensure that the Company's officers and directors that have executed the "lock-up" agreements referenced in Section 5(g) above will comply with the "lock up" restrictions described therein, and to furnish information to the Underwriters with respect to such transactions by the Company's directors and officers as the Underwriters may reasonably request.
(j) During the period of three years from the date hereof, the Company will deliver to the Underwriters, (i) as soon as they are available, copies of all reports or other communications furnished to shareholders and (ii) as soon as they are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished or filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act or any national securities exchange or automatic quotation system on which the Shares are listed or quoted.
(k) The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares as set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "Use of Proceeds."
7. .
Free Writing Prospectuses
(a) The Company represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co., it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute a free writing prospectus; any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. is listed on Schedule II(a) hereto.
(b) The Company has complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of Rule 433 under the Securities Act applicable to any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending.
 
(c) The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and, if requested by Goldman, Sachs, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission; provided, however, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions in an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
8. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers, employees, representatives and agents and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Base Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
 
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Goldman, Sachs & Co., in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is
 
appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by Goldman, Sachs & Co. to the Company, if, after the Applicable Time (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or state authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, individually or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus.
Termination
10. .
Defaulting Underwriters
(a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares which it has agreed to purchase hereunder on a Closing Date, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Closing Date for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Shares to be purchased on such Closing Date, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such Closing Date and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the number of Shares which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate number of such Shares which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate number of all the Shares to be purchased on such Closing Date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement (or, with respect to an Option Closing Date, the obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Optional Shares) shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6(h) hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(d) If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
11. .
Acknowledgements

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have furnished to the Underwriter a letter containing, among other things, a paragraph substantially the same as the following:
"Company officials have advised us that no consolidated financial data as of any date or for any period subsequent to , 2006 are available; accordingly, the procedures carried out by us with respect to changes in financial statement items after , 2006 have, of necessity, been even more limited than those with respect to the interim quarterly periods. We have inquired of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters as to whether: (i) on the "cut-off date" there was any change in the capital stock or increase in long-term debt of the Company and subsidiaries consolidated as compared with amounts shown in the , 2006 unaudited consolidated balance sheet incorporated by reference in the Prospectus or (ii) for the period from , 2006 through , 2006, there were any increases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total operating expenses or net loss. On the basis of these inquiries and our reading of the minutes as described in this letter, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that there was any such change or increase, except in all instances for changes or increases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur and except as described in the following sentence.

Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
The undersigned understands that Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman, Sachs" or the "Underwriter") proposes to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), providing for the public offering (the "Public Offering") of shares (the "Shares") of the Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock").
            
To induce the Underwriter to continue its efforts in connection with the Public Offering, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 60 days after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Public Offering (the "Prospectus"), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise.
