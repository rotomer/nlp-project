On July 18, 2007, Alexion Manufacturing LLC, or Alexion Manufacturing, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alexion, amended its mortgage loan agreement with iStar Financial Inc. to increase the loan amount by $18,000,000, resulting in an aggregate principal balance of $44,000,000. The mortgage loan is evidenced by an amended and restated promissory note and all obligations under the loan continue to be guaranteed by Alexion to the extent described in the agreements. In connection with the mortgage loan amendment, Alexion Manufacturing amended the Construction Mortgage Deed, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement and Fixture Filing, which granted the lender a security interest in the facility and the inventory, accounts and other property of Alexion Manufacturing, to reflect the increased loan amount.
From the effective date of the amendment, the mortgage loan bears interest at a new fixed annual rate of 9.12%, and in the event of default, the rate increases to 14.12%. Interest-only payments continue to be due monthly and the loan principal plus interest payments are due in equal installments of approximately $489,000 commencing March 2010 through August 2017, at which time all outstanding balances are due. The proceeds of the loan shall be used to finance the on-going construction of Alexion's Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility and for other general corporate purposes.
The other material terms and conditions of the original loan remain in force and effect as described in Alexion's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
