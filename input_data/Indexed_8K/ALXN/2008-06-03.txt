Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously reported by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SB2, Inc. filed a civil action against Alexion on January 31, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging willful infringement by Alexion of SB2 patents due to sales of Soliris. Alexion believes it has good and valid defenses against SB2's claims, which it presented to SB2.
On May 29, 2008, SB2 voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice, meaning the action may be re-filed. Alexion remains prepared to vigorously defend against any such claims if SB2 chooses to re-file.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
