The additional shares are expected to be distributed after the close of business on May 20, 2011 and reporting of the Alexion share price on a split-adjusted basis will commence on May 23, 2011. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
(b)    On May 10, 2011, the Board of Directors of Alexion adopted stock ownership guidelines for its officers and directors. Under the guidelines, directors are required to own shares with a value equal to four times (4x) the annual director retainer. Alexion's officers are required to own shares with a value equal to a specific multiple of such officer's base salary as indicated in the table below. Shares owned by the individual, unvested restricted stock and unvested restricted stock units count towards the ownership goal. Directors and officers are required to meet these guidelines within five years of becoming subject to them.
