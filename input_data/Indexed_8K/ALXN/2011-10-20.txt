On October 19, 2011, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. received notice that the European Patent Office (EPO) has rejected the opposition filed by Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. in August 2010 to Alexion's European Patent 0758904 (EP 0758904). The EPO concluded that EP 0758904 as originally granted meets the requirements of the European Patent Convention; and following this rejection of the opposition the claims of the patent as originally issued by the EPO in November 2009 remain unchanged, valid and in force.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
