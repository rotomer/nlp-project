Fourth Quarter 2011 Financial Highlights:
 
 
 
Full-Year 2011 Financial Highlights:
 
 
 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. For the three months ended December 31, 2011, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Alexion" or the "Company") reported net product sales of Soliris (eculizumab) of $227.6 million, compared to $156.0 million for the same period in 2010. The year-on-year increase of 45 percent resulted primarily from strong additions of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) globally, with a small contribution from the US launch of Soliris in atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) during the last months of 2011.
CHESHIRE, Conn., February 9, 2012
Soliris was approved for patients with PNH in the US (2007), European Union (2007), Japan (2010) and other territories as the first and only treatment indicated for this ultra-rare, debilitating and life-threatening blood disease. In addition, in 2011, Soliris was approved as the first and only treatment for patients with aHUS in the US (September 2011) and European Union (November 2011). aHUS is an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic disease.
Alexion's non-GAAP operating results are equal to GAAP operating results adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation, taxes that are not payable in cash (non-cash tax adjustment), amortization of acquired intangible assets, and costs associated with acquisitions. The non-cash tax adjustment represents the reduction in cash taxes attributable to the utilization of US net operating losses. The following summary table is provided for investors' convenience:

Fourth Quarter Non-GAAP Financial Results:
The Company reported non-GAAP net income of $80.5 million, or $0.41 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to non-GAAP net income of $48.6 million, or $0.26 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.

Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for Q4 2011 were $79.1 million, compared to $57.4 million for Q4 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflected Alexion's growing global operations for PNH and aHUS.

Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for 2011 were $275.5 million, compared to $203.7 million in 2010. The increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflected Alexion's growing global operations.

GAAP R&D expenses for 2011 were $137.4 million, compared to $98.4 million in 2010. GAAP SG&A expenses were $308.2 million in 2011, compared to $226.8 million for the prior year.
Balance Sheet:
As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $540.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to $361.6 million at December 31, 2010. The year-end 2011 cash balance does not reflect the purchase price for the Company's Enobia acquisition, which closed February 7, 2012 and was paid for with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the Company's new debt facility, and will be reflected in Alexion's Q1 2012 results.
"Following strong performance in our major global initiatives in 2011, we enter 2012 with the broadest commercial platform and the most robust development pipeline in Alexion's history," said Leonard Bell, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alexion. "Throughout 2012, we will focus on reaching more patients with PNH and serving the first patients with aHUS in the US and Europe. At the same time, we will accelerate our investigation of Soliris and four additional highly innovative compounds across eight severe and ultra-rare indications."
Global Commercial Operations:
PNH
During Q4 2011, a substantial number of new patients with PNH were started on Soliris therapy in Alexion's core territories of the US, Western Europe and Japan. Patients with PNH in Australia and Canada, as well as in various other nations of Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are also receiving Soliris.
aHUS
Soliris was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September and by the European Commission in November as the first treatment for patients with aHUS. Following the US approval, Alexion began serving patients in the US during Q4. The EU approval will enable Alexion to begin serving patients in initial European countries in 2012.
Research and Development Progress:
Alexion currently has development programs underway with its five highly innovative compounds: eculizumab (Soliris) and four additional novel drugs beyond eculizumab that have the potential to become first-in-class therapies for patients with other severe and ultra-rare disorders.
Eculizumab Programs
 
Enrollment has commenced in a Company-sponsored multi-national living-donor kidney transplant trial in patients at elevated risk of AHR.
 
Programs with eculizumab are ongoing in two severe and ultra-rare neurologic disorders, Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and Myasthenia Gravis (MG). Data from the investigator initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of eculizumab in severe refractory NMO are expected in 2012. As previously announced, data from the Company's Phase 2 study in MG were presented in the fall of 2011.
Ultra-Rare Disease Programs With Highly Innovative Compounds Beyond Eculizumab
 
Asfotase alfa is an innovative, first-in-class targeted enzyme replacement therapy in Phase 2 clinical trials for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP), an ultra-rare, genetic, and life-threatening metabolic disease with no effective treatment options.
Alexion is accelerating the development of a cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A, an ultra-rare, genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns. The Company is currently conducting IND enabling studies.
 
Alexion is now enrolling patients in a Phase I study to characterize the mechanism of action of TT30, a unique inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, and to develop initial safety data.
 
A Phase I study of ALXN1007, an innovative anti-inflammatory antibody, is underway to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this compound in healthy volunteers.
2012 Financial Guidance:
In 2012, worldwide net product sales are expected to be within a range of $1.04 to $1.07 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expenses are anticipated to be in the range of $220 to $230 million, and SG&A expenses in the range of $345 to $355 million, which excludes $20 to $25 million in Enobia acquisition-related costs. The Company's share-based compensation expense for the year is expected to be in a range of $50 to $52 million. Cost of sales is expected to be approximately 12 percent of net product sales. Excluding the tax impact of the integration and structuring of the Enobia acquisition, that Alexion will undertake throughout 2012, the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 32 to 34 percent. The non-GAAP effective tax rate, reported on a cash tax liability basis, is expected to be in the range of 8 to 10 percent. Based on a forecast of approximately 197 million diluted shares outstanding, Alexion is providing guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 for non-GAAP earnings per share for the year.

About Soliris:
Soliris is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor developed from the laboratory through regulatory approval and commercialization by Alexion. Soliris is approved in the US, European Union, Japan and other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Soliris is also approved in the US and the European Union as the first and only treatment for patients with atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA (blood clots in small vessels). Soliris is indicated to inhibit complement-mediated TMA. The effectiveness of Soliris in aHUS is based on the effects on TMA and renal function. Prospective clinical trials in additional patients are ongoing to confirm the benefit of Soliris in patients with aHUS. Soliris is not indicated for the treatment of patients with Shiga toxin E. coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). Alexion's breakthrough approach in complement inhibition has received the pharmaceutical industry's highest honors: the 2008 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product with broad implications for future biomedical research and the 2009 Prix Galien France Award in the category of Drugs for Rare Diseases. More information including the full prescribing information on Soliris is available at www.soliris.net.
