-- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) (Alexion or the Company) today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012. Alexion reported net product sales of Soliris
(eculizumab) of $274.7 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared to $185.7 million for the same period in 2011.
#PageNum#
Revenue performance for the quarter reflected steady additions of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) commencing Soliris therapy in Alexion's core territories of the US, Western Europe and Japan, as well as in new countries. Revenues were further augmented by an increasing number of new patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) commencing Soliris treatment, as well as by $3.3 million from shipments of Soliris that occurred in 2011.
Soliris is approved for patients with PNH in the US (2007), European Union (2007), Japan (2010) and other territories as the first and only treatment indicated for this ultra-rare, debilitating and life-threatening blood disease. Soliris is also approved as the first and only treatment for patients with aHUS, an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic disease, in the US (September 2011) and in the European Union (November 2011).
Alexion's non-GAAP operating results are equal to GAAP operating results adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation, costs associated with acquisitions, taxes that are not payable in cash (non-cash taxes) attributable to the utilization of US net operating losses, and taxes related to acquisition structuring. The following summary table is provided for investors' convenience:

We also advanced our eight lead development programs which include five highly innovative biologics.

Alexion today announced that it is raising its 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1.065 to $1.085 billion now to the higher range of $1.110 to $1.125 billion.

Shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 203 million in the third quarter and approximately 204 million in the fourth quarter.

About Soliris:
#PageNum#
Soliris is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor developed from the laboratory through regulatory approval and commercialization by Alexion. Soliris is approved in the US, European Union, Japan and other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Soliris is indicated to reduce hemolysis. Soliris is also approved in the US and the European Union as the first and only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA (blood clots in small vessels). Soliris is indicated to inhibit complement-mediated TMA. The effectiveness of Soliris in aHUS is based on the effects on TMA and renal function. Prospective clinical trials in additional patients are ongoing to confirm the benefit of Soliris in patients with aHUS. Soliris is not indicated for the treatment of patients with Shiga toxin
E. coli
related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). For the breakthrough innovation in complement inhibition, Alexion and Soliris have received the pharmaceutical industry's highest honors: the 2008 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product with broad implications for future biomedical research and the 2009 Prix Galien France Award in the category of Drugs for Rare Diseases. More information including the full prescribing information on Soliris is available at www.soliris.net.
