Third Quarter 2012 Financial Highlights:
CHESHIRE, Conn., October 24, 2012
-- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALXN) (Alexion or the Company) today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012. Alexion reported net product sales of Soliris
(eculizumab) of $294.1 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared to $204.0 million for the same period in 2011.
Revenue performance for the quarter reflected steady additions of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) commencing Soliris therapy in Alexion's core territories of the US, Western Europe and Japan, as well as in new countries. Revenues were further augmented by an increasing number of new patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) commencing Soliris treatment.
1
Soliris is approved for patients with PNH in the US (2007), European Union (2007), Japan (2010) and other territories as the first and only treatment indicated for patients with this ultra-rare, debilitating and life-threatening blood disease. Soliris is also approved in the US (September 2011) and in the European Union (November 2011) as the first and only treatment for patients with aHUS, an ultra-rare life-threatening genetic disease.
Alexion's non-GAAP operating results are equal to GAAP operating results adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation, costs associated with acquisitions, taxes that are not payable in cash, taxes related to acquisition structuring, impact of intellectual property settlements and intangible asset impairments. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP results is included later in this press release.
Third Quarter 2012 Non-GAAP Financial Results:
The Company reported non-GAAP net income of $120.7 million, or $0.60 per share, in the third quarter of 2012, compared to non-GAAP net income of $72.6 million, or $0.37 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.
As noted above, non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2012 excludes the $0.13 per share net benefit attributable to the intellectual property settlement and intangible asset impairment that occurred in Q3 2012. Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2011 excludes the $0.09 per share benefit attributable to tax credits.
Alexion's non-GAAP operating expenses for Q3 2012 were $130.9 million, compared to $103.5 million for Q3 2011. Non-GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses for Q3 2012 were $50.6 million, compared to $34.1 million for Q3 2011. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for Q3 2012 were $80.3 million, compared to $69.5 million for Q3 2011.
Third Quarter 2012 GAAP Financial Results:
Alexion reported GAAP net income of $92.2 million, or $0.46 per share, in the third quarter of 2012, compared to GAAP net income of $65.6 million, or $0.34 per share, in the third quarter of 2011.
On a GAAP basis, operating expenses for Q3 2012 were $171.6 million, compared to $114.5 million for Q3 2011. GAAP R&D expenses for Q3 2012 were $54.3 million, compared to $36.6 million for Q3 2011. GAAP SG&A expenses were $90.0 million for Q3 2012, compared to $77.6 million for Q3 2011. Q3 2012 GAAP results were negatively impacted by a $26.3 million impairment of an intangible asset related to a previously acquired pre-clinical age-related macular degeneration (AMD) program. Q3 2012 GAAP results were positively impacted by the terms of a patent settlement and license agreement, for which the Company recognized a gain of $53.4 million in cost of sales, net of the effect of an upfront payment. During Q3 2011, the Company recorded a GAAP tax benefit from the impact of tax credits of $16.3 million.
Balance Sheet:
As of September 30, 2012, the Company had $905.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $806.2 million at June 30, 2012. The Company also reduced total debt to $161.0 million at September 30, 2012 from $228.0 million at June 30, 2012.
In the third quarter, a substantial number of new patients with PNH started on Soliris in our core territories and new countries, while Soliris therapy also commenced for a growing number of
2
new patients with aHUS, said Leonard Bell, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alexion. In the final quarter of 2012, we will drive to serve an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS while accelerating our eight lead development programs with five highly innovative theraputic candidates. Our steadfast focus across our global organization will continue to bring life-transforming innovation to more patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.
Research and Development Programs:
    
Alexion currently has lead development programs underway with five highly innovative therapeutics, including eculizumab (Soliris), which are being investigated across eight severe and ultra-rare disorders beyond PNH and aHUS.

2012 Financial Guidance:
Alexion today announced that it is raising its 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1.110 to $1.125 billion, now to the higher and narrower range of $1.120 to $1.130 billion. The upward revision reflects continued global growth of Soliris in PNH and growth from the ongoing launch of Soliris in aHUS. 2012 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A is being decreased from the previous range of $360 to $370 million, now to $345 to $355 million. 2012 non-GAAP R&D guidance is being reduced from the previous range of $220 to $230 million, now to the lower range of $210 to $220 million. 2012 guidance for cost of sales is being reduced from approximately 12 percent to approximately 11 percent. Guidance for the Company's non-GAAP tax rate is being reduced from the previous range of 8 to 10 percent, now to the lower and narrower range of 7 to 8 percent. Guidance for 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share is being raised, from the previous range of $1.78 to $1.88 per share, now to the higher and narrower range of $1.99 to $2.04 per share. Shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 204 million in the fourth quarter and 201 million for the full year.

About Soliris:
Soliris is a first-in-class terminal complement inhibitor developed from the laboratory through regulatory approval and commercialization by Alexion. Soliris is approved in the US, European Union, Japan and other countries as the first and only treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening blood disorder, characterized by complement-mediated hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). Soliris is indicated to reduce hemolysis. Soliris is also approved in the US and the European Union as the first and only treatment for patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a debilitating, ultra-rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA (blood clots in small vessels). Soliris is indicated to inhibit complement-mediated TMA. The effectiveness of Soliris in aHUS is based on the effects on TMA and renal function. Prospective clinical trials in additional patients are ongoing to confirm the benefit of Soliris in patients with aHUS. Soliris is not indicated for the treatment of patients with Shiga toxin
E. coli
related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). For the breakthrough innovation in complement inhibition, Alexion and Soliris have received the pharmaceutical industry's highest honors: the 2008 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product with broad implications for future biomedical research and the 2009 Prix Galien France Award in the category of Drugs for Rare Diseases.

Alexion does not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, except when a duty arises under law.
