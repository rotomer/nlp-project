On May 13, 2003, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied Materials") announced its financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2003. A copy of Applied Materials' press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit is being furnished pursuant to "Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in accordance with interim guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Release No.33-8216. The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied Materials, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Priniciples ("GAAP"), Applied Materials uses a pro forma measure of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude costs of the 2003 Realignment Plan (the "Plan"). Due to the amount of costs incurred with the Plan, Applied Materials believes that the use of pro forma measure facilitates meaningful comparison with prior periods. Applied Materials believes that pro forma net income reports baseline performance before costs of the Plan. In addition, pro forma net income is the primary indicator management uses to plan and forecast future periods. These measures are not in accordance with, or are an alternative for GAAP, and may be materially different from pro forma methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Pro forma net income is computed by adjusting GAAP net income with the impact of restructuring and realignment activities. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of reported results under GAAP to the pro forma amounts have been included as a supplement to the press release.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned therunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Release: Immediate
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 13, 2003 -- Applied Materials, Inc., the world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication solutions to the semiconductor industry, reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended April 27, 2003. Net sales were $1.11 billion, up five percent from $1.05 billion from the first fiscal quarter of 2003, and down four percent from $1.16 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2002. The net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 was $62 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to a loss of $66 million, or $0.04 per share, for the first fiscal quarter of 2003, and down from net income of $52 million, or $0.03 per share reported for the second fiscal quarter of 2002. The initiation of the 2003 Realignment Plan (the "Plan") resulted in the reported net loss for the second fiscal quarter of 2003.
Gross margin for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 was 33.7 percent, down from 37.0 percent for the first fiscal quarter of 2003 and 40.0 percent for the second fiscal quarter of 2002.
On March 17, 2003, Applied Materials announced the Plan to realign the company's infrastructure with current business conditions. The Plan consists of two major elements: first, restructuring actions (including consolidation of facilities and a reduction in work force); and second, refocused product development and cost reduction programs. Both parts of the Plan will result in charges to income across multiple categories, as incurred. During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, the company began implementing the Plan, resulting in charges of $151.7 million. If the charges under the Plan had been excluded from the results reported above, the company would have reported gross margin of 38.1 percent and $44.8 million of net income or $0.03 per share on an ongoing basis.
New orders of $971 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 decreased four percent from $1.02 billion from the first fiscal quarter of 2003, and decreased 42 percent from $1.69 billion for the second fiscal quarter of 2002. Regional distribution of new orders for the second fiscal quarter of 2003 was: Japan 28 percent, Europe 25 percent, North America 23 percent, Korea 12 percent, Taiwan seven percent, and Southeast Asia and China five percent. Backlog at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2003 decreased to $2.76 billion from $3.05 billion at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2003.
"We achieved our financial objectives for the second fiscal quarter despite challenging market conditions," said James C. Morgan, chairman of Applied Materials. "We believe that the Plan, which began during the quarter, will improve the company's cost structure and enable greater strategic focus on partnering with our customers to address their technology challenges as they move to 300mm wafers, smaller chip design geometries, and new materials.
"Semiconductor manufacturers remain cautious but continue to invest in advanced technologies, as they balance their need to develop the most advanced process capabilities with the uncertainties in the global economy and the impact of near-term weakness in chip demand. We believe that Applied Materials' strategic investment in product and service solutions, as well as our process integration expertise, strongly position the company for growth as the economy and capital spending levels improve.
"With the addition of Mike Splinter, as president and CEO, I am confident that our seasoned management team, together with our technological capabilities, global infrastructure and financial strength, uniquely position Applied Materials to rapidly respond to the opportunities ahead."
Reconciliations of reported results of operations under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to the pro forma amounts have been included as a supplement to this press release. Due to the amount of costs incurred with realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that reconciliation to ongoing operations facilitates meaningful comparison with prior periods. To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared under GAAP, the company uses a pro forma measure of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude costs of the Plan. The company believes that pro forma net income reports baseline performance before costs of the Plan. In addition, pro forma net income is the primary indicator management uses to plan and forecast future periods. These measures are not in accordance with, or are an alternative for GAAP, and may be materially different from pro forma methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Pro forma net income is computed by adjusting GAAP net income with the impact of restructuring and realignment activities. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP.
