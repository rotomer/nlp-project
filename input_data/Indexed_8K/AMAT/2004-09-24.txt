Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 20, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") entered into a Binding Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") with Novellus Systems, Inc. ("Novellus"). The MOU effects a full settlement of lawsuits for patent infringement pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case Nos. C-97-20523-RMW and C-97-20551-RMW, without either party admitting any liability. The MOU provides for Applied to pay $8 million to Novellus by September 24, 2004, and to waive approximately $3.5 million that Applied claimed was owed under a 1997 settlement agreement between the parties. In addition, patent licenses previously granted by each of Novellus and Applied in the prior settlement agreement become fully paid up, as well as revocable only in limited circumstances.
 
The MOU contains additional covenants and restrictions, which in general establish a structure that is expected to help avoid patent infringement lawsuits in the future. The MOU limits the ability of each party (including subsidiaries and permitted successors and assigns) to sue the other, and the other's customers and (with some exceptions) suppliers and distributors, for infringement of any of the parties' respective patents covering products in technology areas in which both parties engaged in business as of September 3, 2004 (the "effective date"), as follows: (i) for a period of five years from the effective date of the MOU as to existing products, and (ii) for a period of two years from the effective date (with the possibility to extend for an additional year) as to new products introduced after the effective date (the "covenants not to sue"). The following technology areas are expressly covered by the covenants not to sue: integrated anneal, CVD (chemical vapor deposition), PVD (physical vapor deposition), PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition), HDP-PECVD (high density plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, ALD (atomic layer deposition), ECD (electrochemical deposition) and, with some exceptions, CMP (chemical mechanical polishing). Technology areas in which neither party or only one party engaged in business as of the effective date are specifically excluded from the covenants not to sue (the "excluded product areas"), including stand-alone wet-clean, ion implant, flat panel display processes and production equipment, stand-alone metrology and optical or e-beam inspection of wafers or masks, mask writing, photoresist strip, etch, epitaxial deposition, and RTP (rapid thermal processing).
 
The parties further agreed to notice and cure periods prior to filing suit on products subject to a covenant not to sue that has expired. No damages for infringement will accrue during the covenant not to sue and cure periods. The MOU permits each party to continue to provide support (including certain replacement parts and consumables) to customers for products (other than those in excluded product areas) sold during any covenant not to sue or cure period. The MOU contains other conditions pertaining to, and requiring binding arbitration of, claims regarding certain consumables and replacement parts (other than those in excluded product areas). The MOU does not confer any rights or benefits upon any person or entity not a party to the MOU.
 
The MOU contains a general release of all claims arising prior to the effective date that either Applied or Novellus may have had against the other and the other's customers and (with some exceptions) suppliers and distributors, relating to infringement of the party's patents by any of the other party's products (other than those in excluded product areas). Trial on the liability portion of Novellus' lawsuit had been scheduled to begin on September 20, 2004. For additional information regarding the history of these lawsuits,
please refer to the "Legal Proceedings" section of Applied's most recent reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.

Party
Parties"
 
B. The Parties intend to enter into a definitive agreement implementing this MOU (the "") as soon as practicable, and no later than the close of business on September 24, 2004, unless an extension is agreed to by both Parties in writing, with the understanding that if a Definitive Agreement is not entered into by that date, this MOU shall be and remain legally binding between the Parties. If a Definitive Agreement is reached, it shall extinguish and supersede this MOU.

For the avoidance of doubt, products, processes, Consumables, or tools (and features incorporated in the foregoing) owned by Subsidiaries not "controlled" (as defined in the definition of Subsidiary) by a Party as of the Effective Date shall not be Existing Products.
bona fide
 
"" or "" means all forms of patent infringement, including direct infringement, indirect infringement, contributory infringement and inducing infringement.
Infringe

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this MOU as of the Effective Date.
 
 
 
 
 
Section 1.
 
(a) No Party may assign any of its rights under this MOU, or delegate any performance of its obligations under this MOU, except with the prior written consent of the other Party, which it may give or withhold in its sole discretion (subject to the balance of this Section 1). All assignments of rights and delegations of obligations are prohibited under this subsection, whether they are voluntary or involuntary, by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law or any other manner. For purposes of this Section 1, a "change of control" (as defined below) is deemed an assignment of rights and a delegation of performance of obligations, and a "merger" refers to any merger in which a Party participates, whether or not it is the surviving or disappearing corporation. Any purported assignment of rights or delegation of performance in violation of this Section 1 is void.
 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 1(a), either Party hereto may assign its rights and delegate its performance of obligations under this MOU, without the prior written consent of the other Party, if such Party experiences a "change of control" (as hereinafter defined) and the other conditions set forth in this Section 1 are fulfilled. For purposes of this MOU, a change of control of a Party shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as: (i) any person or entity (or "group" of persons or entities, as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) shall have acquired (whether by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation, other corporate transaction, purchase or in any other manner) beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13(d)-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of securities of the applicable Party (or other securities convertible into such securities) representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of all outstanding securities of such Party entitled to vote in the election of directors; or (ii) any person or entity (or "group" of persons or entities, as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) shall have acquired all or substantially all of the assets of a Party.
 
(c) The "other conditions" referred to in Section 1(b) above are that: (a) the acquiring person, entity or group in the change of control (the "") expressly agrees in writing to be bound by each and every term and condition of this MOU, and be liable for each and every liability and obligation of the acquired Party hereunder, and (b) the Acquiror provides written notice to the other Party of the fact of the acquisition and the identity of the Acquiror within five (5) business days of the closing of any such change of control. If an assignment of rights is permitted and occurs pursuant to this Section 1, a contemporaneous delegation is deemed to have occurred and the assignee is deemed to have assumed the assignor's performance obligations in favor of the nonassigning party, but without releasing the assigning party of any obligations or liabilities hereunder.
Acquiror
 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights and obligations set forth in this MOU will not be assignable by either Party as a debtor-in-possession, or by a bankruptcy trustee or receiver, to any third party in connection with any proceeding under applicable bankruptcy law.
 
(e) Assuming the "other conditions" referred to above are complied with, if, in addition, an Acquiror expressly agrees in a writing delivered to all Parties prior to the consummation of the change of control that that the definition of the term "Patents" in this MOU shall include all of the Acquiror's and its Subsidiaries' existing and future Patents (a ""), then, upon the consummation of the change of control, the Acquiror shall be entitled to assert the protections of this MOU, subject to all limitations herein, as if it were the Party being acquired, other than Paragraph 5 ("5-Year Covenant Not to Sue For Existing Products") and any associated Cure Period provisions, it being understood that the products, processes, Consumables, or tools (and features incorporated in the foregoing) of the Acquiror shall, in this case, be deemed New Products. For example, in such case all of the Acquiror's products shall be protected as if they were a Party's New Products, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations herein. If the Acquiror does not give a Patent Undertaking, then, assuming the "other conditions" referred to above are complied with, upon the consummation of the change of control, the definition of the terms "Patents", "Existing Products" and "New Products" shall thereafter be deemed to include solely those Patents, Existing Products and New Products which, immediately prior to the change of control, the Party acquired by the Acquiror would then properly be bound by or could properly assert. For example, although the Acquiror will be able to assert the benefits of this MOU as to the Existing Products and New Products of the Party that it acquired, as they existed immediately prior to the change of control, it shall not be entitled to assert this MOU as to its own products; nor will it be obligated to observe the restrictions herein as to its own Patents; , , that to the extent either Existing Products or New Products of the Party acquired, as they existed immediately prior to the change of control, are re-sold, without substantial modification, by the Acquiror (regardless of the name under which they are sold), or are included, without substantial modification, into a product suite of the Acquiror, then such Existing Products and New Products shall continue to be entitled to the protections of this MOU. Nothing in this Section 1(e) shall affect any disputes or legal actions in effect by a Party against an Acquiror prior to the date of the change of control.
Patent Undertaking
provided
however
 
Section 2. The Parties, and each of them, represent and warrant to the other that: they have the corporate power and authority to enter into this MOU; this MOU has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Party, including the releases and covenants contained herein, and that they and their counsel have the authority to execute and file the stipulated dismissal referred to in Paragraph 2 of this MOU; that the execution, delivery and performance of this MOU does not and will not violate or breach (a) the article of incorporation or bylaws of such Party, or (b) any contract, agreement, judgment, order or decree applicable to, or which binds, such Party; that this MOU constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of each of them, enforceable in accordance with its terms this MOU shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries, divisions, officers, directors, employees,
 
agents, attorneys, legal representatives, and (to the extent permitted by Section 1) successors, and assigns; they have not transferred or assigned or purported to transfer or assign any of the claims, causes of action, demands, costs, obligations, damages, or liabilities being released under this MOU, and each party agrees to indemnify the other from and against any claim based upon, connected with, or arising out of any such assignment or transfer or purported assignment or transfer.
 
Section 3. Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms and provisions of this MOU and the negotiations and communications leading to it are confidential and shall not be disclosed by any Party to anyone other than counsel for such Party. The foregoing notwithstanding, each Party may (a) disclose to third parties only the fact that the Parties have settled and dismissed the above-referenced litigations with prejudice and that each Party is to bear its own costs and fees; (b) disclose this MOU and its terms to a third party in connection with a financing, merger or acquisition, or stock offering; provided, that, except for portions of this MOU that have been disclosed publicly in compliance with this Section 3, the Party seeking to disclose this MOU shall use [****] MOU in connection with such transaction to agree to a confidentiality agreement covering this MOU [****], it being understood that [****] regarding any disclosure pursuant to this clause (b) or to provide copies of a confidentiality agreement referred to herein, if one is entered into, nor will the [****] for failure to obtain the aforementioned confidentiality agreement; (c) make such disclosures of this MOU and its terms as are mutually agreed upon by all Parties in writing; (d) make such disclosure of this MOU and its terms as are required under Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations; (e) issue a press release in form and substance agreeable to them mutually; and (f) make such other disclosure of the MOU and its terms as are required by law, that (A) with respect to clause (d), it is understood that each Party [****] and that each Party shall [****] provided by the other Party [****], including [****] regarding the content of the disclosure required and whether [****], it being understood that neither Party is [****], and (B) respect solely to this clause (f), the Party required to make the disclosure shall notify all other Party at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any such disclosure, shall allow the other Party to intervene in any proceeding (at such other Parties' own cost and expense, in a reasonable manner, and in consultation with all Parties hereto) to protect the confidentiality of this MOU and its terms, and shall undertake reasonable efforts ([****] that would reasonably result in [****]) to require the continued confidentiality of this MOU and its terms (for example, by requesting that [****]). Notwithstanding the foregoing, all portions of this MOU that have been publicly disclosed in compliance with this Section 3 shall no longer be subject to the limitations on disclosure in this Section 3.
provided
 
 
Section 4. This MOU and the dismissals, as well as the fact that the Parties have entered into this MOU and the dismissals, shall not be admissible against either Party for any purpose in any future litigation between the Parties except to enforce the terms of the MOU. Nothing herein shall be construed as an admission of liability on the part of any Party hereto. In addition, neither Party shall assert that compliance with this MOU or any Definitive Agreement supports in any way a defense of estoppel, laches, or similar defenses; , , that nothing herein shall be deemed to toll any Patent statute of limitations that is otherwise applicable. Any determination of as to Infringement, validity or enforceability of a Patent pursuant to the royalty arbitration provided for in Paragraph 9 of this MOU, and any royalties paid pursuant thereto, shall not have legal effect (whether by way of claim or issue preclusion or otherwise) in any court proceeding that may arise in connection with the Patents at issue in the arbitration.
provided
however
 
Section 5. Any legal action relating to or arising out of this MOU, and all other Patent Infringement or other legal disputes or claims (whether or not related to Patents or covered by this MOU) between the Parties shall be commenced and maintained in the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, unless subject matter jurisdiction does not lie in such court, in which case all such legal actions, disputes or claims shall be commenced and maintained in the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, San Jose, California. The parties hereto consent to the jurisdiction of said court, as applicable, and to service of process outside of the State of California pursuant to the requirement of such court in any matter subject to it. This MOU shall be deemed to have been entered into in the State of California and shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreement executed and to be performed therein by each party (and without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions of such state).

Section 7. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this MOU were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, except where injunctive relief is expressly prohibited by this MOU, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this MOU and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court permitted by Section 5, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Release:  Immediate
 
 
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., September 24, 2004  Applied Materials, Inc. today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Novellus Systems, Inc. to dismiss all pending lawsuits between the companies involving allegations of patent infringement and to establish a structure that is expected to help avoid patent infringement lawsuits in the future.
 
"This agreement produces a positive result for both companies and demonstrates strong motivation not to infringe each other's patents," said Joseph J. Sweeney, Group Vice President, Legal Affairs and Intellectual Property, and Corporate Secretary. "By putting these legal matters behind us, Applied Materials is able to better focus on customer requirements and to compete in the market based on the merits of our products and technology."
 
The agreement provides for a payment to Novellus of $8 million and waives a claim for unpaid royalties of approximately $3.5 million. The agreement also contains provisions limiting for specified time periods each party's ability to sue each other (and each other's customers and, in certain circumstances, suppliers and distributors) for infringement of their respective patents covering products in certain technology areas. For existing products, the specified time period is five years, and for new products, it is two years. There is no new license of technology in the agreement. The agreement ends all pending lawsuits between the companies without either party admitting any liability. Additional details of the agreement are disclosed in Applied Materials' Form 8-K filed today.
 
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the avoidance of future patent infringement lawsuits and other effects of the agreement. These forward-looking statements can be identified by use of such words as "expect," are based on management's assessments as of the date hereof, and include the assumptions that underlie such assessments.
