Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 17, 2004, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied Materials") announced its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter and the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. A copy of Applied Materials' press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied Materials, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference in such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the consolidated condensed financial statements prepared under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), Applied Materials uses a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude special items. Reconciliations of reported results of operations under GAAP to ongoing results are included as a supplement to the press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred in prior periods as a result of realignment activities, Applied Materials believes that ongoing results are useful to investors because they reflect baseline performance exclusive of charges associated with realignment activities. Ongoing results are the primary indicator used by Applied Materials' management to plan and forecast future periods. These non-GAAP measures are neither in accordance with, nor an alternative for, GAAP, and may be materially different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Net sales were $2.20 billion, down 1 percent from $2.24 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and up 80 percent from $1.22 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Gross margin for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was 46.6 percent, down from 47.4 percent for the third fiscal quarter of 2004 and up from 40.5 percent for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Net income for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was $455 million, or $0.27 per share, up from net income of $441 million, or $0.26 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and up from net income of $15 million, or $0.01 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. The results of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 include litigation settlements and a favorable tax rate adjustment due primarily to changes in export tax benefits and the global effective tax rate with respect to foreign operations. The company's ongoing net income was $455 million, or $0.27 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, up from $441 million, or $0.26 per share, for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and up from $95 million, or $0.06 per share, for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Ongoing results for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004 were the same as reported net income. New orders of $2.62 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 increased 7 percent from $2.46 billion for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and increased 105 percent from $1.28 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003. Regional distribution of new orders for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was: Taiwan 25 percent, Japan 20 percent, North America 17 percent, Korea 16 percent, Southeast Asia and China 11 percent, and Europe 11 percent. Backlog at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 was $3.37 billion, compared to $2.99 billion at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2004.

"We are pleased with our financial performance this quarter and our strong growth for this fiscal year," said Mike Splinter, president and chief executive officer. "Our team delivered solid results with increased orders driven by customer demand for our industry-leading 300mm and sub-100 nanometer products." -more-
Applied Materials, Inc. November 17, 2004 Page 2 of 7 The company also announced its results for its fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. Fiscal 2004 new orders were $8.98 billion, a 108 percent increase from fiscal 2003 new orders of $4.32 billion. Net sales for fiscal 2004 were $8.01 billion, a 79 percent increase from fiscal 2003 net sales of $4.48 billion. Net income for fiscal 2004 was $1.35 billion, or $0.78 per diluted share, up from a loss of $149 million, or $0.09 loss per share, for fiscal 2003. "We introduced 10 breakthrough products in critical technology areas for transistors, interconnects, defect review and flat panel displays, as well as new service products," Splinter continued. "Applied Materials increased its market share in a number of its core product areas and won customer awards for outstanding reliability and quality. "As the fourth quarter progressed, some customers became more cautious in response to inventory concerns, slowing their 200mm investments," said Splinter. "Even with these near-term market challenges, we believe our customers will continue to invest in advanced technology and 300mm manufacturing. We remain focused on translating our proven product and process expertise into cost-effective, innovative solutions for our customers," concluded Splinter.
