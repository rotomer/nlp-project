Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 5, 2006, Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") disclosed in this Form 8-K that its Board of Directors (the "Board") reappointed Charles Y.S. Liu as a member of the Board's Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") on May 2, 2006. Mr. Liu has been a member of the Board since September 14, 2005. Mr. Liu previously served as a member of the Audit Committee from December 14, 2005 to March 17, 2006.
Mr. Liu's reappointment to the Audit Committee follows Applied's receipt of a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") dated April 18, 2006, which stated that after reviewing additional information, Nasdaq had determined that the Board was not precluded by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15)(B)(i) from finding that Mr. Liu was an independent director. Nasdaq rescinded its earlier finding (stated in its March 17, 2006 letter to Applied) on Mr. Liu's eligibility to be an independent director, and ability to serve as a member of the Audit Committee under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2). Nasdaq's March 17, 2006 letter was disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Applied on March 20, 2006.
On May 2, 2006, following a recommendation by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, the Board determined that no relationship existed that would impair Mr. Liu's independence and that Mr. Liu met the criteria for independence required of all audit committee members under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4350(d)(2).
The information in this Form 8-K shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of Applied, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference in such filing. The information in this report shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
