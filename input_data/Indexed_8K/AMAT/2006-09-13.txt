Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 13, 2006, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") amended the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to change the grant date for annual stock option grants to non-employee directors. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, non-employee directors who serve on the Board for the entire fiscal year automatically receive an annual stock option grant under the Plan (the "Automatic Grant"). Prior to the amendment, the Automatic Grant was granted on the last business day of each of Applied's fiscal years. The Committee approved an amendment that changes the grant date of the Automatic Grant from the last business day of Applied's fiscal year to the first business day of Applied's subsequent fiscal year. The amendment will be effective immediately so that Automatic Grants for fiscal year 2006 will be granted on October 30, 2006 (the first business day of fiscal year 2007) rather than October 27, 2006 (the last business day of fiscal year 2006).
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
