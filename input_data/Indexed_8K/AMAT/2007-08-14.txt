Exhibit 99.1
Release: Immediate
     SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 14, 2007  Applied Materials, Inc. reported results for its third fiscal quarter ended July 29, 2007. Net sales were $2.56 billion, slightly up from $2.54 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and up from $2.53 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was 47.5 percent, down from 48.1 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and up from 44.9 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $474 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to net income of $512 million, or $0.33 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and compared to net income of $411 million, or $0.29 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
     Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $518 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $543 million, or $0.35 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $509 million, or $0.36 per share. Non-GAAP adjustments are explained below and further detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results.
     "Applied Materials delivered on our targets for revenue and profitability this quarter," said Mike Splinter, president and CEO. "The consolidation of our semiconductor equipment divisions into a single Silicon Systems Group will streamline the company to drive better results to the bottom line.
     "Memory demand drove opportunities for the semiconductor equipment industry and Applied. Conditions in the display industry remained challenging, as customers work to fully utilize existing capacity. We added three contracts for integrated thin film solar production lines to those announced this year, reflecting the expanding market for this technology."
     New orders of $2.28 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 decreased 14 percent from $2.67 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, and decreased 14 percent from $2.65 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Regional distribution of new orders for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was: Taiwan 31 percent, Japan 20 percent, Korea 19 percent, North America 12 percent, Europe 9 percent and Southeast Asia and China 9 percent. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $3.43 billion, compared to $3.67 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

     Results by reportable segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were:
     Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS, detailed in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results, exclude charges related to (i) equity-based compensation, (ii) asset impairment and restructuring activities, (iii) ceasing development of beamline implant products, (iv) certain items associated with acquisitions, including amortization of intangibles, inventory fair value adjustments on products sold and in-process research and development charges, and (v) the resolution of income tax audits and retroactive reinstatement of tax credits. Management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes that these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     Applied Materials will discuss its fiscal 2007 third quarter results, along with its outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. A webcast of the conference call will be available on Applied Materials' web site.
