These performance shares are scheduled to vest in four equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date, subject to Dr. de Geus's continued service as a director. Upon his appointment, Dr. de Geus began participating in the standard non-employee director compensation arrangements described in Applied's 2007 Proxy Statement that was filed with the SEC on February 14, 2007.
