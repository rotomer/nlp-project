Reduction in Base Salaries

This brings the total reduction to twenty percent (20%) below the annual base salary in effect for each NEO at this time last year. The adjusted annual base salaries for the NEOs as of February 9, 2009, are as follows:
 
NEOs to Forgo FY2009 Bonus
In support of Applied's cost-reduction activities, each of the NEOs will forgo his annual incentive bonus for fiscal 2009, even if the performance goals related to the bonus are fully achieved and a bonus would otherwise be payable, unless business conditions and financial results improve significantly.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
