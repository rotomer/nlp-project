On March 10, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Materials, Inc. ("Applied") approved a second ten percent (10%) reduction in the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors of the Board, in order to reduce costs in light of global economic and industry conditions. This reduction is in addition to the ten percent (10%) reduction in non-employee directors' annual cash retainer that previously was implemented in December 2008. This brings the non-employee directors' annual cash retainer to $52,000, which is a total reduction of twenty percent (20%) from $65,000, the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors of the Board in effect at the beginning of Applied's current fiscal year. This reduction in non-employee directors' compensation is consistent with the ongoing twenty percent (20%) reduction in base salary for each of Applied's senior executive officers.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
