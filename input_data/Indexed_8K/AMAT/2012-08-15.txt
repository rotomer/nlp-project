Exhibit 99.1
APPLIED MATERIALS DELIVERS SOLID THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 15, 2012  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), the global leader in manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, today reported results for its third quarter of fiscal 2012 ended July 29, 2012.
Applied generated orders of
$1.80 billion
and net sales of
$2.34 billion
. Non-GAAP operating income was
$431 million
, and non-GAAP net income was
$300 million
or
24 cents
per share. GAAP operating income was
$322 million
, and GAAP net income was
$218 million
or
17 cents
per share.
We delivered solid financial performance in line with our outlook despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, display and solar, said Mike Splinter, chairman and CEO.  Economic uncertainty is weighing on top of a seasonal pullback to produce weaker near-term demand.
Applied generated strong operating cash flow and ramped the return of cash to shareholders, buying back 3.6 percent of shares outstanding in the quarter, said George Davis, executive vice president and CFO. In a difficult environment, we are controlling spending while ensuring we prioritize investment in key areas to support future growth. 
Quarterly Results Summary
 
Third quarter results included $44 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, consisting primarily of costs associated with the EES restructuring plan announced on May 10, 2012. The plan also resulted in inventory-related charges of approximately $13 million that lowered gross margin by approximately half a percentage point and earnings per share by $0.01 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
During the quarter, Varian generated orders of $241 million and net sales of $294 million which were reported within the Silicon Systems Group (SSG) and Applied Global Services (AGS) segments. The business contributed approximately $0.04 to the company's non-GAAP EPS, which excluded acquisition-related charges equivalent to approximately $0.03 per share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP results to evaluate the companys operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. Applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the companys business from the same perspective as the companys management and facilitate comparisons of this periods results with prior periods. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
