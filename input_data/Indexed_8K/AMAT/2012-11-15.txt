APPLIED MATERIALS ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2012 RESULTS
Expects Orders to Increase in the First Quarter of FY2013
SANTA CLARA, Calif., November 15, 2012  Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), the global leader in manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 28, 2012.
In the fourth quarter, Applied generated orders of
$1.47 billion
and net sales of
$1.65 billion
. The company recorded a goodwill impairment and restructuring charges totaling $545 million and reported an operating loss of
$499 million
, with a net loss of
$515 million
or
42 cents
per diluted share. Non-GAAP operating income was
$114 million
, and non-GAAP net income was
$70 million
or
6 cents
per share, at the high end of the company's expectations.
In FY2012, the company reported orders of
$8.04 billion
, net sales of
$8.72 billion
, operating income of
$411 million
, and net income of
$109 million
or
9 cents
per diluted share. Non-GAAP operating income for the year was
$1.38 billion
, and non-GAAP net income was
$960 million
or
75 cents
per share.
In our fourth quarter, Applied delivered profit at the high end of our outlook despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, solar and display, said Mike Splinter, Chairman and CEO. Our strong cash flow performance allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend and share buybacks, returning
$1.85 billion
to stockholders in the year.
We see improving business conditions entering 2013, with orders projected to increase after bottoming in the fourth quarter," Splinter added. "Accelerated changes in device technology and the adoption of new materials in all of the industries we serve provide opportunities for Applied to build on our leadership and grow our market share.
Quarterly Results Summary
 
Fourth quarter results included a
$421 million
goodwill impairment charge associated with the Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) segment. The goodwill impairment reflects the deterioration in solar equipment market conditions, our customers' financial condition and reduced market valuations, causing Applied to reassess the recoverability of the segment's goodwill. Applied also reported $124 million in charges related to previously announced restructuring plans and the integration of Varian.
