Each such Authorization is valid and in full force and effect and each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in compliance with all the terms and conditions thereof and with the rules and regulations of the authorities and governing bodies having jurisdiction with respect thereto; and no event has occurred (including, without limitation, the receipt of any notice from any authority or governing body) which allows or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would allow, revocation, suspension or termination of any such Authorization or results or, after notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any other impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Authorization; and such Authorizations contain no restrictions that are burdensome to the Company or any of its subsidiaries; except where such failure to be valid and in full force and effect or to be in compliance, the occurrence of any such event or the presence of any such restriction would not, singly or in 9

Except as set forth in the Prospectus, (i) there is no material infringement by third parties of any such Intellectual Property; (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging the rights of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in or to any such Intellectual Property; (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others challenging the validity or scope of any such Intellectual Property; (iv) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no pending or threatened action, suit, proceeding or claim by others that the Company infringes or otherwise violates any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary rights of others; (v) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no U.S. patent or published U.S. patent application which contains claims that dominate or may dominate any Intellectual Property described in the Prospectus as being owned by or licensed to the Company or any of its 10
subsidiaries or that interferes with the issued or pending claims or any such Intellectual Property; and (vi) there is no prior art of which the Company is aware that may render any U.S. patent held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries invalid or any U.S. patent application held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries unpatentable which has not been disclosed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, except for the foregoing items set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) of this subparagraph, which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business. Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter. 2. Purchase and Sale. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of 97.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, on the Securities from November 25, 2002, to the Closing Date, the principal amount of the Firm Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters, severally and not jointly, to purchase Option Securities in aggregate principal amount of up to $52,500,000 at the same price per Security (plus interest, if any, accrued and unpaid from November 25, 2002 until the applicable Date of Delivery (as defined herein)), as is applicable to the Firm Securities. Such option will expire 30 days after the date of this Agreement, and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time (but not more than once) only for the purpose of covering over-allotments that may be made in connection with the offering and distribution of the Firm Securities, upon notice by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the principal amount of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities. Any such time and date of delivery (a "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than seven full business days and not earlier than two full business days after the exercise of said option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Date, as hereinafter defined, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Representatives 11
and the Company. The principal amount of the Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total principal amount of the Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Firm Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives in their absolute discretion shall make to eliminate any Securities in a principal amount of less than $1,000. 3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Firm Securities and the Option Securities (if the option provided for in Section 2(b) hereof shall have been exercised on or before the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date) shall be made at 10:00 AM, New York City time, on November 25, 2002, or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to the account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct. If the option provided for in Section 2(b) hereof is exercised after the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company will deliver the Option Securities (at the expense of the Company) to the Representatives on the date specified by the Representatives (which shall be within three Business Days after exercise of said option) for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters, against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same day funds to the account specified by the Company. If settlement for the Option Securities occurs after the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to the Representatives on the settlement date, and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Option Securities shall be conditioned upon receipt of, supplemental opinions, certificates and letters confirming as of such date the opinions, certificates and letters delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 6 hereof 4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Prospectus. 5. Agreements. The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that: 12
(a) The Company will use its reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereof, to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (e) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to taxation in excess of a normal dollar amount or service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

(j) The Company will not for a period of 60 days following the Execution Time, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, or file (or participate in the filing of) a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction mentioned above, with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Company or any securities convertible or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock; provided, however, that (A) the Company may issue and sell Common Stock pursuant to any employee stock option plan, stock ownership or purchase plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company in effect at the Execution Time, (B) the Company may issue Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of securities or the exercise of warrants outstanding at the Execution Time, and (C) the Company may issue Common Stock upon conversion of the Securities. (k) The Company will not, for so long as any Securities are outstanding, be or become, or be or become owned by, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or face-amount certificate company that is or is required to be registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act, and will not be or become, or be or become owned by, a closed-end investment company required to be registered but not registered thereunder. (l) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company will not do or authorize any act or thing that would result in an adjustment of the conversion price of the Securities.

Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date and any applicable Date of Delivery pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: (a) If the Registration Statement has not become effective prior to the Execution Time, unless the Representatives agree in writing to a later time, the Registration Statement will become effective not later than (i) 6:00 PM New York City time, on the date of determination of the public offering price, if such determination occurred at or prior to 3:00 PM New York City time on such date or (ii) 9:30 AM on the Business Day following the day on which the public offering price was determined, if such determination occurred after 3:00 PM New York City time on such date; if filing of the Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is required pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Prospectus, and any such supplement, will be filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened.

(e) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date; 21
(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth or incorporated by reference in or contemplated in the Prospectus. (f) At the date of this Agreement, the Representatives shall have received an executed lockup agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 from each of the persons listed on Schedule II and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-2 from each of the persons listed on Schedule III hereto.

and the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time). (i) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Salomon Smith Barney Inc. for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the 23
meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting," (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus. 24
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters 25
severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 26
9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company or any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities, (iii) there shall have occurred any major disruption of settlements of securities, (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in United States or international, political, financial or economic conditions the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto after the Execution Time). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation 27

All Securities of any series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. The principal of and any interest on the Securities shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company designated in the form of Security for the series (each such place herein called the "Place of Payment"); provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the register of Securities referred to in Section 2.03 hereof. Each Security shall be in one of the forms approved from time to time by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. Prior to the delivery of a Security to the Trustee for authentication in any form approved by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee the Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate by or pursuant to which such 6
form of Security has been approved, which Board Resolution or Officers' Certificate shall have attached thereto a true and correct copy of the form of Security which has been approved by or pursuant thereto. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. Section 2.02 Execution and Authentication. Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature. The Company's seal shall be reproduced on the Securities manually or by facsimile. If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall nevertheless be valid. A Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication. The Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and make available for delivery said Securities to or upon the Written Request of the Company. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and, subject to Section 1.01, shall be fully protected in relying upon: (a) A copy of the resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors in or pursuant to which the terms and form of the Securities were established, certified by the Secretary of an Assistant Secretary of the Company to have been duly adopted by the Board of Directors and to be in full force and effect as of the date of such certificate, or if the terms and form of such Securities are established by an Officers' Certificate pursuant to general authorization of the Board of Directors, such Officers' Certificate; (b) an executed supplement indenture, if any; and (c) an Officers' Certificate delivered in accordance with Sections 10.04 and 10.05. The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders. The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes 7
authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company. Section 2.03 Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities of a particular series may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented for payment (a "Paying Agent"). The Registrar for a particular series of Securities shall keep a register of the Securities of that series and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-Registrars and one or more additional paying agents for each series of Securities. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar without prior notice to any Securityholder. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent for any series of Securities, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of its Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or co-Registrar. The Company hereby appoints the Trustee the initial Registrar and Paying Agent for each series of Securities unless another Registrar or Paying Agent, as the case may be, is appointed prior to the time Securities of that series are first issued. Section 2.04 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust. Whenever the Company has one or more Paying Agents it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on, any Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that such Paying Agent will hold in trust for the benefit of the Securityholders of the particular series for which it is acting, or the Trustee, all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal or interest on the Securities of such series, and that such Paying Agent will notify the Trustee of any Default by the Company or any other obligor of the series of Securities in making any such payment and at any time during the continuance of any such Default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent. If the Company or an Affiliate acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Securityholders of the particular series for which it is acting all money held by it as Paying Agent. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon so doing, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company) shall have no further liability for such money. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to the Company, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for the Securities. 8
Section 2.05 Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders, separately by series, and shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least seven business days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders, separately by series, relating to such interest payment date or request, as the case may be. Section 2.06 Transfer and Exchange. Where Securities of a series are presented to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with a request to register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same series of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if its requirements for such transactions are met. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06 or 9.04). The Company need not issue, and the Registrar or co-Registrar need not register the transfer or exchange of, (i) any Security of a particular series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series under Section 3.02 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security of that series being redeemed in part. Section 2.07 Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security of same series if the Company's and the Trustee's requirements are met. The Trustee or the Company shall require an indemnity bond to be furnished which is sufficient in the judgment of both to protect the Company, the Trustee, and any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for its expenses in replacing a Security. Every replacement Security is an obligation of the Company and shall be entitled to all the benefit of the Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series. 9
Section 2.08 Outstanding Securities. The Securities of any series outstanding at any time are all the Securities of that series authenticated by the Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation, and those described in this Section as not outstanding. If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser. If Securities are considered paid under Section 4.01, they cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue. Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate holds the Security. For each series of Original Issue Discount Securities, the principal amount of such Securities that shall be deemed to be outstanding and used to determine whether the necessary Holders have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver shall be the principal amount of such Securities that could be declared to be due and payable upon acceleration upon an Event of Default as of the date of such determination. When requested by the Trustee, the Company will advise the Trustee of such amount, showing its computations in reasonable detail. Section 2.09 Treasury Securities. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities of any series have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or an Affiliate shall be considered as though they are not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which a Trust Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so considered. Section 2.10 Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities upon a Company Request signed by one Officer of the Company. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities in exchange for temporary Securities. Holders of temporary securities shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture. 10
Section 2.11 Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest. If the Company fails to make a payment of interest on any series of Securities, it shall pay such defaulted interest plus (to the extent lawful) any interest payable on the defaulted interest, in any lawful manner. It may elect to pay such defaulted interest, plus any such interest payable on it, to the Persons who are Holders of such Securities on which the interest is due on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each such Security. The Company shall fix any such record date and payment date for such payment. At least 15 days before any such record date, the Company shall mail to Securityholders affected thereby a notice that states the record date, payment date, and amount of such interest to be paid. Section 2.13 Special Record Dates. (a) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, set a record date for the purpose of determining the identity of Holders entitled to consent to any supplement, amendment or waiver permitted by this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, the Holders of Securities of that series outstanding on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to consent to such supplement, amendment or waiver or revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date unless consents from Holders of the principal amount of Securities of that series required hereunder for such amendment or waiver to be effective shall have also been given and not revoked within such 90-day period. (b) The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, fix any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of any series of Securities entitled to join in the giving or making of any notice of Default, any declaration of acceleration, any request to institute proceedings or any other similar direction. If a record date is fixed, the Holders of Securities of that series outstanding on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the date 90 days after such record date. Section 2.14 CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a 11
convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers. ARTICLE 3 REDEMPTION Section 3.01 Notices to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem Securities of any series pursuant to any optional redemption provisions thereof, it shall notify the Trustee of the redemption date and the principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed. The Company shall give the notice provided for in this Section at least 45 days before the redemption date (unless a shorter notice period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), which notice shall specify the provisions of such Security pursuant to which the Company elects to redeem such Securities. If the Company elects to reduce the principal amount of Securities of any series to be redeemed pursuant to mandatory redemption provisions thereof, it shall notify the Trustee of the amount of, and the basis for, any such reduction. If the Company elects to credit against any such mandatory redemption Securities it has not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, it shall deliver such Securities with such notice. Section 3.02 Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities of that series to be redeemed by a method that complies with the requirements of any exchange on which the Securities of that series are listed, or, if the Securities of that series are not listed on an exchange, on a pro rata basis or by lot. The Trustee shall make the selection not more than 75 days and not less than 30 days before the redemption date from Securities of that series outstanding and not previously called for redemption. Except as otherwise provided as to any particular series of Securities, Securities and portions thereof that the Trustee selects shall be in amounts equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of the series to be redeemed or any integral multiple thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly in writing of the Securities or portions of Securities to be called for redemption. Section 3.03 Notice of Redemption. Except as otherwise provided as to any particular series of Securities, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Securities are to be redeemed. 12
The notice shall identify the Securities of the series to be redeemed and shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the redemption price fixed in accordance with the terms of the Securities of the series to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (the "redemption price"); (3) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued; (4) the name and address of the Paying Agent; (5) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; (6) that, unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date; and (7) the CUSIP number, if any, of the Securities to be redeemed. At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at its expense. The notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice of the Holder of any Security shall not affect the validity of the proceeding for the redemption of any other Security. Section 3.04 Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, Securities called for redemption become due and payable on the redemption date for the redemption price. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities will be paid at the Redemption Price. Section 3.05 Deposit of Redemption Price. On or before 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or any Affiliate is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all Securities called for redemption on that date other than Securities which have previously been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. The Paying Agent shall return to the Company any money not required for that purpose. 13
Section 3.06 Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Company a new Security of same series equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered. ARTICLE 4 COVENANTS Section 4.01 Payment of Securities. The Company shall pay or cause to be paid the principal of and interest on the Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in this Indenture and the Securities. Principal and interest shall be considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent, if other than the Company or an Affiliate, holds as of 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on that date immediately available funds designated for and sufficient to pay all principal and interest then due. To the extent lawful, the Company shall pay interest on overdue principal and overdue installments of interest at the rate per annum borne by the applicable series of Securities. Section 4.02 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company shall maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, an office or agency (which may be an office of the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee or Registrar) where Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the corporate trust office of the Trustee. The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York for such purposes. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency. The Company hereby designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee as one such office or agency of the Company in accordance with Section 2.03. Section 4.03 Commission Reports. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the Commission copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may by rules and 14
regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however the Company shall not be required to deliver to the Trustee any materials for which the Company has sought and received confidential treatment by the Commission. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of TIA Section 314(a). Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates). Section 4.04 Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, an Officers' Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as officers of the Company, they would normally have knowledge of any failure by the Company to comply with all conditions, or default by the Company with respect to any covenants, under this Indenture, and further stating whether or not they have knowledge of any such failure or default and, if so, specifying each such failure or default and the nature thereof. For purposes of this Section, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided for in this Indenture. The certificate need not comply with Section 10.04. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, as soon as possible and in any event within five days after the Company becomes aware of the occurrence of any Event of Default or an event which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate setting forth the details of such Event of Default or default and the action which the Company proposes to take with respect thereto. Section 4.05 Taxes. The Company shall pay prior to delinquency, all material taxes, assessments, and governmental levies except as contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. Section 4.06 Stay, Extension and Usury Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted. 15
Section 4.07 Corporate Existence. Subject to Article 5 hereof, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect (i) its corporate existence, and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of each Subsidiary and (ii) the rights (charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its Subsidiaries, if the Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders. Section 4.08 Calculation of Original Issue Discount. The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. ARTICLE 5 SUCCESSORS Section 5.01 When Company May Merge, etc. The Company shall not consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to any Person unless: (1) the Company is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (2) the Person formed by or assuming any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made assumes by supplemental indenture all the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture; and (3) immediately prior to and after giving effect to the transaction no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 16
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee on or prior to the consummation of the proposed transaction an Officers' Certificate to the foregoing effect and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the proposed transaction and such supplemental indenture comply with this Indenture. Section 5.02 Successor Corporation Substituted. Upon any consolidation or merger, or any transfer by the Company (other than by lease) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 5.01, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to which such transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor corporation had been named as the Company herein. In the event of any such transfer, the predecessor Company shall be released and discharged from all liabilities and obligations in respect of the Securities and the Indenture, and the predecessor Company may be dissolved, wound up or liquidated at any time thereafter. ARTICLE 6 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES Section 6.01 Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs with respect to Securities of any particular series if, unless in the establishing Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture hereto, it is provided that such series shall not have the benefit of said Event of Default: (1) the Company defaults in the payment of interest on any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable and the Default continues for a period of 30 days; (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of any Security of that series when the same becomes due and payable at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (3) an Event of Default, as defined in the Securities of that series, occurs and is continuing, or the Company fails to comply with any of its other agreements in the Securities of that series or in this Indenture with respect to that series and the Default continues for the period and after the notice specified below; (4) the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law: (A) commences a voluntary case; (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case; 17
(C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property; (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or (E) admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as the same become due. (5) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that: (A) is for relief against the Company in an involuntary case; (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or for all or substantially all of its property; or (C) orders the liquidation of the Company; and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 days. (6) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series which is specified in a Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture establishing that series of Securities. The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, U.S. Code or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law. A Default under clause (3) above is not an Event of Default with respect to a particular series of Securities until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 50% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series notify the Company of the Default and the Company does not cure the Default within 30 days after receipt of the notice. The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that the notice is a "Notice of Default." Section 6.02 Acceleration. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series (other than an Event of Default specified in clauses (4) and (5) of Section 6.01) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 50% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the unpaid principal (or, in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, such lesser amount as may be provided for in such Securities) of and any accrued interest on all the Securities of that series to be due and payable on the Securities of that series. Upon such declaration the principal (or such lesser amount) and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (4) or (5) of Section 6.01 occurs, all of such amount shall become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of 18
that series by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default with respect to that series have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal (or such lesser amount) or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration. Section 6.03 Other Remedies. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities of that series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of that series or this Indenture. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. Section 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults. Subject to Section 9.02, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series by notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of Default with respect to that series and its consequences except a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal (including any mandatory sinking fund or like payment) of or interest on any Security of that series (provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration). Section 6.05 Control by Majority. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy with respect to that series available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that is unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder of Securities of that series, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Trustee may take any other action which it deems proper which is not inconsistent with any such direction. Section 6.06 Limitation on Suits. A Holder of Securities of any series may not pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless: (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to that series; 19
(2) the Holders of at least 50% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of indemnity; and (5) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request. No Holder of any series of Securities may use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of Securities of that series or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of Securities of that series. Section 6.07 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Security to receive payment of principal of and interest, if any, on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder. Section 6.08 Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal (or such portion of the principal as may be specified as due upon acceleration at that time in the terms of that series of Securities) and interest, if any, remaining unpaid on the Securities of that series then outstanding, together with (to the extent lawful) interest on overdue principal and interest, and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and, to the extent lawful, expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. Section 6.09 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor on the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled to and empowered to collect and receive any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same, and any custodian in any such judicial proceedings is hereby authorized by each 20
Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding. Section 6.10 Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money with respect to Securities of any series pursuant to this Article, it shall pay out the money in the following order: First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.07, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection; Second: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities of such series for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities of such series for principal and interest, respectively; and Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct. The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Securities of any series pursuant to this Section. The Trustee shall notify the Company in writing reasonably in advance of any such record date and payment date. Section 6.11 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defense made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities. 21
ARTICLE 7 TRUSTEE Section 7.01 Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs. (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default known to the Trustee: (i) the duties of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture or the TIA and the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture or the TIA and no others, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein). (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that: (i) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section; (ii) Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer of the Trustee, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and 22
(iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof. (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this Section. (e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur any liability. The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. (f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Company. Absent written instruction from the Company, the Trustee shall not be required to invest any such money. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. Section 7.02 Rights of Trustee. Subject to TIA Section 315(a) through (d): (a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

(d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers, unless the Trustee's conduct constitutes negligence. (e) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Company. (f) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon. 23
(g) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. (h) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee its principle corporate trust office, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture. (i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder. Section 7.03 Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company or an Affiliate with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee is subject to TIA Sections 310(b) and 311. Section 7.04 Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Securities other than its certificate of authentication. Section 7.05 Notice of Defaults. If a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series occurs and is continuing and if it is actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to all Holders of Securities of that series a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment on any such Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of such Securityholders. Section 7.06 Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after May 1 in each year, the Trustee with respect to any series of Securities shall mail to Holders of Securities of that series as provided in TIA Section 313(c) a brief report dated as of such May 1 that complies with TIA Section 313(a) (if such report is required by TIA Section 313(a)). The Trustee shall also comply with TIA Section 313(b). 24
A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the Commission and each stock exchange on which any of the Securities are listed, as required by TIA Section 313(d). The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Securities are listed on any stock exchange or of any delisting thereof. Section 7.07 Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation as shall be agreed upon in writing for its services hereunder. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon written request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and out-of-pocket expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel. The Company shall indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee for any and all loss, damage, claim, expense or liability incurred by it, without negligence or bad faith on its part, in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture and its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent. To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee in its capacity as Trustee, except money or property held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Securities. Such lien will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. If the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(4) or (5) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services will be intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Bankruptcy Law. Section 7.08 Replacement of Trustee. A resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to one or more or all series of Securities and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section. The Trustee may resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by so notifying the Company in writing. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series may remove the Trustee as to that series by so notifying the Trustee in writing and may appoint a successor Trustee with the Company's consent. The Company may remove the Trustee with respect to one or more or all series of Securities if: (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10; (2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent; 25
(3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or (4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting. If, as to any series of Securities, the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee for that series. Within one year after the successor Trustee with respect to any series takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If a successor Trustee as to a particular series does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 with respect to any series, any Holder of Securities of that series who satisfies the requirements of TIA Section 310(b) may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee for that series. A successor Trustee as to any series of Securities shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that, the retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee (subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07), the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture as to that series. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to the Holders of Securities of that series. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring trustee. In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary or desirable to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee; provided, however, that nothing herein or in such supplemental Indenture shall constitute such Trustee co-trustees of the same trust and that each 26
such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust hereunder separate and apart from any trust hereunder administered by any other such Trustee. Upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental Indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. Section 7.09 Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee as to any series of Securities consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee as to that series. Section 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualification. Each series of Securities shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements of TIA Section 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee as to any series of Securities shall always have a combined capital and surplus of at least $25,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 310(b). Section 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. ARTICLE 8 SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE DEFEASANCE Section 8.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Order cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when (a) either (i) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than Securities that have been destroyed, lost stolen and that have been replaced or paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (ii) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation 27
(2) have become due and payable, or (3) will become due and payable at their stated maturity within one year, or (4) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, or (5) are deemed paid and discharged pursuant to Section 8.03, as applicable; and the Company, in the case of (1), (2) or (3) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust an amount sufficient for the purpose of paying and discharging the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable on or prior to the date of such deposit) or to the stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (b) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.07, and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to clause (a) of this Section or if money or obligations shall have been deposited with or received by the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.03, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 8.02 and Section 8.05 shall survive. Section 8.02 Application of Trust Funds; Indemnification. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 8.05, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.01, all money and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.03 or 8.04 and all money received by the Trustee in respect of U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.03 or 8.04, shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the persons entitled thereto, of the principal and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee or to make mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments as contemplated by Sections 8.03 and 8.04. 28
(b) The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Sections 8.03 or 8.04 or the interest and principal received in respect of such obligations other than any payable by or on behalf of Holders. (c) The Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any U.S. Government Obligations or money held by it as provided in Sections 8.03 or 8.04 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are then in excess of the amount thereof which then would have been required to be deposited for the purpose for which such U.S. Government Obligations or money were deposited or received. This provision shall not authorize the sale by the Trustee of any U.S. Government Obligations held under this Indenture. Section 8.03 Legal Defeasance of Securities of any Series. Unless this Section 8.03 is otherwise specified to be inapplicable to Securities of any series, the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the outstanding Securities of any such series on the 91st day after the date of the deposit referred to in subparagraph (d) hereof, and the provisions of this Indenture, as it relates to such outstanding Securities of such series, shall no longer be in effect (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall, upon Company Request, execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except as to: (a) the rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, from the trust funds described in subparagraph (d) hereof, (i) payment of the principal of an each installment of principal of or interest on the outstanding Securities of such series on the stated maturity of such principal of or interest and (ii) the benefit of any mandatory sinking fund payments applicable to the Securities of such series on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Securities of such series; (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities of such series under Sections 2.03, 2.06 and 2.07; and (c) the rights, powers, trust and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the duties of the Trustee under Section 8.02 and the duty of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued on registration of transfer of exchange; provided that, the following conditions shall have been satisfied: (d) the Company shall have deposited or caused to be deposited irrevocably with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, cash in U.S. Dollars and/or U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof, in accordance with their terms, will provide (and without reinvestment and assuming no tax liability will be imposed on such Trustee), not later than one day before the due date of 29
any payment of money, an amount in cash, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge each installment of principal (including mandatory sinking fund or analogous payments) of and interest, if any, on all the Securities of such series on the dates such installments of interest or principal are due; (e) such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; (f) no Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 91st day after such date; (g) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred; (h) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Securities of such series over any other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors of the Company; (i) such deposit shall not result in the trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended), or such trust shall be qualified under such Act or exempt from regulation thereunder; and (j) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the defeasance contemplated by this Section have been complied with. Section 8.04 Covenant Defeasance. Unless this Section 8.04 is otherwise inapplicable to Securities of any series, on and after the 91st day after the date of the deposit referred to in subparagraph (a) hereof, the Company may omit to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth under Sections 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07 and 5.01 as well as any additional covenants contained in a supplemental indenture hereto for a particular series of Securities or a Board Resolution or an Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(n) (and the failure to comply with any 30
such provisions shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default under Section 6.01) and the occurrence of any event described in clause (e) of Section 6.01 shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that the following conditions shall have been satisfied: (a) With reference to this Section 8.04, the Company has deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited (except as provided in Section 8.03) with the Trustee as trust funds in trust, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, cash in U.S. Dollars and/or U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof, in accordance with their terms, will provide (and without reinvestment and assuming no tax liability will be imposed on such Trustee), not later than one day before the due date of any payment of money, an amount in cash, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay principal and interest, if any, on and any mandatory sinking fund in respect of the Securities of such series on the dates such installments of interest or principal are due; (b) Such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; (c) No Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period ending on the 91st day after such date; (d) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that Holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; (e) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Securities of such series over any other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors of the Company; and (f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the defeasance contemplated by this Section have been complied with.

ARTICLE 9 SUPPLEMENTS, AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS Section 9.01 Without Consent of Holders. The Company and the Trustee as to any series of Securities may supplement or amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or the consent of any Securityholder: (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency; (2) to comply with Article 5; (3) to comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; (4) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; (5) to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture in respect of one or more series of Securities, provided, however, that any such addition, change or elimination (A) shall neither (i) apply to any Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (ii) modify the rights of the Holder of any such Security with respect to such provision or (B) shall become effective only when there is no outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision; (6) to make any change that does not adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the Securityholders of any series; or (7) to establish additional series of Securities as permitted by Section 2.01. Section 9.02 With Consent of Holders. Subject to Section 6.07, the Company and the Trustee as to any series of Securities may amend this Indenture or the Securities of that series with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of each series affected by the amendment, with each such series voting as a separate class. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Securities of any series may also waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture with respect to that series or the Securities of that series; provided, however, that without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment or waiver may not: 32
(1) reduce the percentage of the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment or waiver; (2) reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the payment of any sinking fund or analogous provision; (3) reduce the rate of, or change the time for payment of interest on, any Security; (4) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Security or waive a redemption payment or alter the redemption provisions with respect thereto; (5) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security; (6) reduce the principal amount of Original Issue Discount Securities payable upon acceleration of the maturity thereof; (7) make any change in Section 6.04, 6.07 or 9.02 (this sentence); or (8) waive a default in the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any Security, except to the extent otherwise provided for in Section 6.02. An amendment or waiver under this Section which waives, changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series. It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. The Company will mail supplemental indentures to Holders upon request. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture or waiver. Section 9.03 Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security; provided, however, that unless a record date shall have been established pursuant to Section 2.13(a), any such Holder or subsequent Holder 33
may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date on which the amendment or waiver becomes effective. An amendment or waiver shall become effective on receipt by the Trustee of consents from the Holders of the requisite percentage principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series, and thereafter shall bind every Holder of Securities of that series. Section 9.04 Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment or waiver changes the terms of a Security: (a) the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee, the Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to the Holder and the Trustee may place an appropriate notation on any Security thereafter authenticated; or (b) if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Section 9.05 Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The Trustee shall receive an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of any amendment or waiver proposed pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted by this Indenture. Subject to the preceding sentence, the Trustee shall sign such amendment or waiver if the same does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture (other than the certificate provided for in Section 4.03) shall include: (1) a statement that the Person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition; (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based; (3) a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such Person, such condition or covenant has been complied with; provided, however, that with respect to matters of fact an Opinion of Counsel may rely on an Officers' Certificate or certificates of public officials. Section 10.06 Rules by Trustee and Agents. The Trustee as to Securities of any series may make reasonable rules for action by or at a meeting of Holders of Securities of that series. The Registrar and any Paying Agent or Authenticating Agent may make reasonable rules and set reasonable requirements for their functions. Section 10.07 Legal Holidays. A "Legal Holiday" is a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in New York, New York, are not required to be open. If a payment date is a Legal Holiday at a place of payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

A past, present or future director, officer, employee, stockholder or incorporator, as such, of the Company or any successor corporation shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under any series of Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration of issuance of the Securities. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy. 36

June 1, to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered at the close of business on the May 15 and November 15, respectively, immediately preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, whether or not a Business Day (each, a "Regular Record Date"); such interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.

The following provisions apply to the payment of interest on the Notes. Section 2.12 of the Base Indenture shall be replaced by subparagraph 2.02 herein and references to Section 2.12 of the Base Indenture shall be read to refer to subparagraph 2.02 herein: 2.01. Interest Payment. Interest on any Note that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Note is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose. Each installment of interest on any Note shall be made by check mailed to the address of the Holder specified in the register of Securities, or, at the option of the Holder, at the Corporate Trust Office, in such lawful money of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that, with respect to any Holder of Securities with an aggregate principal amount in excess of $5,000,000, at the request of such Holder in writing to the Company, interest on such Holder's Notes shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds in accordance with the written wire transfer instruction supplied by such Holder from time to time to the Trustee and Paying Agent (if different from the Trustee) at least two days prior to the applicable Regular Record Date. In the case of a Global Security, interest payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the Depositary by wire transfer or immediately available funds, with respect to that portion of such permanent Global Security held for its account by Cede & Co. for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof. 2.02. Defaulted Interest. Except as otherwise specified with respect to the Notes, any interest on any Note that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, within 30 days following any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest", which term shall include any accrued and unpaid interest that has accrued on such defaulted amount), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular 2
Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, as its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on a date (the "Special Record Date") for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in this clause. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Notes at such Holder's address as it appears on the list of Securityholders maintained pursuant to Section 2.05 of the Base Indenture not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Notes in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions, each Note delivered under the Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Note. 3. Global Securities. 3
3.01. General. Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under the Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under the Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of the Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Indenture shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of any Holder. The Holder of the Global Securities may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under the Indenture or the Notes. 3.02. Transfers of Global Securities. Transfers of the Global Securities shall be limited to transfers in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary, its successors or their respective nominees. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, for Physical Securities in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary. In addition, Physical Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners in exchange for their beneficial interests in the Global Securities if (i) such Depositary has notified the Company (or the Company becomes aware) that the Depositary (A) is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or (B) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and, in both such cases, no successor Depositary shall have been appointed within 90 days of such notification or of the Company becoming aware of such event or (ii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security and the Outstanding Notes shall have become due and payable pursuant to subparagraph 4.02 hereof and the Trustee requests that Physical Securities be issued. In connection with any transfer or exchange of a portion of the beneficial interest in the Global Security to beneficial owners, the Registrar shall (if one or more Physical Securities are to be issued) reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Security in an amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, one or more Physical Securities of like tenor and amount. In connection with the transfer of the entire Global Security to beneficial owners, the Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in the Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Physical Securities of authorized denominations and the same tenor. 4. Events of Default and Related Provisions. Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.04, 6.06 and 7.05 of the Base Indenture shall not be applicable to the Notes. Instead, the following provisions will 4
apply and references to Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.04, 6.06 and 7.05 in the Base Indenture shall be read to refer respectively to subparagraphs 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04 and 4.05 herein: 4.01. Events of Default. "Event of Default", wherever used herein, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of the Principal, premium, if any, Redemption Price or Repurchase Price on any Note when it becomes due and payable; or (2) default in the payment of interest upon any Note, when such interest becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (3) default in the performance of any covenant, agreement or condition of the Company in the Indenture or in the Notes (other than a default specified in clause (1) or (2) above), and continuance of such default for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes a written notice specifying such default and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (4) failure by the Company to give the Company Notice; or (5) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company under any applicable federal or state law or (iii) appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; (6) the commencement by the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, 5
insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable federal or state law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; (7) the failure by the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries to make any payment at maturity, including any applicable grace period, with respect to any indebtedness of, or guaranteed or assumed by, the Company or its significant subsidiaries, in a principal amount then outstanding in excess of $25 million in the aggregate for all such indebtedness and the continuance of such failure for a period of 30 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, a written notice specifying such default and requiring the Company to cause such default to be cured or waived and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or (8) the default on the part of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries with respect to any indebtedness of, or guaranteed or assumed by, the Company or its significant subsidiaries, in a principal amount then outstanding in excess of $25 million in the aggregate for all such indebtedness, and such indebtedness shall not have been discharged or such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled for a period of 30 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, a written notice specifying such default and requiring the Company to cause such default to be cured or waived or such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder. "significant subsidiary", as used herein, has the meaning given to that term in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act, except that references to income from continuing operations are changed to revenues. 4.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than those specified in clauses (5) and (6) of subparagraph 4.01 above) occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare the Principal plus accrued and unpaid interest on all the Outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such Principal plus accrued and unpaid interest shall become immediately due and payable. 6
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default specified in clauses (5) or (6) of subparagraph 4.01 above, the Principal plus accrued and unpaid interest on all Outstanding Notes will ipso facto become due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Paragraph provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (i) all overdue interest on all Notes, (ii) the Principal plus accrued and unpaid interest, Redemption Price or Repurchase Price, as applicable, on any Notes which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, (iii) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 of the Base Indenture; and (iv) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the Principal plus accrued and unpaid interest on Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in subparagraph 4.03 hereof. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. 4.03. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any past Default hereunder and its consequences, except a Default: (ii) described in clause (1) or (2) of subparagraph 4.01 above; or (iii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article 9 of the Base Indenture and subparagraph 5.02 hereof cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Note affected. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 4.04. Limitation on Suits. No Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder (other than in the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (1) or (2) of subparagraph 4.01 above), unless: (a) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default; (b) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; 7
(c) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (d) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (e) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of the Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under the Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders. 4.05. Notice of Defaults. The Trustee shall give the Holders notice of any Default hereunder within 60 days after the occurrence thereof, unless such Default has been cured or waived in such 60 day period; provided, that in the case of any Default in the payment of Principal or interest on any of the Notes, Redemption Price or Repurchase Price, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or a Trust Officer of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Notes. 5. Supplemental Indentures with and without Consent of Holders. 5.01 Supplemental Indentures without Consent of the Holders. In addition to the purposes for which a supplemental indenture may be entered into without the consent of the Holders of the Notes set forth in Section 9.01 of the Base Indenture, the following shall be considered such a purpose: (i) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Holders of Notes; (ii) to make any provisions to secure the Notes; and (iii) to provide for the acceptance and appointment of a successor trustee. 5.02 Supplemental Indentures with Consent of the Holders. In addition to the limitations on supplemental indentures with the consent of Holders set forth in Section 9.02 of the Base Indenture, the following limitations shall apply with respect to the Notes and shall be subject to the other provisions of Article 9 of the Base Indenture: (i) change the Regular Record Dates; 8
(ii) reduce the Redemption Price, the Repurchase Price or make any change that adversely affects the rights of the holders of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase the Notes upon a Fundamental Change; (iii) make any change that adversely affects the right of a Holder to convert any Note as provided in Paragraph 9 hereof. 6. Optional Redemption of Notes by the Company. The following provisions apply to the optional redemption of Notes by the Company, in place of the provisions in Article 3 of the Base Indenture and references to Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05 and 3.06 shall be read to refer respectively to subparagraph 6.01, 6.02, 6.03, 6.04, 6.05 and 6.06 herein: 6.01. Right to Redeem; Notices to Trustee. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. If the Company elects to redeem Notes, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the Redemption Date, the Principal of Notes to be redeemed and the Redemption Price. The Company shall give the notice to the Trustee provided for in this Section 6.01 by a Company Order, at least 45 days before the Redemption Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee). 6.02. Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed. If less than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Notes to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method the Trustee considers fair and appropriate (so long as such method is not prohibited by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are then listed). The Trustee shall make the selection within 7 days from its receipt of the notice from the Company delivered pursuant to subparagraph 6.01 from Outstanding Notes not previously called for redemption. Notes and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000. Provisions of the Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Notes or portions of Notes to be redeemed. If any Notes selected for partial redemption are converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the Notes so selected, the converted portion of such Notes shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption. Notes which have been converted during a selection of Notes to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as outstanding for the purpose of such selection. 6.03. Notice of Redemption. At least 15 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed. The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price; 9
(iii) the Conversion Price; (iv) the name and address of the Paying Agent and Conversion Agent; (v) that Notes called for redemption may be converted at any time before the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date; (vi) that Holders who want to convert Notes must satisfy the requirements set forth therein and in the Indenture; (vii) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent for cancellation to collect the Redemption Price; (viii) if fewer than all the outstanding Notes are to be redeemed, the certificate number and principal amounts of the particular Notes to be redeemed; (ix) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Redemption Price, interest on Notes called for redemption will cease to accrue on and after the Redemption Date; and (x) the CUSIP number of the Notes. At the Company's written request delivered at least 15 days prior to the date such notice is to be given (unless a shorter time period shall be acceptable to the Trustee), the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense. 6.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is given, Notes called for redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption Price stated in the notice except for Notes which are converted in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Notes shall be paid at the Redemption Price stated in the notice. 6.05. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City Time) on a Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Notes to be redeemed on that date other than Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption which on or prior thereto have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation or have been converted. The Paying Agent shall as promptly as practicable return to the Company any money not required for that purpose because of conversion of Notes pursuant to Paragraph 9. If such money is then held by the Company in trust and is not required for such purpose it shall be discharged from such trust. 6.06. Notes Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder a new Note in an authorized denomination equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered. 10
6.07. Conversion Arrangement on Call for Redemption. In connection with any redemption of Notes, the Company may arrange for the purchase and conversion of any Notes called for redemption by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other purchasers to purchase such Notes by paying to the Trustee in trust for the Noteholders, on or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, an amount that, together with any amounts deposited with the Trustee by the Company for the redemption of such Notes, is not less than the Redemption Price of such Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Paragraph 6, the obligation of the Company to pay the Redemption Price of such Notes shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged to the extent such amount is so paid by such purchasers. If such an agreement is entered into, any Notes not duly surrendered for conversion by the Holders thereof may, at the option of the Company, be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, acquired by such purchasers from such Holders and (notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 9) surrendered by such purchasers for conversion, all as of immediately prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, subject to payment of the above amount as aforesaid. The Trustee shall hold and pay to the Holders whose Notes are selected for redemption any such amount paid to it for purchase and conversion in the same manner as it would monies deposited with it by the Company for the redemption of Notes. Without the Trustee's prior written consent, no arrangement between the Company and such purchasers for the purchase and conversion of any Notes shall increase or otherwise affect any of the powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations of the Trustee as set forth in the Indenture, and the Company agrees to indemnify the Trustee from, and hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense arising out of or in connection with any such arrangement for the purchase and conversion of any Notes between the Company and such purchasers, including the costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee in the defense of any claim or liability arising out of or in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations under the Indenture, except in the case of the Trustee's negligence or bad faith. 6.08. Exchange and Registration. The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of any Note (i) during the 15-day period immediately preceding the mailing of any notice of redemption of any Note, (ii) after any notice of redemption has been given to Holders of Notes, except, where such notice provides that such Note is to be redeemed only in part, the Company shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of the portion thereof not to be redeemed, (iii) that has been surrendered for conversion pursuant to Paragraph 9 hereof or (iv) as to which a Repurchase Notice has been delivered pursuant to Paragraph 7 hereof and not withdrawn, except where such Repurchase Notice provides that such Note is to be purchased only in part, the Company shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of the portion thereof not to be purchased. 7. Repurchase of Notes at Option of the Holder Upon a Fundamental Change. The Notes shall be subject to repurchase at the option of the Holders upon the following terms and conditions: 7.01. General. If prior to December 1, 2007 there shall have occurred a Fundamental Change, the Notes shall be purchased by the Company, at the Repurchase Price on a date that is not less than 25 days nor more than 35 days after the date of the mailing of the 11
Company Notice under subparagraph 7.03 (the "Repurchase Date"), at the option of the Holder thereof, upon: (a) delivery to the Paying Agent by the Holder of a written notice of purchase (a "Repurchase Notice"), substantially in the form of Annex B hereto, at any time from the opening of business on the date of the Company Notice (as defined below) until the close of business on a date that is 5 Business Days prior to the Repurchase Date stating: (i) the certificate number of the Note which the Holder will deliver to be purchased; (ii) the portion of the principal amount of the Note which the Holder will deliver to be purchased, which portion must be in a principal amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof; (iii) that such Note shall be purchased as of the Repurchase Date pursuant to the terms and conditions specified in the Notes and in the Indenture; and (b) delivery of such Note to the Paying Agent for cancellation prior to, on or after the Repurchase Date (together with all necessary endorsements) at the offices of the Paying Agent, such delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Repurchase Price therefor; provided, however, that such Repurchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Paragraph 7 only if the Note so delivered to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects to the description thereof in the related Repurchase Notice. The Company shall purchase from the Holder thereof, pursuant to this Paragraph 7, a portion of a Note if the principal amount of such portion is $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 if so requested by the Holder. Provisions of the Indenture that apply to the purchase of all of a Note also apply to the purchase of such portion of such Note. Any purchase by the Company contemplated pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph 7 shall be consummated by the delivery of the consideration to be received by the Holder promptly following the later of the Repurchase Date and the time of delivery of the Note. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Holder delivering to the Paying Agent the Repurchase Notice contemplated by this subparagraph 7.01 shall have the right to withdraw such Repurchase Notice at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Repurchase Date by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent in accordance with subparagraph 7.05 hereof. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof. A "Fundamental Change" shall be deemed to have occurred at such time as any of the following events shall occur: (i) there is a Change in Control; or 12
(ii) the common stock into which the Notes are convertible is neither listed for trading on a United States national Notes exchange nor approved for trading on the Nasdaq National Market System or another established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States. A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred when (i) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of shares representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in elections of directors of the Company (the "Voting Stock"); (ii) approval by stockholders of the Company of any plan or proposal for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company; (iii) the Company (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or any other Person merges into the Company, and in the case of any such transaction, the outstanding Common Stock of the Company is changed or exchanged into other assets or securities as a result, unless the stockholders of the Company immediately before such transaction own, directly or indirectly immediately following such transaction, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such transaction in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Voting Stock immediately before such transaction, or (B) conveys, transfers or leases all or substantially all of its assets to any Person; or (iv) any time Continuing Directors do not constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if applicable, a successor Person to the Company); provided that a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred if either (x) the Closing Price (as defined in subparagraph 9.05 hereof) of the Common Stock for any 5 Trading Days (as defined in subparagraph 9.05 hereof) during the 10 Trading Days immediately preceding the Change in Control is at least equal to 105% of the Conversion Price (as defined in the Form of Note) in effect on the date on which the Change in Control occurs or (y) in the case of a merger or consolidation otherwise constituting a Change in Control, all of the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares) in such merger or consolidation constituting the Change in Control consists of common stock traded on a United States national securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System (or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such Change in Control) and as a result of such transaction or transactions the Notes become convertible solely into such common stock. 7.02. Payment of Repurchase Price. The Notes to be purchased pursuant to subparagraph 7.01 shall be paid for in cash. 7.03. Notice of Fundamental Change. Within 25 days after the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Company shall mail a written notice of Fundamental Change (the "Company Notice") by first-class mail to the Trustee and to each Holder (and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law). The notice shall include a form of Repurchase Notice to be completed by the Noteholder and shall state: (i) the events causing a Fundamental Change and the date of such Fundamental Change; (ii) the date by which the Repurchase Notice pursuant to this Paragraph 7 must be given; 13
(iii) the Repurchase Date; (iv) the Repurchase Price; (v) the name and address of the Paying Agent and the Conversion Agent; (vi) the Conversion Price applicable on the date of the Company Notice; (vii) that Notes as to which a Repurchase Notice has been given may be converted pursuant to Paragraph 9 hereof only if the Repurchase Notice has been withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; (viii) that Notes must be surrendered to the Paying Agent for cancellation to collect payment; (ix) that the Repurchase Price for any Note as to which a Repurchase Notice has been duly given and not withdrawn will be paid promptly following the later of the Repurchase Date and the time of surrender of such Note as described in (viii); (x) the procedures the Holder must follow to exercise rights under this Paragraph 7; (xi) the conversion rights of the Notes; (xii) the procedures for withdrawing a Repurchase Notice; (xiii) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment of such Repurchase Price, interest on Notes covered by any Repurchase Notice will cease to accrue on and after the Repurchase Date; and (xiv) the CUSIP number of the Notes. At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give such Company Notice in the Company's name and at the Company's expense; provided, however, that, in all cases, the text of such Company Notice shall be prepared by the Company. 7.04. Procedure upon Purchase. The Company shall deposit cash, at the time and in the manner as provided in subparagraph 7.06 hereof, sufficient to pay the aggregate Repurchase Price of all Notes to be purchased pursuant to this Paragraph 7. 7.05. Effect of Repurchase Notice. Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of the Repurchase Notice specified in subparagraph 7.01 hereof, the Holder of the Note in respect of which such Repurchase Notice was given shall (unless such Repurchase Notice is withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs) thereafter be entitled to receive solely the Repurchase Price with respect to such Note. Such Repurchase Price shall be paid to such Holder, subject to 14
receipt of funds by the Paying Agent, promptly following the later of (x) the Repurchase Date with respect to such Note (provided the conditions in subparagraph 7.01 hereof have been satisfied) and (y) the time of delivery of such Note to the Paying Agent by the Holder thereof in the manner required by subparagraph 7.01. Notes in respect of which a Repurchase Notice has been given by the Holder thereof may not be converted pursuant to Paragraph 9 hereof on or after the date of the delivery of such Repurchase Notice unless such Repurchase Notice has first been validly withdrawn as specified in the following two paragraphs. A Repurchase Notice may be withdrawn by means of a written notice of withdrawal delivered to the office of the Paying Agent in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Notice at any time prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Repurchase Date specifying: (i) the certificate number of the Note in respect of which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; (ii) the principal amount of the Note with respect to which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted; and (iii) the principal amount, if any, of such Note which remains subject to the original Repurchase Notice and which has been or will be delivered for repurchase by the Company. There shall be no purchase of any Notes pursuant to Paragraph 7 if there has occurred (prior to, on or after, as the case may be, the giving, by the Holders of such Notes, of the required Repurchase Notice) and is continuing an Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of the Repurchase Price with respect to such Notes). The Paying Agent will promptly return to the respective Holders thereof any Notes (x) with respect to which a Repurchase Notice has been withdrawn in compliance with the Indenture, or (y) held by it during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of the Repurchase Price with respect to such Notes) in which case, upon such return, the Repurchase Notice with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. 7.06. Deposit of Repurchase Price. Prior to 10:00 a.m. (local time in The City of New York) on the Business Day following the Repurchase Date the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them is acting as the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust as provided herein) an amount of money (in immediately available funds if deposited on such Business Day) sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price of all the Notes or portions thereof which are to be repurchased as of the Repurchase Date. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of any deposits of cash made pursuant to this subparagraph 7.06. 7.07. Notes Repurchased in Part. Any Note which is to be repurchased only in part shall be surrendered at the office of the Paying Agent (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and 15
deliver to the Holder of such Note, without service charge, a new Note or Notes, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to, and in exchange for, the portion of the principal amount of the Note so surrendered which is not repurchased. 7.08. Covenant to Comply With Securities Laws Upon Repurchase of Notes. In connection with any repurchase of Notes under this Paragraph 7 (provided that such offer or repurchase constitutes an "issuer tender offer" for purposes of Rule 13e-4 (which term, as used herein, includes any successor provision thereto) under the Exchange Act at the time of such offer or purchase), the Company shall (i) comply with Rule 13e-4 and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, (ii) file the related Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report) under the Exchange Act, and (iii) otherwise comply with all federal and state securities laws so as to permit the rights and obligations under this Paragraph 7 to be exercised in the time and in the manner specified herein. 7.09. Repayment to the Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall return to the Company any cash that remains unclaimed, together with interest or dividends, if any, thereon, held by them for the payment of the Repurchase Price; provided, however, that to the extent that the aggregate amount of cash deposited by the Company pursuant to subparagraph 7.06 exceeds the aggregate Repurchase Price of the Notes or portions thereof which the Company is obligated to repurchase as of the Repurchase Date then on the Business Day following the Repurchase Date the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall return any such excess to the Company. 8. Article 8 of the Base Indenture shall not apply to the Notes. Instead the following provisions shall apply and references to Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.05 in the Base Indenture shall be read to refer respectively to subparagraphs 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 herein: 8.01. Satisfaction and Discharge. The Indenture shall cease to be of further effect only with respect to the Notes (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, when (a) either (i) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (A) Notes which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 2.07 of the Base Indenture and (B) Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited with the Trustee in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust as provided in subparagraph 8.03 hereof have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (ii) all such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable and the Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an 16
amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness evidenced by such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal and interest to the date of such deposit; (b) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (c) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 7.07 of the Base Indenture and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (ii) of clause (a) of this subparagraph 8.01, the obligations of the Trustee under subparagraphs 8.02 and 8.03 hereof shall survive. 8.02. Application of Trust Money. Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 8.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subparagraph 8.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and the Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee. 8.03. Repayment to the Company. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the making of payments in respect of any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such payment has become due shall be paid to the Company upon written request by the Company, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining shall be repaid to the Company. 9. Conversion. The Notes shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock of the Company upon the following terms and conditions: 9.01. Conversion Privilege. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, each Holder shall have the right, at its option, at any time following the Issue Date of the Notes hereunder through the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of the Stated Maturity of the Notes (except that with respect to any Notes or portion thereof which shall be called for 17
redemption, such right shall terminate except as provided in subparagraph 9.02 or 6.07 hereof, at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the date fixed for redemption of such Notes or portion thereof unless the Company shall default in payment due upon redemption thereof) to convert the principal amount of any such Notes, or any portion of such principal amount which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing the principal amount of the Notes or portion thereof surrendered for conversion by the Conversion Price in effect at such time, by surrender of the Notes so to be converted in whole or in part, together with any required funds, in the manner provided in subparagraph 9.02. A Holder of Notes is not entitled to any rights of a Holder of Common Stock until such Holder has converted such Holder's Notes to Common Stock, and only to the extent such Notes are deemed to have been converted to Common Stock under this Paragraph 9. A Note with respect to which a Holder has delivered a notice in accordance with subparagraph 7.03 hereof regarding such Holder's election to require the Company to repurchase such Holder's Notes on a Repurchase Date may be converted in accordance with this Paragraph 9 only if such Holder withdraws such notice by delivering a written notice of withdrawal to the Company prior to the close of business on the last Business Day prior to such Repurchase Date. 9.02. Exercise of Conversion Privilege; Issuance of Common Stock on Conversion; No Adjustment for Interest or Dividends. In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any Notes in certificated form, the Holder of any such Notes to be converted in whole or in part shall surrender such Notes, duly endorsed, at the office of the Conversion Agent, accompanied by the funds, if any, required by the penultimate paragraph of this subparagraph 9.02, and shall give written notice of conversion in the form provided on the Notes (or such other notice which is acceptable to the Company) (the "Conversion Notice") to the Conversion Agent that the Holder elects to convert such Notes or the portion thereof specified in said notice. Such notice shall also state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such conversion shall be issued, and shall be accompanied by transfer taxes, if required pursuant to subparagraph 9.07. All such Notes surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration of such Notes, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder or his duly authorized attorney. In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect to any interest in Notes in global form, the Holder must complete the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to the Depositary's book-entry conversion program, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company or the Trustee or Conversion Agent, and pay the funds, if any, required by this subparagraph 9.02 and any transfer taxes if required pursuant to subparagraph 9.07. As promptly as practicable after satisfaction of the requirements for conversion set forth above (but in no event later than 3 Business Days after satisfaction of such requirements for conversion), subject to compliance with any restrictions on transfer if shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in a name other than that of the Holder (as if such transfer were a 18
transfer of the Notes (or portion thereof) so converted), the Company shall issue and shall deliver to such Holder at the office of the Conversion Agent, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such Notes or portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph 9 and a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such conversion, as provided in subparagraph 9.03. In case any Notes of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Notes so surrendered, without charge to him, new Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes. Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any such Notes (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set forth above in this subparagraph 9.02 have been satisfied as to such Notes (or portion thereof), and the person in whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date the Holder of record of the shares represented thereby; provided, however, that in case of any such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, the person or persons in whose name the certificate or certificates for such shares are to be issued shall be deemed to have become the record Holder thereof for all purposes on the next day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in effect on the date upon which such Notes shall be surrendered. Unless a Holder converts Notes on an Interest Payment Date and except as described below, such Holder will not receive any accrued interest upon conversion, and any accrued interest on such Notes shall be deemed to be cancelled, extinguished and forfeited upon conversion. All Notes or portions thereof surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on the Regular Record Date for any Interest Payment Date to the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the following Interest Payment Date shall (unless such Notes or portion thereof being converted shall have been called for redemption on a Redemption Date which occurs during the period from the close of business on such Regular Record Date to the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the following Interest Payment Date) be accompanied by payment, in funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount being converted; provided, however, that no such payment need be made if there shall exist at the time of conversion a default in the payment of interest on the Notes. No payment or other adjustment shall be made for accrued dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of the Notes as provided in this Paragraph 9. Upon the conversion of an interest in Global Securities, the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company) shall make a notation on such Global Securities as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee. 9.03. Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares. The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. If multiple Notes shall be 19
surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. If any fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any Notes, the Company shall make an adjustment and payment therefor in cash at the current market value thereof to the Holder of Notes. The current market value of a fraction of a share of Common Stock shall be determined by multiplying the average of Closing Prices (as defined in subparagraph 9.05(g)) of such Common Stock in the 5 Trading Days (as defined in subparagraph 9.05(g)) before the date of conversion by such fraction and rounding the product to the nearest whole cent. 9.04. Conversion Price. The conversion price shall be as specified in the Note (herein called the "Conversion Price"), subject to adjustment as provided in this Paragraph 9. 9.05. Adjustment of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows: (a) In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all Holders of the outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this subparagraph 9.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (b) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all Holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or Notes convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share (or having a conversion price per share) less than the Current Market Price (as defined below) on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the number of shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at such Current Market Price (as defined below) (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered, which shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such 20
convertible securities by the conversion price per share of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of such convertible securities), and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase or into which convertible securities so offered are convertible; provided, however, the Company may, at its option and in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, elect to distribute or reserve for distribution the pro rata portion of such rights or warrants so that each Holder of Notes shall receive, or shall have the right to receive upon conversion, as the case may be, the amount of such rights or warrants that such Holder of Notes would have received if such Holder of Notes had converted such Notes on the date fixed for determination of stockholders to receive such rights or warrants. Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. To the extent that shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) are not delivered, after the expiration of such rights or warrants the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered (or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible securities actually issued). In the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the Holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants or to be received upon exercise of such rights or warrants, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. (c) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective. (d) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all Holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock of the Company (other than any dividends or distributions to which subparagraph 9.05(a) applies) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants referred to in subparagraph 9.05(b), and excluding any dividend or distribution (x) paid 21
exclusively in cash or (y) referred to in subparagraph 9.05(a)) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in this subparagraph 9.05(d) called the "Distributed Securities"), then, in each such case, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall be equal to the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on such Record Date less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of the portion of the Distributed Securities so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, such reduction to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this subparagraph 9.05(d) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes pursuant to this Paragraph 9 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of common stock or preferred stock purchase rights, if any, as may be provided by the terms of any stockholder rights plan adopted by the Company (notwithstanding the occurrence of an event causing such rights to separate from the Common Stock at or prior to the time of conversion). Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a stockholder rights plan complying with the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants for the purposes of subparagraph 9.05(b) or this subparagraph 9.05(d). Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all Holders of Common Stock entitling the Holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events ("Trigger Event"): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this subparagraph 9.05 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Price under this subparagraph 9.05 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Price shall be made under this subparagraph 9.05(d). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of the Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the Holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of 22
calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Price under this subparagraph 9.05 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any Holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a Holder or Holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such Holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all applicable Holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any Holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued. For purposes of this subparagraph 9.05(d) and subparagraphs 9.05(a) and (b), any dividend or distribution to which this subparagraph 9.05(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants (and any Conversion Price reduction required by this subparagraph 9.05(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Price reduction required by subparagraphs 9.05(a) and (b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of subparagraphs 9.05(a) and (b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of subparagraph 9.05(a). (e) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all Holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed upon a merger or consolidation to which subparagraph 9.06 applies or as part of a distribution referred to in subparagraph 9.05(d)), in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (1) the aggregate amount of any other such distributions to all Holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph 9.05(e) has been made, and (2) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) of consideration payable in respect of any tender offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution, and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to subparagraph 9.05(f) has been made, exceeds 12.5% of the product of the Current Market Price on the Record Date with respect to such distribution times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, and in each such case, immediately after 23
the close of business on such date, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business on such Record Date by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on the Record Date less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the excess of such combined amount over such 12.5% and (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price on such date; provided, however, that in the event the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder converted such Note (or portion thereof) immediately prior to such Record Date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Any cash distribution to all Holders of Common Stock as to which the Company makes the election permitted by subparagraph 9.05(m) and as to which the Company has complied with the requirements of such subparagraph shall be treated as not having been made for all purposes of this subparagraph 9.05(e)). (f) In case a tender offer made by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders (based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of Purchased Shares (as defined below)) of an aggregate consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) that combined together with (1) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose good faith determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors), as of the expiration of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender offers, by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion of the Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph 9.05(f) has been made and (2) the aggregate amount of any distributions to all Holders of the Common Stock made exclusively in cash within 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to subparagraph 9.05(e) has been made, exceeds 12.5% of the product of the Current Market Price as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to close of business on the date of the Expiration Time by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time multiplied by the 24
Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time and the denominator shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender offer) of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased Shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) at the Expiration Time and the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, such reduction (if any) to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the Expiration Time. In the event that the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such tender offer had not been made. If the application of this subparagraph 9.05(f) to any tender offer would result in an increase in the Conversion Price, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer under this subparagraph 9.05(f). Any cash distribution to all Holders of Common Stock as to which the Company has made the election permitted by subparagraph 9.05(m) and as to which the Company has complied with the requirements of such subparagraph shall be treated as not having been made for all purposes of this subparagraph 9.05(f). (g) For purposes of this subparagraph 9.05, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated: (1) "Closing Price" with respect to any securities on any day shall mean the closing sale price, regular way, on such day or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in each case on the principal national securities exchange or quotation system on which such security is quoted or listed or admitted to trading, or, if not quoted or listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange or quotation system, the average of the closing bid and asked prices of such security on the over-the-counter market on the day in question as reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or a similar generally accepted reporting service, or if not so available, in such manner as furnished by any New York Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Board of Directors for that purpose, or a price determined in good faith by the Board of Directors whose determination shall be conclusive. (2) "Current Market Price" shall, for the purposes of any computation under subparagraphs 9.05 (b), (d), (e) and (f) above relating to the current market price per share of Common Stock at a specified date, mean the average of the Closing Prices for the 10 consecutive Trading Days (as defined below) preceding the day before the record date (or, if earlier, the ex-dividend date) with respect to any distribution, issuance or other event requiring such computation. 25
(3) "fair market value" shall mean the amount which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arm's length transaction. (4) "Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the Holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). (5) "Trading Day" shall mean (x) if the applicable security is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market System, a day on which trades may be made on thereon or (y) if the applicable security is listed or admitted for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or another national security exchange, a day on which the New York Stock Exchange or such other national security exchange is open for business or (z) if the applicable security is not so listed, admitted for trading or quoted, any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. (h) The Company may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by subparagraphs 9.05(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to Holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may reduce the Conversion Price by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days, the reduction is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such reduction would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Price is reduced pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Notes a notice of the reduction at least 15 days prior to the date the reduced Conversion Price takes effect, and such notice shall state the reduced Conversion Price and the period during which it will be in effect. (i) No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph 9.05(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Paragraph 9 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. To the extent the Notes become 26
convertible into cash, assets, property or securities (other than capital stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash, assets, property or such Notes. Interest will not accrue on the cash. (j) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Conversion Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Price and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Price of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Price setting forth the adjusted Conversion Price and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Price to each Holder of Notes at such Holder's last address appearing on the list of Securityholders provided for in Section 2.05 of the Base Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment. (k) In any case in which this subparagraph 9.05 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a Record Date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Holder of any Notes converted after such Record Date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to subparagraph 9.03. (l) For purposes of this subparagraph 9.05, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (m) In lieu of making any adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to subparagraph 9.05(e) or 9.05(f), the Company may elect to reserve an amount of cash for distribution to the Holders of the Notes upon the conversion of the Notes so that any such Holder converting Notes will receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock and other items to which such Holder is entitled, the full amount of cash which such Holder would have received if such Holder had, immediately prior to the Record Date for such distribution of cash or the Expiration Time of the tender offer, as the case may be, converted its Notes into Common Stock, together with any interest accrued with respect to such amount, in accordance with this subparagraph 9.05(m). The Company may make such election by providing an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee to such effect on or prior to the payment date for any such distribution and depositing with the Trustee on or prior to such date an amount of cash equal to the aggregate amount the Holders of the Notes would have received if such Holders had, immediately prior to the 27
Record Date for such distribution or the Expiration Time, as the case may be, converted all of the Notes into Common Stock. Any such funds so deposited by the Company with the Trustee shall be invested by the Trustee pursuant to written direction by the Company in marketable obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the United States government with a maturity not more than 3 months from the date of issuance. Upon conversion of Notes by a Holder, the Holder will be entitled to receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, an amount of cash equal to the amount such Holder would have received if such Holder had, immediately prior to the Record Date for such distribution or the Expiration Time, as the case may be, converted its Note into Common Stock, along with such Holder's pro rata share of any accrued interest earned as a consequence of the investment of such funds. Promptly after making an election pursuant to this subparagraph 9.05(m), the Company shall give or shall cause to be given notice to all Noteholders of such election, which notice shall state the amount of cash per $1,000 principal amount of Notes such Holders shall be entitled to receive (excluding interest) upon conversion of the Notes as a consequence of the Company having made such election. 9.06. Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale. If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination, or any other change for which an adjustment is provided in subparagraph 9.05(c)), (ii) any consolidation or merger or combination to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other person as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the TIA as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing that such Notes shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Notes (assuming, for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock available to convert all such Notes) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the purposes of this subparagraph 9.06, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the 28
kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Paragraph 9. The above provisions of this subparagraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances. If this subparagraph 9.06 applies to any event or occurrence, subparagraph 9.05 shall not apply. 9.07. Taxes on Shares Issued. The issue of stock certificates on conversions of Notes shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, transfer, stamp or any similar tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the Holder of any Notes converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. 9.08. Reservation of Shares; Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock. The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion. Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Notes shall be newly issued shares or Treasury shares, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and shall be free from preemptive rights and free from any lien or adverse claim. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to list or cause to have quoted any shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of Notes on each national securities exchange or over-the-counter or other domestic market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted. 9.09. Responsibility of Trustee. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Notes to determine the Conversion Price or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Notes; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be 29
responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Notes for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Paragraph 9. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to subparagraph 9.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such subparagraph 9.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01 of the Base Indenture, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. 9.10. Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions. In case, (i) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Price pursuant to subparagraph 9.05; or (ii) the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all or substantially all of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants; or (iii) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries; or (iv) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries; the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Holder of Notes at such Holder's address appearing on the list of Securityholders provided for in Section 2.05 of the Base Indenture, as promptly as practicable but in any event at least 15 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for Notes or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the 30
legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 10. Certain Definitions.

Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
