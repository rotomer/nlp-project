The Company also agrees to indemnify as provided in this Section 6(a) or contribute as provided in Section 6(d) hereof to Losses of each underwriter, if any, of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or agents and each person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Initial Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 6(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof.
 
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity) severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs such Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any such Holder may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party, retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel (including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
provided
however
 
legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, liability, damage or action) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; , , that in no case shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Security, or in the case of a New Security, applicable to the Security that was exchangeable into such New Security, as set forth in the Final Memorandum, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final Memorandum. Benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions as set forth on the cover page of the Final Memorandum, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Securities or New Securities, as applicable, registered under the Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that
provided
however
 
it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
(e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
 
7. . (a) If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders.
Underwritten Registrations
 
(b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement, unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements; and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
 
8. . If any of the following events shall occur, then the Company shall pay liquidated damages (the "Registration Default Damages") to the Holders of Securities in respect of the Securities as follows:
Registration Defaults
 
(a) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the date specified for such filing in this Agreement; or
 
(b) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the date by which commercially reasonable efforts are to be used to cause such effectiveness under this Agreement; or
 
(c) if the Registered Exchange Offer has not been consummated on or prior to the date by which commercially reasonable efforts are to be used to cause such consummation under this Agreement; or
 
(d) if any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective but (i) ceases to be effective at any time at which it is required to be effective
 
under this Agreement, or (ii) ceases to be usable in connection with resales of the New Securities in accordance with and during the periods specified in this Agreement, other than as permitted pursuant to Section 3(b)(ii) or Section 4(k)(ii),
 
(each such event a "Registration Default" and each period during which a Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, a "Registration Default Period"), then, as liquidated damages for such Registration Default, additional interest will accrue on the aggregate principal amount of the New Securities (in addition to the stated interest on the New Securities) from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to, but excluding, the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured. Additional interest will accrue at an initial rate of 0.25% per annum, which rate shall increase by 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period during which such Registration Default continues up to a maximum of 1.00% per annum. If, after the cure of all Registration Defaults then in effect, there is a subsequent Registration Default, the rate of additional interest for such subsequent Registration Default shall initially be 0.25% regardless of the rate in effect with respect to any prior Registration Default at the time of cure of such Registration Default.
 
9. . The Company has not entered into, and agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements
 
10. . The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Registrable Securities outstanding; that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent is to be effective; , , that no amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 8 hereof shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder; and , , that the provisions of this Article 10 may not be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the Initial Purchasers and each Holder. Notwithstanding the foregoing (except the foregoing provisos), a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, are being sold pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by the Majority Holders, determined on the basis of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, being sold rather than registered under such Registration Statement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE: AMD) today announced that it has closed a private offering of $600 million of 7.75 percent Senior Notes due in 2012. AMD intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, approximately $587 million, together with existing cash, to prepay the full amount owed by AMD's indirect wholly-owned German subsidiary, AMD Saxony Limited Liability Company & Co. KG, under its existing term loan.
SUNNYVALE, CA  October 29, 2004 
 
The Senior Notes were sold to qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The new Senior Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
 
The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 7.75 percent per year and mature on November 1, 2012. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning May 1, 2005.
 
Prior to November 1, 2008, AMD may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a "make-whole" premium. Thereafter, AMD may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time for cash at specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to November 1, 2007, AMD may redeem up to 35 percent of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings at 107.75 percent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
Holders of the Senior Notes have the right to require AMD to repurchase all or a portion of the Senior Notes in the event that the company undergoes a change of control at a repurchase price of 101 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
