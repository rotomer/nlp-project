Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
 
On November 15, 2004, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") agreed with a holder of its 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2007 (the "4.50% Notes") to exchange $44.0 million of its 4.50% Notes for 6,267,149 shares of its Common Stock. On November 15, 2004, the Company agreed with another holder of its 4.50% Notes to exchange $27.0 million of its 4.50% Notes for 3,825,500 shares of its Common Stock. The Company expects these transactions to settle on November 18, 2004. The shares of Common Stock were issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a result of these transactions, the Company expects to recognize a non-cash charge of approximately $9.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2004 equal to the fair value of the shares of Common Stock issued in the transactions in excess of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the 4.50% Notes.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
