Item 8.01 Other Events
 
On March 1, 2005, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2004 (the "Report"). The first sentence in the section entitled "Outlook" on page 49 of the Report contained an inadvertent omission with respect to the Company's expectations for its Computation Products segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The corrected sentence is as follows:
 
During the first quarter of 2005, for our Computation Products segment, we expect net sales to be flat to down slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
