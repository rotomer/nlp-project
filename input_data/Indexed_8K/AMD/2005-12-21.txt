ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
 
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (the "") formerly majority-owned subsidiary Spansion LLC (""), formerly 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by Fujitsu Limited (""), was reorganized into Spansion Inc. (the "") and on December 15, 2005, Spansion Inc. ("") commenced its underwritten initial public offering (the "") of its Class A common stock.

Reorganization
Spansion
IPO
 
The Reorganization from Spansion LLC into Spansion Inc. occurred through the following steps. First, AMD Investments, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, contributed its 60 percent ownership interest in Spansion LLC to Spansion Inc. in exchange for 43,529,402 shares of Class A common stock and one share of Class B common stock of Spansion. Fujitsu contributed all of the outstanding capital stock of Fujitsu Microelectronics Holding, Inc. (""), the wholly-owned Fujitsu subsidiary that held Fujitsu's 40 percent ownership interest in Spansion LLC, to Spansion in exchange for one share of Class C common stock and 29,019,601 shares of Class D common stock of Spansion. FMH was then renamed Spansion Technology Inc. ("") and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spansion. As a result, Spansion became the holding company that both directly and indirectly, through STI, owns all of the interests in the operating company subsidiary, Spansion LLC.

STI
 
In the IPO, Spansion offered 47,264,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $12.00 per share pursuant to an effective Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-124041) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Spansion intends to use the net proceeds, after deducting underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses, of approximately $529 million for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.
 
In connection with the IPO, Fujitsu cancelled $40 million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under Spansion LLC's promissory note issued to Fujitsu on June 30, 2003, in exchange for 3,333,333 shares of Spansion's Class D common stock, and the Company cancelled $60 million of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under Spansion LLC's promissory note issued to the Company on June 30, 2003, in exchange for 5,000,000 shares of Spansion's Class A common stock.
 
Agreements with Spansion and Fujitsu related to the Reorganization
 
In connection with the Reorganization, the Company entered into agreements with Spansion and Fujitsu, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference to the following agreements filed as exhibits hereto:
 
Stockholders Agreement
 
The Company entered into a Stockholders Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2005, with the Spansion and Fujitsu, a copy of which is filed as hereto and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Stockholders Agreement imposes certain restrictions and obligations on the Company and Fujitsu with respect to their respective shares of Spansion's common stock and provides for certain matters pertaining to Spansion's management and governance.
Exhibit 10.1
 
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Company and Fujitsu agree to vote all shares of common stock held by them or their affiliates so as to cause:
 
 
 
 
 
Spansion agrees to allow the Company or Fujitsu, as the case may be, to have one representative attend Spansion's Board meetings as a non-voting participant for so long as such stockholder owns at least five percent of Spansion's capital stock, on an as converted to common stock basis.
 
The Stockholders Agreement also provides that neither stockholder can transfer any shares, except to majority-owned subsidiaries, until the earlier of one year from the date of the IPO or the conversion of the Class D common stock into Class A common stock. In addition, neither stockholder can transfer shares in an amount equal to or greater than one percent of the then outstanding common stock to any entity whose principal business competes with Spansion, without first obtaining the consent of the non-transferring stockholder, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld after June 30, 2007.
 
The Stockholders Agreement also provides that Spansion will agree with the Company and Fujitsu to provide, subject to limitations, various financial and other information relating to Spansion and to assist them in connection with their respective reporting, disclosure and other obligations. Each party has agreed that it will use any information provided under the agreement, unless otherwise made public, only in connection with these obligations and that it will not use the information for any other purpose, including in connection with the sale or purchase of securities issued by Spansion.
 
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Spansion has agreed to grant the Company and Fujitsu rights to request Spansion to register all or any part of their shares of Class A common stock under the Securities Act. In addition, subject to limitations, the Company and Fujitsu have rights to request that their shares be included in any registration of Spansion's common stock that Spansion initiates.
 
With the exception of board observer rights and registration rights, the Stockholders Agreement shall terminate when each of the Company's and Fujitsu's aggregate ownership interest in Spansion falls below ten percent.
 
Amended and Restated Patent Cross-License Agreements
 
Spansion was previously party to a patent cross-license agreement with the Company, which was amended and restated as of December 21, 2005. A copy of the Amended and Restated AMD-Spansion Patent Cross-License Agreement is filed as hereto, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 10.2
 
Under the patent cross-license agreement, Spansion granted to the Company, and the Company granted to Spansion, non-exclusive licenses under certain patents and patent applications to make, have
 
made, use, sell, offer to sell, lease, import and otherwise dispose of certain semiconductor-related products anywhere in the world. The patents and patent applications that are licensed are those with an effective filing date occurring between June 30, 2003 and the termination of this Amended and Restated AMD-Spansion Patent Cross-License Agreement. This agreement will automatically terminate on the later of June 30, 2013 and the date the Company sells its entire aggregate ownership interest in Spansion. The agreement may be terminated by a party on a change in control of the other party or its semiconductor group. The licenses to patents under license at the time of the termination will survive until the last such patent expires.
 
In cases where there is a change of control of a party, the other party to the cross-license agreement has the right to terminate the agreement (or to invoke the provisions described in this paragraph if the agreement had been previously terminated) by giving 30 days written notice within 90 days after receiving notice of the change of control. If so terminated, the rights, licenses and immunities granted under the agreement will continue solely with respect to those licensed patents that are entitled to an effective filing date that is on or before, and are licensed as of, the date of such change of control, and will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of such licensed patents. Moreover, with respect to circuit patents, which are patents (other than process patents) covering elements relating to electrical signals to achieve a particular function, the rights, licenses and immunities granted to the party undergoing the change of control are limited solely to:
 
 
 
 
Under the Amended and Restated Patent Cross-License Agreement, Spansion will pay royalties to the Company in the amount of 0.3 percent of net sales of Spansion's products. The royalty rates will be reduced to 0.15 percent at the time Spansion Inc.'s Class D common stock is converted into Class A common stock, and thereafter to zero percent on the second anniversary of the date of such conversion.
 
In the first nine months of fiscal 2005, Spansion paid royalties of approximately $11 million to the Company under the previous patent cross-license agreement. In fiscal 2004, Spansion paid royalties in the amounts of $18 million to the Company under the previous patent cross-license agreement. Spansion will continue to make royalty payments associated with licenses that survive the termination of the agreement.
 
Amended and Restated AMD-Fujitsu Patent Cross-License Agreement
 
AMD and Fujitsu executed an Amended and Restated AMD-Fujitsu Patent Cross-License Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2005, a copy of which is filed as hereto, and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to this agreement, each party was granted a non-exclusive license under certain of the other party's respective semiconductor-related patents. This patent cross-license agreement terminates on June 30, 2013, unless earlier terminated upon 30 days notice following a change of control of the other party.
Exhibit 10.3
 
Amended and Restated Intellectual Property Contribution and Ancillary Matters Agreement
 
The Company and Fujitsu have each contributed to Spansion various intellectual property rights pursuant to an Amended and Restated Intellectual Property Contribution and Ancillary Matters Agreement, a copy of which is filed as hereto.
Exhibit 10.4
 
Under this agreement, Spansion became owner, or joint owner with each of Fujitsu and the Company, of certain patents, patent applications, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights and technology. The Company and Fujitsu reserved rights, on a royalty-free basis, to practice the contributed patents and to license these patents to their affiliates and successors-in-interest to their semiconductor groups. The Company and Fujitsu each have the right to use the jointly-owned intellectual property for their own internal purposes and to license such intellectual property to others to the extent consistent with their non-competition obligations to Spansion. Subject to Spansion's confidentiality obligations to third parties, and only for so long as the Company's and Fujitsu's ownership interest remains above a specific minimum level, Spansion has agreed to identify any of its technology to each of the Company and Fujitsu, and to provide copies of and training with respect to that technology to them. In addition, Spansion has granted a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable fully paid and royalty-free license of Spansion's rights in that technology to each of the Company and Fujitsu.
 
Under this agreement, for as long as the Company continues to hold a majority of Spansion's shares entitled to vote for the election of directors, the Company has agreed to enforce its applicable patents to minimize, to the extent reasonably possible, any of Spansion's losses (whether or not arising out of third-party claims), provided that the details of the manner in which the Company enforces its patents, including which of its patents the Company enforces, is left to the Company's reasonable discretion.
 
The Company may grant licenses under Spansion's patents, provided that these licenses are of no broader scope than, and are subject to the same terms and conditions that apply to, any license of the Company's patents granted in connection with such license, and the recipient of such license grants to Spansion a license of similar scope under its patents. Until the earlier of the December 21, 2007 or when Spansion's Board of Directors adopts a resolution to convert the Spansion Inc. Class D common stock to Spansion Class A common stock, Fujitsu has agreed to consider conditionally granting Spansion an extension of rights under additional Fujitsu patents in circumstances where Spansion can reasonably assert such patents as a claim or counterclaim to third party infringement claims asserted against Spansion.

Spansion has the ability to terminate individual services under the general services agreement at any time and for any reason upon at least six months' advance notice. With respect to the IT service agreement and general administrative service
 
agreement, if the Company has failed to comply with applicable service levels for a particular service and has failed to rectify such performance failure, Spansion may terminate such service after 60 days have elapsed since initial notification of the failure to perform the service. Moreover, Spansion may terminate an entire IT service agreement or general services agreement if the Company breaches its material obligations under the respective agreement and does not cure such default within 90 days after receipt of a notice of default from Spansion. Similarly, the Company can terminate the respective agreement for Spansion's failure to make payments when due if Spansion fails to cure such default within 90 days after receipt of notice of default.
 
For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, the total charges to Spansion for services from the Company were approximately $77 million. For fiscal 2004, the total charges to Spansion for services from the Company were approximately $111 million.
 
The Company and Spansion executed an Amended and Restated Reverse General Administrative Services Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2005, a copy of which is filed as hereto, and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to this agreement, Spansion provides certain research and design services to the Company and Spansion (China) Limited provides manufacturing support services to AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., the Company's microprocessor assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China. For services rendered, Spansion is paid fees generally in an amount equal to cost plus five percent. Unless otherwise earlier terminated, this agreement expires on June 30, 2007, but the parties may extend the term by mutual agreement.

Moreover, the Company may terminate the entire agreement if Spansion breaches its material obligations under the agreement and does not cure such default within 90 days after receipt of a notice of default from the Company. Similarly, Spansion can terminate the agreement for the Company's failure to make payments when due if it fails to cure such default within 90 days after receipt of notice of default. For the first nine months of fiscal 2005, the total charge to the Company for these services was approximately $4 million. For fiscal 2004, the total charge to the Company for these services was approximately $5 million.
Exhibit 10.7
 
Amended and Restated Non-Competition Agreement
 
The Company, Fujitsu and Spansion executed an Amended and Restated Non-Competition Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2005, a copy of which is filed as hereto, and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company and Fujitsu each agree not to directly or indirectly engage in a business that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single chip, multiple chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory, which is the business in which Spansion primarily competes. This non-competition agreement does not prevent the Company or Fujitsu from manufacturing or selling products that incorporate Flash memory (whether it be Spansion Flash memory or a competitive product). Furthermore, the Company and Fujitsu each agreed that if either of them acquires a business that has a division or other operations that manufactures or supplies standalone semiconductor devices (including single chip, multiple chip or system devices) containing only Flash memory, the Company and Fujitsu will provide Spansion with a right of first offer to acquire the competing division or operations. The Company and Fujitsu are required to use their commercially reasonable efforts to divest the competing division or operations if Spansion does not purchase them. The non-competition obligations of the Company will last until the earlier of (i) the dissolution of Spansion, and (ii) two years after the date on which the Company's aggregate ownership interest in Spansion is less than or equal to five percent. The non-competition obligations of Fujitsu will last until the earlier of (i) the dissolution of Spansion, and (ii) two years after the date on which Fujitsu's aggregate ownership interest in Spansion is less than or equal to five percent.
Exhibit 10.8
 
Spansion, the Company and Fujitsu also agreed not to solicit each other's employees. Without Spansion's prior written consent, each of the Company and Fujitsu will not directly or indirectly either for itself or another person, (i) hire any individual employed by Spansion or (ii) solicit or encourage any individual to terminate his or her employment with Spansion. These obligations not to solicit or hire do not apply if (A) Spansion has terminated the employment of such individual or (B) at least two years has elapsed since such individual has voluntarily terminated his or her employment with Spansion. Similarly, without the prior written consent of the Company or Fujitsu, Spansion agreed not to directly or indirectly either for itself or another person, (i) hire any individual employed by the Company or Fujitsu or (ii) solicit or encourage any individual to terminate his or her employment with the Company or Fujitsu. These obligations not to solicit or hire do not apply if (A) the Company or Fujitsu, as applicable, has terminated the employment of such individual or (B) at least two years has elapsed since such individual has voluntarily terminated his or her employment with the Company or Fujitsu, as applicable. These non-solicitation obligations of the Company will last until the earlier of (i) the dissolution of Spansion, and (ii) two years after the date on which the Company's aggregate ownership interest in Spansion is less than or equal to five percent. These non-solicitation obligations of Fujitsu will last until the earlier of (i) the dissolution of Spansion, and (ii) two years after the date on which Fujitsu's aggregate ownership interest in Spansion is less than or equal to five percent. These non-solicitation obligations of Spansion with respect to the Company employees or Fujitsu employees will terminate at the same time as the non-solicitation obligations of the Company or Fujitsu, as applicable, terminate.
 
Purchase of Spansion LLC 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016
 
On December 21, 2005, Spansion LLC issued to the Company $175,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 12.75% Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2016. The Company purchased the senior subordinated notes for approximately $158.9 million, at 90.828% of face value. The senior subordinated notes are general unsecured obligations of Spansion LLC and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of Spansion, STI or Spansion LLC. Interest is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year beginning April 15, 2006 until the maturity date of April 15, 2016. Spansion LLC's obligations under the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by Spansion Inc., STI and any restricted subsidiary of Spansion that guarantees any of Spansion's public debt in the future.
 
Certain events are considered "Events of Default" under the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes which may result in the accelerated maturity of the senior subordinated notes, including (i) a default in any interest, principal or premium amount payment; (ii) a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of Spansion LLC's property; (iii) a breach of covenants in the senior subordinated notes or the indenture; (iv) a default in certain debts; or (v) if a court enters certain orders or decrees under any bankruptcy law. Upon occurrence of one of these events, the trustee or certain holders may declare the principal of and accrued interest on the senior subordinated notes to be immediately due and payable. If Spansion, STI or Spansion LLC incurs any judgment for the payment of money in an aggregate amount in excess of $50 million or takes certain voluntary actions in connection to insolvency, all amounts on the senior subordinated notes shall be due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act by the trustee or holders thereof.
 
Spansion LLC used the net proceeds of approximately $159 million from the sale of the senior subordinated notes to pay off a portion of the approximately $276 million outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, under its promissory notes issued to the Company. Spansion LLC used the net proceeds from a concurrent private placement of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 11.75% Senior Notes due 2016 to pay off the remaining balance.
 
Acceleration of AMD Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units held by Spansion Employees
 
On December 15, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding AMD stock options and restricted stock units held by Spansion employees, that would otherwise have vested by December 31, 2006. The number of shares of AMD common stock underlying AMD stock options and restricted stock units subject to acceleration totaled approximately 864,000, of which approximately 150,000 are held by Spansion's executive officers.
 
The primary purpose of the acceleration of vesting of these awards was to minimize future compensation expense that the Company would otherwise be required to recognize in its statement of operations with respect to these awards. If the Company had not accelerated these awards, they would have been subject to variable fair value accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in EITF Issue 96-18 and 00-12. This accounting treatment would have applied because subsequent to Spansion's IPO, the Company no longer consolidates Spansion's results of operations in the Company's financial statements. Accordingly, Spansion employees are no longer considered common law employees of the Company. Under variable fair value accounting, the Company would be required to re-measure the fair value of unvested stock-based awards of AMD common stock held by Spansion employees after Spansion's IPO at the end of each accounting period until such awards become fully vested.
 
The acceleration of the vesting of these awards will result in a compensation charge in the Company's fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, which the Company expects will be immaterial.
 
ITEM 2.01 COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
 
On December 21, 2005, Spansion closed its IPO. Prior to the IPO, the Company's ownership interest in Spansion was 60 percent. As a result of the IPO, the Company's ownership interest in Spansion was diluted by approximately 22.1 percent such that immediately following the IPO the Company's ownership interest was reduced to approximately 37.9 percent. The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from Spansion's IPO.
 
In addition, following the IPO, the Company no longer exercises operating control over Spansion. As a result, the Company will use the equity method of accounting for its investment in Spansion, and it will no longer consolidate the financial position, operating results or cash flows of Spansion from the closing date of the IPO.

in an advisory capacity to Spansion only and will not have independent veto rights or other day-to-day decision-making authority over Spansion's receipt, use and oversight of the Services. The Fujitsu Services Advisor will act in the best interests of Spansion, not Fujitsu. Spansion shall make available to the Fujitsu Services Advisor office space and facilities upon the Fujitsu Services Advisor's reasonable request as and when reasonably required by the Fujitsu Services Advisor to enable the Fujitsu Services Advisor to perform his or her responsibilities hereunder. In the event that Fujitsu's Aggregate Ownership Interest falls below ten percent (10%) and Fujitsu no longer provides services to Spansion that are similar to the Services, either Spansion or Fujitsu may, but shall not be required to, by written notice to the other and AMD, terminate the role of the Fujitsu Services Advisor, and, upon such termination, the Fujitsu Services Advisor shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder.
 
3.5 Spansion shall keep AMD informed about those aspects of Spansion's business that could reasonably be expected to have an effect on the demand for, or provision of, the Services. AMD will provide to the Fujitsu Services Advisor copies of all reports and other written information relating specifically to the Services that AMD provides Spansion herein, at the same time AMD provides such reports and information to Spansion, including a copy of the monthly service reports provided Spansion under Section 4.8. At any time, upon the Fujitsu Services Advisor's reasonable request, the Spansion Services Manager shall provide the Fujitsu Services Advisor additional information regarding the performance of the Services and the associated Fees. AMD and Spansion, through the AMD Services Advisor and the Spansion Services Manager, will give notice, and otherwise keep the Fujitsu Services Advisor informed, of all proposals and discussions between the Spansion Services Manager and the AMD Services Advisor, or their respective supervisors, relating to material aspects of this Agreement and the provision of the Services herein, including all Changes proposed under the Change Control Procedures set forth in Section 3.9, any Special Projects proposed pursuant to Section 5, all audits conducted by Spansion, and all budget meetings relating to the Services or Systems. Such notice shall be given by the Parties promptly upon initiation of such discussions. In addition, AMD and Spansion will, upon the Fujitsu Service Advisor's request and subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions, grant access to the Fujitsu Service Advisor to any meeting, whether telephonic or in-person, between the Spansion Services Manager and the AMD Services Advisor regarding performance of the Services, the Fees, and any proposed Special Projects or Changes.
Information Exchange and Information Rights.
 
3.6 If at any time, the Fujitsu Services Advisor believes in good faith that (a) the Services being provided to Spansion under this Agreement are not being provided in accordance with the applicable Service Levels, (b) AMD is in material breach under this Agreement, (c) an audit pursuant to Section 10.12 should be conducted, or (d) Spansion is not being charged fairly for the Services it is receiving under this Agreement, then the Fujitsu Services Advisor will notify the Spansion Services Manager in writing. If after a reasonable period of time the Fujitsu Services Advisor does not believe that the concern raised has been adequately addressed, the Fujitsu Services Advisor shall be entitled to notify Spansion's Board of Directors (the "") of the Fujitsu Service Advisor's concerns. Any such notice shall be in writing and shall be provided to all Board members simultaneously, with a copy also provided simultaneously to Spansion's chief financial officer and the AMD Services

3.7
Contract Amendments.
 
(a) Spansion and AMD may only amend this Agreement upon the approval of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may delegate its decision-making authority to Spansion management as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that any Special Project, or Systems or Services purchase of greater than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) payable in any Contract Year will require specific approval from the Board of Directors.
 
(b) For so long as Fujitsu maintains at least a ten percent (10%) Aggregate Ownership Interest, AMD and Spansion may not amend this Agreement without the prior written consent of Fujitsu (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) to the extent an amendment: (i) reduces the rights of the Fujitsu Services Advisor; (ii) reduces Fujitsu's right to consent to amendments set forth in this Section; (iii) establishes a basis for charging Spansion for the Services which is different than AMD's reasonable, good faith estimates of actual costs plus five percent (5%), as set forth in Section 10.7, or materially alters the cost allocation methodologies described in Section 10.7; (iv) eliminates or reduces AMD's obligation to treat Spansion on par with other AMD divisions and Affiliates (taking into account that this Agreement provides for a cost plus allocation budgeting structure that may not apply to other AMD divisions or Affiliates); or (v) materially affects Spansion's rights under this Agreement (e.g., eliminates the requirement that all Changes require Spansion's consent). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, changes to Fees or Services resulting from the Change Order Procedures, the Annual Budget Process or the Fee reconciliation process described in Section 10.9 do not constitute amendments of the Agreement for purposes of this Section 3.7.
 
3.8 Spansion shall reasonably cooperate with AMD by making available, as requested by AMD, management decisions, information, approvals or disapprovals, and acceptances or rejections in a reasonably timely manner so that AMD may fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.
Approvals.
 
3.9 The Parties shall use the following procedures (the "") to implement Changes.
Change Control Procedures.
Change Control Procedures
 
(a)
General.
 
(i) Changes shall be implemented only by mutual agreement of the Parties through these Change Control Procedures, except as may be necessary on an emergency, temporary basis to maintain the continuity of the Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the implementation of a Change does not necessarily require an increase in the Fees or other fees payable by Spansion or a reduction in the scope of Services or in Service Levels provided hereunder, and that any change in the Fees or other amounts payable by Spansion as a result of a Change will be an adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 10. All decisions regarding Changes are subject to the approval by the Board of Directors, which may delegate its decision-making authority to Spansion management as it deems appropriate. The Parties acknowledge and agree that not all modifications to the Services
Changes.
 
or Systems may constitute Changes; as part of the routine operation of Spansion and AMD, modifications that are not material or significant, as determined by AMD in its reasonable judgment, may be conducted without recourse to the Change Control Procedures; provided that the Spansion Services Manager is notified  on a regular basis consistent with AMD's internal processes  of the modifications being implemented on Spansion's behalf or that affect Spansion Systems, with a copy of such report provided to the Fujitsu Services Advisor.
 
(ii) Unless otherwise agreed by Spansion, with respect to all Changes, AMD shall (a) schedule Changes so as not to unreasonably interrupt Spansion's business operations, other than those Changes made on a emergency basis to maintain the continuity of the Services, (b) prepare and deliver to Spansion each month a rolling schedule for ongoing and planned agreed upon Changes for the next thirty (30) day period, and (c) monitor the status of Changes against the applicable schedule. AMD shall implement and maintain a continuously updated, electronic log of such emergency Changes that will be accessible to the Spansion Services Manager and the Fujitsu Services Advisor at all times.
Schedule.
 
(iii) The AMD Services Advisor and the Spansion Services Manager shall meet on a mutually agreed schedule (no less frequently than each quarter) for the purpose of reviewing Change requests submitted by either Party in accordance with these Change Control Procedures. The Spansion Services Manager will provide the Fujitsu Services Advisor written notice of this meeting and the Fujitsu Services Advisor may attend.
Meetings.
 
(b) Requests for Changes shall be submitted for review in accordance with the Change Control Procedures, and shall include a reasonably detailed description of the requested Change together with the basis for such Change. All requests for Changes by Spansion shall be communicated to AMD through the Spansion Services Manager, his or her supervisor, or his or her authorized designee.
Requests for Changes.
 
(i) Within ten (10) business days after AMD receives a request from Spansion for a Change, either AMD or a joint project team working on the Service to be impacted, as appropriate, shall prepare and provide to Spansion an initial written proposal for the Change (a ""), which proposal will include AMD's initial proposals regarding (A) the Services and the applicable schedule for performing the Services, including but not limited to Spansion's related obligations, to effect the Change, (B) the applicable Service Levels resulting from the Change, (C) the resources required to perform Services effecting the Change and resulting from the Change, (D) the Fees for Services, and (E) any additional Systems or areas that are reasonably likely to be impacted by the proposed Change. The Change Proposal shall also contain a description of any other anticipated costs that Spansion will incur as a result of the Change that it would otherwise not have incurred. AMD will also indicate the areas of the Change Proposal where additional analysis may be required to complete the Change Proposal. On a schedule to be agreed upon by the Parties in the circumstances, but presumed not to exceed thirty (30) days after receipt of Spansion's request, AMD will deliver to Spansion a completed Change Proposal. Within ten (10) business days after receiving such Change Proposal, Spansion shall either approve the Change Proposal, notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further, or withdraw the request for such Change. Spansion's failure to approve the Change Proposal or notify AMD that Spansion
Changes Initiated by Spansion.
Change Proposal
 
desires to discuss the Change Proposal further within this ten (10) business day period shall be deemed a rejection of the Change Proposal, and the Change shall not be implemented.
 
(ii) Concurrent with the submission of a request for a Change by AMD, either AMD or a joint project team working on the impacted Service, as appropriate, shall provide to Spansion a Change Proposal containing the information specified in subparagraph (i) above. Within ten (10) business days after receiving such proposal, Spansion shall either approve the Change Proposal, notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further, or reject the requested Change. Spansion's failure to approve the Change Proposal or notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further within this ten (10) business day period shall be deemed a rejection of such request, and the Change shall not be implemented. If Spansion rejects the request or does not respond to the request, then the AMD Services Advisor may notify all members of the Board of Directors by simultaneous notice, with a copy to the Spansion chief financial officer (or other officer who supervises the Spansion Services Manager, if applicable) and to the Fujitsu Services Advisor, of the rejection of the Change Proposal and may request that the Board of Directors determine whether the Change should be made by or for Spansion.
Changes Initiated by AMD.
 
(c) If within ten (10) business days after receipt of a Change Proposal, Spansion notifies AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the proposed Change further, the Spansion Services Manager and AMD Services Advisor will promptly consider the Change Proposal in person or by telephone and will attempt in good faith to develop a mutually acceptable Change Proposal. The Spansion Services Manager will notify the Fujitsu Services Advisor of the proposed meeting and the Fujitsu Services Advisor may attend any such meeting.
Further Discussion of Changes.
 
(d) Notwithstanding any discussions regarding Change Proposals, Spansion shall have the right to request, evaluate and accept proposals from third parties regarding Changes; provided that such Changes are only for Location Based Services and not for Enterprise Services and such Changes do not relate to AMD-proprietary Software or Systems, do not affect the AMD Infrastructure, the provision of Services, and would not result in the breach of an obligation that AMD may have with a third party. Spansion will notify AMD when Spansion is considering seeking proposals from third parties regarding Changes and provide AMD the first opportunity to perform the Change. In the event AMD rejects such Change Proposal, and the Parties, after reasonable negotiations, fail to come to an agreement in connection therewith, Spansion shall have the right to escalate the issue to the Board of Directors.
Outside Bids.
 
(e) All Changes are subject to the written approval of the Parties. Only following receipt of each Party's written approval may AMD begin to implement the approved Change. Costs and fees for performance of additional work to implement the Change, if any, will be invoiced and paid in accordance with the schedule set forth in the agreed-upon Change Proposal; however, any Fee adjustments resulting from the Change will be implemented as part of the quarterly budget reconciliation process set forth in Section 10.9.
Implementation of Changes.
 
(f) If a Service Level failure, reasonable safety concern, Governmental Authority or change in Applicable Law, requires an immediate Change to a System or Service, then AMD may implement such Change immediately upon notice to Spansion, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor. Any change in Fees, any System purchases for which AMD seeks reimbursement from Spansion, or any long-term, material degradation in Service Levels resulting from such Change, unless such degradation is unavoidably required in the circumstances (in which event AMD shall use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such degradation), shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures.
Emergency Changes.
 
 
4.1 AMD, either itself or through its Affiliates or subcontractors (subject to Section 4.6), shall provide the Systems and perform the services, functions, and responsibilities for Spansion identified in Exhibit 4.1 (the ""). Exhibit 4.1 may be updated by the Parties from time to time upon mutual agreement pursuant to the Change Control Procedures or the annual review of the Spansion IT budget and the Services described in Section 10.8 (the ""). The Services will include those services and Systems that AMD will also provide Spansion that AMD also provides on an enterprise-wide basis for AMD facilities generally ("") as well as Spansion Service Location-specific services and Systems that may be unique to any such Service Location (""). AMD will provide Spansion the Services under terms (including those related to charges, cost allocation, service levels and technology) that are at least as favorable as those it provides any other AMD business unit, division or AMD Affiliate receiving similar services from AMD (or an AMD subcontractor), subject to any deviations agreed to by the Parties to address Spansion's specific requirements as communicated to AMD and taking into account that this Agreement provides for a cost plus allocation budgeting structure that may not apply to other AMD divisions or Affiliates. The Services (including any new Services or Systems added pursuant to mutual agreement by the Parties) will evolve and be supplemented, modified, enhanced or replaced, reduced or eliminated over time as agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to the Change Control Procedures or as part of the Annual Budget Process. Fees are subject to the quarterly budget reconciliation process described in Section 10.9.

4.2 Exhibit 4.2 contains a list of any necessary telecommunications systems, software and hardware requirements, including existing and currently-planned and approved upgrades to any of the foregoing, that must be implemented in any Spansion Systems to make such systems compatible with the AMD Infrastructure as of the Effective Date (to the extent such compatibility is necessary for Spansion to receive the Services). Any implementations required under Exhibit 4.2 to the extent necessary for Spansion to receive the Services shall be provided at Spansion's cost (including AMD's mark-up as applicable) and such costs shall be set forth in Exhibit 10 hereto. Spansion acknowledges that for it to receive the benefits intended under this Agreement, including lower costs and conformity with AMD Systems, it must undertake such implementations. Once such implementations have been completed, any unilateral change by Spansion of its systems which results in a material failure to be compliant with the AMD Infrastructure will excuse any AMD failure to perform the affected Service, solely to the extent such failure is caused by such non-compliance, until Spansion restores its compliance, and may result in additional charges to Spansion for AMD to
Compliance with AMD Infrastructure.
 
assist Spansion's return to compliance. AMD agrees to notify Spansion upon AMD's discovery of any such non-compliance and will continue to provide all Services to the extent unaffected by such non-compliance. AMD will provide Spansion advance notice of any AMD Infrastructure changes, including technology upgrades, that may require Spansion to make changes to its own technical architecture.
 
4.3 AMD shall obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for AMD to deliver the Services under this Agreement. Spansion shall obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for Spansion to use the Services under this Agreement. Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall provide to the requesting Party reasonable cooperation and assistance in obtaining Governmental Approvals hereunder.
Governmental Approvals.
 
4.4 If either Party becomes aware of any changes in Law that relate to AMD's delivery of the Services or Spansion's use of the Services, then such Party will notify the other Party of such changes in Law. With respect to any changes related to AMD's delivery of Services, AMD and Spansion shall work together pursuant to the Change Control Procedures to identify the impact of such changes on AMD's delivery of the Services, and any changes in the fees charged to Spansion, as a result and shall work together to implement any necessary modifications to the Services prior to the deadline imposed by the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction for such requirement or change. AMD will use reasonable efforts to minimize the incremental cost to Spansion of compliance with such Laws.
Changes in Law.
 
4.5 AMD shall comply with all Laws governing the provision of the Services and the performance of its obligations, including identifying and procuring permits, certificates, approvals and inspections required under such Laws. If a charge of non-compliance by AMD with any such Laws occurs, AMD shall promptly notify Spansion of such charge in writing and AMD shall promptly remedy such non-compliance in accordance with Law.
Compliance With Laws.
 
4.6 Spansion acknowledges that AMD may outsource to a third party or third parties the performance of some or all of the Services that AMD is obligated to provide under this Agreement; provided however, that in the event such outsourcing will lead to any Change in such Services, such outsourcing shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring AMD to perform any Services outside of the United States and to the extent that Services will be performed outside the United States, AMD may engage an Affiliate, subsidiary or subcontractor to perform such Services (subject to the Change Control Procedures in accordance with the foregoing). No subcontracting shall release AMD from its responsibility for its obligations under this Agreement. AMD shall be responsible for the work and activities of each of the AMD Agents, including compliance with the terms of this Agreement. AMD shall be responsible for all payments to its subcontractors unless the Parties agree that Spansion will pay directly to an AMD Affiliate providing Services to Spansion.
Subcontractors.
 
4.7 AMD will coordinate and cooperate in good faith with Spansion Agents hired by Spansion from time to time to the extent reasonably required by Spansion and with Fujitsu to the extent that Fujitsu supplies similar or complementary services to
Spansion Agents.
 
Spansion. AMD will promptly notify Spansion if Fujitsu or any Spansion Agent act or omission will cause, or has caused, a problem or delay in providing the Services. AMD will be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by the interference of a Spansion Agent or Fujitsu; provided such interference was not at the direction of AMD; and provided that AMD continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such interference and works with Spansion to resolve the problem and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of AMD's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable.
 
4.8 In accordance with the schedules set forth in Exhibit 6.1, or if not specified therein, when AMD generates the reports for itself, but no less frequently than quarterly, AMD shall measure and report to Spansion, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor, AMD's performance of the Services against the applicable Service Levels. Such measurement and monitoring shall permit reporting at a level of detail reasonably sufficient to verify AMD's compliance with the Service Levels; unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, AMD may determine the format and level of detail contained in any such reports (provided such detail is sufficient in accordance with the foregoing). If AMD makes available additional services monitoring reports and/or tools to other AMD business units or AMD Affiliates to monitor and/or report on services similar to the Services, AMD agrees to make such tools and reports available to Spansion. Spansion acknowledges, unless it rejects the offer for such tools and reports, that it will pay any applicable fees or allocated portion of fees to use such additional monitoring tools or obtain such additional reports.
AMD Monitoring and Reporting; Monitoring Tools.
 
4.9 In addition to receiving AMD's Service Level performance report pursuant to Section 4.8, Spansion may also independently analyze AMD's compliance with the Service Levels and provide AMD feedback regarding AMD's performance. If as part of that benchmarking, Spansion in good faith determines that the pricing it is charged for the Services is not within a reasonable range, Spansion may notify AMD and the Parties will consider whether changes are appropriate to the Services to enable the Parties to enjoy better pricing. Any such benchmarking shall be subject to the confidentiality restriction set forth in Section 13. If Spansion requests AMD's participation in the benchmarking process and such participation results in incremental work to be performed by AMD that was not otherwise included in the budget, then AMD will be entitled to charge Spansion at the Spansion T&M Rates or other mutually-agreed rates for AMD's participation in the benchmarking process.
Spansion Benchmarking.
 
 
5.1 Spansion may from time to time during the Term request that AMD perform Special Projects. Upon receipt of such a request from Spansion, AMD shall provide Spansion with a written proposal for such Special Project which shall include:
Special Projects.
 
(a) a description of the services, functions and responsibilities AMD anticipates performing in connection with such Special Project;
 
(b) any impact on Service Levels, Spansion Systems, the AMD Infrastructure or the Enterprise Services, if any, associated with such Special Project;
 
(c) a description of obligations of Spansion, if any, required for AMD to perform such Special Project;
 
(d) a schedule for commencing and completing such Special Project;
 
(e) AMD's prospective Fees for such Special Project, either on a fixed fee or time and materials basis; and
 
(f) when appropriate, a description of any new software or equipment required in connection with such Special Project.
 
AMD shall not begin performing any Special Project until the Parties have agreed in writing upon the specifications, requirements, schedule and Fees for such Special Project pursuant to the Change Control Procedures. If AMD reasonably believes that a proposed Special Project would negatively affect the Services, the AMD Infrastructure, any AMD proprietary Software or AMD's implementation of third party Software, either by reducing its performance or functionality, or increasing the cost to AMD, and Spansion still desires to continue with the Special Project despite AMD's objections, the AMD Services Advisor may submit the matter to the Board of Directors for resolution; provided that any such notice to the Board of Directors must be in writing, must be submitted to all members of the Board of Directors simultaneously, and must also be provided to the Spansion chief financial officer (or other officer supervising the Spansion Services Manager, if applicable) and to the Fujitsu Services Advisor.
 
5.2 Spansion shall have the right to contract with a third party to perform any Special Project, provided that the Special Project is only for Location Based Services and not for Enterprise Services and the Special Project does not relate to AMD-proprietary Software or Systems, does not affect the AMD Infrastructure, the provision of Services, and would not result in the breach of an obligation that AMD may have with a third party. Spansion will notify AMD of any proposal that Spansion wants to make to a third party to perform a Special Project instead of having AMD perform that Special Project. If the Parties do not agree upon terms by which AMD will perform a Special Project, or if AMD objects to Spansion retaining a third party to perform the Special Project because AMD reasonably believes in good faith that such Special Project, or the third party's performance of that Special Project, will negatively affect the Enterprise Services, the AMD Infrastructure, any AMD proprietary Software or AMD's implementation of third party Software, either by reducing its performance or functionality, or increasing the cost to AMD, or by causing AMD to breach an obligation to a third party, each Party shall have the right to escalate the issue to the Board of Directors, and the Parties shall in good faith negotiate a mutually-acceptable resolution to the matter. If Spansion does retain a third party to perform a Special Project hereunder, then AMD and Spansion will agree in writing upon any changes to the Services, Service Levels, Fees or Spansion Systems that result from Spansion retaining the third party and commissioning the Special Project.
Third Party Services.
 
 
6.1 Commencing upon the applicable date identified in Exhibit 4.1 (the ""), AMD shall perform the Services at a minimum in conformance with the Service Levels identified on Exhibit 6.1 (the "").
Service Levels.
Service Level Effective Date
Service Levels
 
6.2 The Parties shall review the Service Levels for the preceding twelve (12) months during the meeting described in Section 10.8, and, (a) with respect to any Service Levels that require periodic adjustment pursuant to this Agreement or are no longer appropriate because of an increase, decrease or change to the Services, shall by mutual agreement adjust the Service Levels for the subsequent Contract Year, and (b) with respect to all other Service Levels, may adjust by mutual agreement the Service Levels for the subsequent Contract Year. In addition, either Party may, at any time upon written notice to the other Party, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor, initiate negotiations to review and adjust any Service Level at any time pursuant to the Change Control Procedures. Any adjustment to the Service Levels made pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall not be considered an amendment to this Agreement for purposes of Section 3.7. If the Parties cannot reach Agreement, then the Service Levels agreed upon for the preceding Contract Year shall continue to apply.
Adjustment of Service Levels.
 
6.3 With respect to any (a) AMD failure to provide the Services in accordance with the applicable Service Levels that gives rise to a Severity Level 1 failure (as defined in Exhibit 6.4), or (b) AMD failure to provide the Services in accordance with the applicable Service Levels that gives rise to a repeated Severity Level 2 failure (as defined in Exhibit 6.4), AMD shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, (x) perform a root-cause analysis to identify the cause of such failure or incident, (y) provide Spansion with a report detailing the cause of, and procedure for correcting, such failure or incident, and (z) implement such procedure for correcting such failure or incident.
Root-Cause Analysis.
 
6.4
Remedies for Failure to Meet Service Levels.
 
(a) Spansion agrees that the remedies available to it in the event of a failure of AMD to provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels should be addressed to correcting problems that resulted in such failure, rather than to penalizing AMD. In recognition of this, (1) a single instance of a failure to meet a Service Level shall not automatically be deemed a material breach by AMD and (2) the Parties agree to follow to procedures set forth in this Section 6.4 as well as Section 6.5 to rectify such failures.
 
(b) For failures to meet the Service Levels or for any other material failure of an AMD-maintained System, AMD will provide the error correction and workaround services detailed in Exhibit 6.4 in accordance with the terms and timelines set forth therein.
 
(c) If, despite the remediation efforts being undertaken as set forth in Exhibit 6.4, the affected Service or Spansion System continues to fail to comply with the applicable Service Level or continues to suffer from a material defect after fifteen (15) days of remediation efforts, then the Parties shall undertake the corrective action process outlined in Section 6.5 below. If no reasonable, mutually-acceptable resolution is achieved after the conclusion of these processes, then Spansion may terminate the affected Service pursuant to Section 16.1.
 
6.5
Dispute Escalation Process.
 
(a) . If the Spansion Services Manager determines that AMD has failed to perform its obligations under Section 6.4 and Exhibit 6.4, the Spansion Services Manager may initiate contact with the AMD Services Advisor to discuss the
Initial Notice; Good Faith Discussion
 
deficiency, and if necessary may submit a Change Proposal regarding a corrective action plan in accordance with the Change Control Procedures. Upon such contact, the Spansion Services Manager and AMD Services Advisor will promptly consider the corrective action plan in person or by telephone and will attempt in good faith to agree to a mutually acceptable corrective action plan. The Spansion Services Manager will invite the Fujitsu Services Advisor to attend any such meetings. If the Parties cannot agree upon a corrective action plan within a fifteen (15) day business day period, the issue will be escalated in accordance with clause (b) below.
 
(b) . If the issue is not resolved in accordance with clause (a) above, the Spansion Services Manager will notify the Spansion chief financial officer or other designated Spansion officer supervising the Spansion Services Manager of the issue. The Spansion chief financial officer or other designated supervising officer will then contact the AMD chief information officer to discuss the issue in person or by telephone and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the issue for a period of ten (10) business days. If the issue is not resolved, as agreed by the Parties, with such ten (10) business day period, the issue will be escalated in accordance with clause (c) below.
Management Escalation
 
(c) . If the Spansion chief financial officer (or other designated Spansion officer) reasonably determines that AMD has failed to offer an acceptable remedy for the material breach, then the Spansion officer shall notify the Board of Directors (a) indicating the nature and the basis of the issue, and (b) listing the measures that Spansion proposes to take against AMD in order to remedy the material breach. The Board of Directors shall consider the measures proposed by the Spansion officer against AMD and shall provide its recommendation or approval for any measures Spansion shall take to remedy the material breach.
Board Escalation
 
(d) . In the event that the unremediated material breach has a material adverse impact on Spansion's business or operations, and subject to Board of Directors approval, Spansion may terminate the affected Service in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 16 (presuming the applicable cure period has elapsed as set forth therein) and shall have the right to contract with a third party to perform such Service.
Termination
 
(e) . In the event that the Board of Directors approves Spansion's proposed measures, and AMD believes that such measures are inappropriate, AMD shall have the right to institute dispute resolution proceedings in accordance with Section 15.
Right to Arbitrate
 
6.6 Spansion acknowledges that no Service Level credits are applicable to a failure by AMD to provide Services in accordance with Service Levels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that if the cost plus arrangement in Section 10 is materially altered so that the Services are provided on commercial terms permitting AMD to achieve profit margins substantially similar to those of a commercial outsourcer providing the same scope of services to Spansion, then the Parties will adopt mutually-acceptable, commercially-standard Service Level credits. Further, the Parties agree that if AMD receives service level credits from a third party outsourcer regarding Services AMD provides Spansion under this Agreement, AMD will apportion any service level credits it receives to Spansion in a manner proportionate to Spansion's cost allocation by AMD for the affected Service, and any
Service Level Credits.
 
such credit will offset the next payment obligation of Spansion (to the extent of the credit) which follows AMD's accrual of such credit. AMD will promptly notify Spansion of any such credits.

(a) The Services shall be provided to Spansion from (i) the Spansion Service Locations and (ii) the AMD Service Locations as established on the Effective Date or subsequently changed in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event AMD desires to establish or move Services to a Spansion Service Location, such action must go through the Change Order Procedure or be approved in writing by the Spansion Services Manager.
 
(b) Except as provided in Section 10 and unless otherwise agreed by Spansion, any incremental expenses incurred by Spansion or AMD and any costs incurred in connection with the performance or use of the Services, in each case as a result of AMD's relocation to, or use of, any different Service Locations at AMD's request, shall be paid by AMD or reimbursed to Spansion by AMD. Any incremental expenses incurred by Spansion or AMD as a result of a relocation to, or use of, any different Service Locations at Spansion's request or direction shall be paid by Spansion or reimbursed to AMD by Spansion.
 
7.2
Spansion Resources.
 
(a) At its own expense and in accordance with the Change Control Procedures, Spansion may replace and upgrade the Spansion Systems from time to time in Spansion's business judgment; provided that in replacing and upgrading such Spansion Systems, Spansion will comply with Section 4.2 and will not otherwise adversely impact AMD's ability to provide the Services in accordance with the Service Levels. AMD will promptly notify Spansion if any Spansion implementation of a new Spansion System, or any Spansion failure to replace or upgrade existing Spansion Systems will cause, or has caused, a problem or delay for AMD in providing the Services. AMD will be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by the Spansion System upgrade, or the Spansion failure to replace or upgrade Spansion Systems as notified by AMD. AMD shall work with Spansion to mitigate the effects of such degradation.
Spansion Systems.
 
(b)
Spansion Facilities.
 
(i) For so long as AMD requires the same for the performance of the Services, subject to Spansion's agreement (not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld), Spansion shall provide to AMD at no charge access to and the use of the space in the Spansion Service Locations, together with personal computers, workstations, terminals, printers, and other equipment utilized by Spansion, office furnishings, telephone equipment, janitorial services, utilities, and other reasonable resources, in connection with AMD's performance of the Services. Use of Spansion Service Locations by AMD does not constitute a leasehold interest in favor of AMD, and AMD shall not have exclusive access or control of the space provided to AMD under this Agreement.
 
(ii) AMD and AMD Agents shall not commit or permit waste or damage to such facilities, nor use such facilities for any unlawful purpose or act, and shall comply with all of Spansion's general and site-specific policies and procedures generally applicable to the applicable Spansion Service Location (as in effect from time to time and of which Spansion has provided notice to AMD), including procedures for the physical security of the Spansion Service Locations.
 
(iii) AMD shall permit Spansion and Spansion Agents to enter into those portions of the Spansion Service Locations occupied by AMD's staff at any time to perform facilities-related services. Spansion shall ensure that Spansion and Spansion Agents shall not interfere with AMD's performance of Services while exercising access rights under this Agreement, and AMD shall not be liable under this Agreement for its non-performance or its failure to meet the applicable Service Levels to the extent such non-performance or failure is caused by interference by Spansion or Spansion Agents.
 
7.3 While at the Spansion Service Locations, AMD and AMD Agents shall (a) comply with the requests, standard rules and regulations of Spansion regarding safety and health, personal and professional conduct (including adhering to general safety practices or procedures) generally applicable to such Spansion Service Locations, as notified to AMD from time to time and (b) otherwise conduct themselves in a businesslike manner. If Spansion notifies AMD that a particular member of the AMD Personnel is not conducting himself or herself in accordance with this Section, AMD shall promptly (y) investigate the matter and take appropriate action which may include (i) removing the applicable personnel from the AMD Personnel and providing Spansion with prompt notice of such removal and (ii) replacing the applicable personnel with a similarly qualified individual, or (z) take other appropriate disciplinary action to prevent a recurrence. In the event of multiple violations of this Section 7.3 by a particular member of the AMD Personnel, AMD shall promptly remove the individual from the AMD Personnel.
Conduct of AMD Personnel.
 
7.4
Safety and Security Procedures.
 
(a) AMD agrees to comply with Spansion's physical safety and security procedures for all Services it provides at Spansion Service Locations.
 
(b) AMD will promptly notify Spansion if any Spansion failure to maintain and enforce (except for enforcement with respect to AMD Personnel) physical safety and security procedures at Spansion Service Locations will cause, or has caused, a material problem or delay for AMD in providing the Services. AMD will be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by the Spansion failure to maintain and enforce (except for enforcement with respect to AMD Personnel) physical safety and security procedures at Spansion Service Locations; provided that AMD continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such failure and works with Spansion to resolve the failure and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of AMD's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable.
 
7.5
Data Security.
 
(a) AMD shall establish and maintain for Spansion environmental, security, and other safeguards against the destruction, loss or alteration of Spansion Data in the possession of AMD and during the electronic transmission, storage, and shipping thereof (the "") that (i) with respect to the Spansion Service Locations shall be consistent with (A) AMD's data security policies and procedures adopted for AMD in effect as of the Amendment Date or any updated policies and procedures as AMD may subsequently adopt, and (B) the safeguards required to meet any higher standard otherwise agreed by the Parties; and (ii) with respect to the AMD Service Locations shall be no less rigorous than (A) the data security policies and procedures in effect as of the Amendment Date at any of the AMD Service Locations or any updated policies and procedures as AMD may subsequently adopt, and (B) the safeguards required to meet any higher standard otherwise agreed upon by the Parties.
Data Safeguards
 
(b) AMD will monitor the activities of third parties who are party to Spansion Third Party Contracts and will enforce the provisions of such Spansion Third Party Contracts as they relate to Data Safeguards and resolve any disputes related thereto.
 
(c) In the event AMD or AMD Agents discover or are notified of a breach or potential breach of security relating to Spansion Data (whether by AMD or third parties), AMD shall immediately (i) notify the Spansion Services Manager of such breach or potential breach and (ii) if the applicable Spansion Data was in the possession of AMD or AMD Agents at the time of such breach or potential breach, AMD shall investigate and remediate the effects of the breach or potential breach. As a part of AMD's remediation efforts, if AMD reasonably believes that recurrences of the breach of security could be prevented by a Change, AMD may propose the Change.
 
 
8.1 AMD will maintain a mutually-accepted disaster recovery plan ("") having the charactersistics (including targeted time periods) set forth in Exhibit 8.1. Without limiting AMD's other obligations under this Agreement, including the Service Levels, in the event of an interruption in Services, AMD shall use reasonable efforts to reinstate the Services as promptly as possible.
Disaster Recovery Plan.
DRP
 
8.2 If and to the extent that a Party's performance of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (but specifically excluding labor and union-related activities) (each, a ""), and such non-performance, hindrance or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions, then the non-performing, hindered or delayed Party shall be excused for such non-performance, hindrance or delay, as applicable, of those obligations affected by the Force Majeure Event for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues and such Party continues to use reasonable efforts to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay, including through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means. The Party whose performance is prevented, hindered or delayed by a Force Majeure Event shall immediately notify the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and describe in
Force Majeure.
Force Majeure Event
 
reasonable detail the nature of the Force Majeure Event. The occurrence of a Force Majeure Event does not excuse, limit or otherwise affect AMD's obligation to provide either normal recovery procedures or any other disaster recovery services described in Section 8.1, except to the extent AMD is prevented, hindered or delayed from such performance by a Force Majeure Event and AMD continues to use reasonable efforts to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay. If a Service cannot be resumed as a result of a Force Majeure Event for a period of time sufficient to materially hinder Spansion's ability to continue to operate, but in no event less than thirty (30) days, Spansion may obtain such needed Services from a third party; provided however, that if AMD is thereafter able to resume providing such Service, Spansion will again retain AMD to provide such Service in accordance with this Agreement.
 
 
9.1 If the Parties agree that AMD should be assigned any agreement with a third party service provider or supplier (an ""), the Parties will list such Assigned Agreement in Exhibit 9.1. As of the Amendment Date, there will be no Assigned Agreements for purposes of this Agreement. AMD shall assume all responsibility (including all obligations and post-assignment liability) for the Assigned Agreements. AMD may, to the extent permitted by the Assigned Agreements, renew, modify, terminate or cancel, or request or grant any consents or waivers under, any such Assigned Agreements, provided any such modification, renewal, termination or cancellation does not in any way cause a material degradation of any of the Services or materially increase the charges to Spansion under this Agreement except pursuant to the Change Control Procedures or the Annual Budget Process. AMD shall ensure that it has the right to assign the Assigned Agreements back to Spansion upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
Assigned Agreements.
Assigned Agreement
 
9.2 Following assignment to AMD, AMD shall (a) receive all Assigned Agreement invoices, (b) review and correct any errors in any such Assigned Agreement invoices after receipt thereof, and (c) pay such Assigned Agreement invoices including any late fees accruing for fees owed after the effective date of assignment in respect of such Assigned Agreement invoices.
Assigned Agreement Invoices.
 
9.3 Exhibit 9.3 will list any Spansion agreements with third party service providers that the Parties agree that AMD will manage on Spansion's behalf (the ""). As of the Amendment Date, there will be no Managed Agreements for purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting Spansion's rights under the Managed Agreements, Spansion hereby appoints AMD as its representative for matters relating to the management, administration, and maintenance of the Managed Agreements to the extent necessary for AMD to perform its obligations under this Agreement. AMD shall assist Spansion in notifying all appropriate third parties of AMD's role with respect to the Managed Agreements. AMD shall manage, administer, and maintain the Managed Agreements in accordance with this Section 9.3, and shall manage such agreements in a way that does not result in any material degradation of the Services unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. AMD shall provide Spansion with reasonable notice of any renewal, termination or cancellation dates and fees with respect to the Managed Agreements. AMD shall not renew, modify, terminate, or cancel, or request or
Managed Agreements.
Managed Agreements
 
grant any consents or waivers under, any Managed Agreements without the consent of the Spansion Services Manager. Other Spansion agreements may be managed by AMD and become Managed Agreements governed by this Section 9.3 upon the mutual agreement of the Parties. Spansion shall provide AMD with complete copies of all Managed Agreements, including any modifications to such agreements as required for AMD to manage such agreements.
 
9.4 Subject to Section 9.3, AMD shall (a) receive all Managed Agreement Invoices, (b) review and correct any errors in any such Managed Agreement Invoices in a timely manner after receipt thereof, (c) pay such Managed Agreement Invoices, and (d) pay any late fees in respect of such Managed Agreement Invoices; provided that, with respect to invoices to be delivered by Spansion, AMD receives such invoices in a timely manner.
Managed Agreement Invoices.
 
9.5 AMD shall promptly notify Spansion of any breach of, or misuse or fraud in connection with, any Managed Agreements of which AMD becomes aware or should be aware assuming a reasonable inquiry, and shall cooperate with Spansion to prevent or stay any such breach, misuse or fraud. AMD shall monitor the activities of third parties who are party to Spansion Third Party Contracts and will enforce the provisions of such Spansion Third Party Contracts and resolve any disputes under such contracts.
Performance Under Agreements.
 
9.6 If a third-party vendor's acts or omissions under a Spansion Third Party Contract (a "") prevents, hinders, or delays AMD's performance of its obligations under this Agreement, AMD will promptly notify Spansion. AMD shall be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by a Vendor Action, provided that AMD continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such Vendor Action and works with Spansion to resolve the problem and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of AMD's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable, and unless AMD materially failed to perform its management obligations with respect to such vendor related to the Vendor Action. If AMD obtains damages or other remedies from a vendor in connection with the Vendor Action, AMD will pass on the amount of such damages or remedies to Spansion.
Vendor Actions.
Vendor Action
 
9.7 AMD, at its own expense, shall obtain, maintain, and comply with all of the AMD Consents. AMD shall also comply with the Spansion Consents. Spansion shall obtain, maintain, and comply with all of the Spansion Consents; provided, however, that AMD shall, as part of the Services, (a) perform the administrative tasks and functions required in connection with obtaining the Spansion Consents (e.g., managing the list of third parties from which Spansion Consents are required from information provided by Spansion, preparing letters for execution by Spansion and sending letters executed by Spansion to such third parties, managing communications with such third parties, and preparing the forms of Spansion Consents for signature); and (b) after such Spansion Consents are obtained, maintain the Spansion Consents. In addition, AMD shall also bear and pay the third party costs of obtaining such Spansion Consents (e.g., the fees the third party may charge for granting the Spansion Consent). The Parties shall cooperate in the negotiations of the Spansion Consents. Except as set forth on Exhibit 9.7, there are no Spansion Consents required to permit AMD to provide the Services as
Consents.
 
of the Effective Date. Any Spansion Consents obtained by AMD pursuant to this Section 9.7 shall be prepared in a manner that permits re-assignment to Spansion of the underlying consent, permission, agreement, or license, as the case may be upon any termination or the expiration of this Agreement.
 
 
10.1
Fees.
 
(a) In consideration of AMD providing the Services, Spansion shall pay to AMD the Fees in accordance with the budget allocations and amounts listed on Exhibit 10 and in accordance with Section 10.3. The Fees are subject to change annually in accordance with the Annual Budget Process, as well as in accordance with the Change Control Procedures and the quarterly budget reconciliation process described in Section 10.9.
 
(b) As of the Amendment Date, the Parties acknowledge that there are no Assigned Agreements or Managed Agreements and accordingly Spansion shall not be charged any Managed Agreement Fees and the Assigned Agreement Fees. In the event that either Party identifies agreements that are proposed to become either Assigned Agreements or Managed Agreements, it shall notify the other Party in advance of each such agreement, including information regarding the nature of each agreement and any proposed Managed Agreement Fees or Assigned Agreement Fees. Any transfer or subcontracting of Assigned Agreements or Managed Agreements is subject to the Annual Budget Process. The Managed Agreement Fees and Assigned Agreement Fees actually charged to Spansion shall reflect the application of any discounts, including discounts for prompt or early payment.
 
10.2 Subject to the Change Control Procedures, Spansion shall pay AMD any Special Project Fees agreed upon by the Parties in writing. As of the Effective Date, there are no approved Special Projects Fees.
Special Projects Fees.
 
10.3 Exhibit 10.3 sets forth all Pass-Through Expenses payable by Spansion in conjunction with receipt and use of the Services. Any Pass-Through Expenses not identified in Exhibit 10.3 as of the Amendment Date must be approved through the Change Control Procedures, the quarterly reconciliation process or the Annual Budget Process. AMD shall pay all Pass-Through Expenses directly to the applicable suppliers and shall invoice Spansion for amounts paid to such suppliers.
Pass-Through Expenses.
 
10.4 After the beginning of each month of the Term, AMD shall invoice Spansion for (a) all Fees; (b) all Managed Agreement Fees and Assigned Agreement Fees, if any; (c) Special Project Fees, if any, payable for services performed during the previous month, including, in the case of clause (c) any Reimbursable Expenses incurred by AMD in performing such Special Project and reimbursable pursuant to Section 10.10; and (d) all Pass-Through Expenses paid during the previous month. Each monthly invoice shall separately identify any Pass-Through Expenses incurred by AMD for the period covered by such invoice.
Invoicing.
 
10.5 AMD's invoices for Fees and Pass-Through Expenses shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after the end of the month in which the Services
Time of Payment.
 
were provided or the expenses incurred. Any other sum due AMD pursuant to this Agreement shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after receipt by Spansion of an invoice from AMD. All payments will be made via wire transfer or other mutually-acceptable means.
 
10.6 Within thirty (30) days after Spansion's receipt of each invoice, Spansion shall give notice to AMD of any amount shown in such invoice that Spansion disputes in good faith, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of the disputed amount and the grounds for the dispute.
Fee Dispute.
 
10.7 AMD will calculate Fees and costs charged to Spansion using a cost allocation methodology that accurately and fairly reflects AMD's reasonable, good faith forecasts of its actual costs associated with providing the Services and with a reasonable allocation to Spansion based on the provision of Services to Spansion and the costs therefore as a proportion of total services and costs AMD provides for itself, for Spansion and for any other division or Affiliate of AMD. AMD agrees that the target of the Fees and costs charged to Spansion will be AMD's actual costs in performing the Services. AMD shall set the Fees each year as part of the Annual Budget Process at such reasonable, good faith projection of actual costs (and any overhead costs allocated according to the principle set forth in the first sentence of this Section) plus five percent (5%) of such costs. Spansion acknowledges, however, that due to events that occur in between the quarterly reconciliations described in Section 10.9, the Fees may not accurately reflect AMD's actual costs. In such event and to such extent, AMD will not be deemed in breach of its obligation to charge Fees based on its reasonable, good faith estimates of actual costs, provided AMD uses diligent and good faith efforts to establish its actual costs as the basis for reconciling Fees under Section 10.9 and developing future budgets pursuant to the Annual Budget Process. The Parties agree that the cost allocation methodologies set forth in Exhibit 10.7 for each of the three major Spansion IT systems (Infrastructure, Business Systems and Manufacturing Systems) are reasonable methodologies for purposes of the foregoing. The Fees will be analyzed and updated pursuant to Section 10.9 and the Annual Budget Process.
Cost Allocation.
 
10.8 Each year, in accordance with Spansion's normal budget process, AMD shall meet with Spansion and assist Spansion as requested in developing an overall information technology budget, including expenditures for Special Projects and expenses that are to be paid directly by Spansion to third parties. Each such annual meeting will also address changes to the Services, the Service Levels and the applicable Fees for the succeeding year and the Parties will agree in writing upon the Services, Service Levels and Fees for the succeeding year. In addition, each year AMD will notify Spansion of the Spansion T&M Rates for the next year. The Fujitsu Services Advisor may advise Spansion regarding all such matters in the Fujitsu Services Advisor's reasonable judgment.
Annual Budget Process.
 
10.9 In addition to adjustments that may be discussed pursuant to the Annual Budget Process, the Fees shall be adjusted on a prospective basis by mutual written agreement on a quarterly basis (excluding the quarter when the Annual Budget Process will take the place of the quarterly reconciliation process) if a major event has occurred during the quarter that will substantially increase or decrease the actual costs of the Services in the future versus the then-current mutually-agreed budget (e.g., AMD realizes substantial cost savings as the result of an outsourcing transaction). As part of this quarterly
Price Protection; Quarterly Budget Reconciliation.
 
reconciliation process, adjustments to budgeted Fees and Pass-Through Expenses, whether resulting in an increase or decrease in Fees and Pass-Through Expenses, will be mutually agreed upon by AMD and Spansion and will apply prospectively only.
 
10.10 Spansion shall pay or reimburse AMD for its Reimbursable Expenses incurred in connection with its performance of Special Projects under Section 5 as may be agreed on a project by project basis. Except as provided in the previous sentence or on Exhibit 10 or Exhibit 10.3, AMD shall not charge Spansion for any Reimbursable Expenses incurred by AMD in providing the Services.
Expenses.
 
10.11 All periodic Fees under this Agreement are to be computed on a fiscal month basis and shall be prorated on a per diem basis for any partial month.
Proration.
 
10.12 Spansion shall be entitled to appoint an auditor reasonably acceptable to AMD to audit the security standards and disaster recovery methods used by AMD herein solely as they apply to protection of Spansion Data, whether the Fees and Services have been allocated to Spansion as required by Section 4.1, the cost allocation methodologies used by AMD to calculate the Fees, the allocation of Fees and Pass Through Expenses, and to otherwise verify the accuracy of the Fees and expenses that AMD charges Spansion for provision of Services and Systems under this Agreement. Spansion may conduct one such audit annually upon reasonable advance written notice to AMD delivered through the AMD Services Advisor. AMD agrees to provide such auditor with access to all data, records, reports, resources, facilities and personnel necessary to enable the auditor to conduct appropriate audits of the issues set forth above. The auditor shall promptly report any discrepancies in writing to Spansion, with a copy to the AMD Services Advisor and the Fujitsu Services Advisor. Any copies provided to the Fujitsu Services Advisor shall only include the results of the auditor's analysis and shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Spansion. Any discrepancy discovered shall be promptly rectified as part of the next quarter's budget reconciliation process, whether such discrepancy resulted in an overpayment or underpayment of Fees. All such audits shall be at Spansion's expense. AMD agrees to retain all pertinent records to justify its allocation of Fees and costs to Spansion for a period of two (2) years after provision of the applicable Service. In addition, in the event AMD conducts an audit (either by itself or through an independent auditor) of a third party providing any Services (or any part thereof), AMD shall make all such audit results available to Spansion promptly upon AMD's receipt thereof (and shall pass on to Spansion any adjustment pursuant to the budget reconciliation process).
Audits.
 
 
11.1 Except as specifically set forth in this Section 11, the Fees paid to AMD are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, gross receipts, excise, value-added, personal property, services or other Taxes (other than withholding taxes) ("") attributable to periods on or after the Effective Date. In the event that Spansion is prohibited by law from making any payment of Fees unless withholding taxes are deducted or withheld therefrom, then Spansion shall deduct such amounts as are necessary and pay the net amount to AMD after such deduction or withholding. Spansion shall promptly furnish AMD with a copy of an official tax receipt or other appropriate evidence of any withholding taxes imposed on
General.
Transaction Taxes
 
payments made under this Agreement. As part of this Agreement, Spansion shall issue AMD such valid tax exemption certificate(s) for the various state and local taxing authorities as Spansion may legally issue and AMD may legally and reasonably request to cover Transaction Taxes legally imposed upon the transactions arising out of this Agreement. In the event that a Transaction Tax is assessed against AMD on the provision of the Services by AMD to Spansion or on the Fees, however levied or assessed, Spansion shall reimburse AMD for or provide acceptable proof that Spansion has paid said amounts directly to the appropriate taxing authority. Spansion shall accrue and pay the appropriate amount of Taxes due to any state or local taxing authority for Transaction Taxes. Spansion will be responsible for the proper reporting of Transaction Taxes to the taxing authorities, and any charges associated with such filings, including but not limited to, interest or penalties due to the taxing authorities. AMD and Spansion agree to mutually cooperate in a reasonable manner for the purpose of minimizing all Transaction Taxes that are to be paid directly or indirectly by Spansion. AMD grants Spansion the right to pursue a separate action against any governmental unit which asserts Transaction Taxes and AMD agrees to cooperate in a reasonable manner with Spansion if such action is taken.
 
11.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the Parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, each Party shall be permitted to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby (and any related transactions or arrangements). This permission to disclose includes the ability of each Party to consult, without limitation of any kind, any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby (and any related transactions or arrangements). This provision is intended to comply with Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. Each Party acknowledges that this written authorization does not constitute a waiver by any Party of any privilege held by such Party pursuant to the attorney-client privilege or the confidentiality privilege of Code Section 7525(a).
Confidentiality; Disclosure to Taxing Authorities.
 
11.3 Spansion and AMD shall each bear sole responsibility for franchise and privilege taxes on its business, taxes based on its net income, and employment taxes with respect to its employees.
Other Taxes.
 
11.4 Spansion shall bear sole responsibility for all sales, use, gross receipts, excise, value-added or personal property taxes attributable to New Equipment and any third party maintenance thereon procured by AMD on behalf of Spansion (with the consent of Spansion in connection with the Change Order Procedures) in connection with AMD's performance of Services under this Agreement (provided Spansion obtains unencumbered title to such equipment). With respect to any Software to be delivered to Spansion within the State of California, for so long as there is a tax benefit to Spansion in the delivery methods hereinafter described, AMD shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third party vendor to, deliver any Software by means that minimize the tax attributable to the delivery of such Software to Spansion.
New Equipment.
 
11.5 Spansion and AMD shall cooperate to segregate the Fees into the following separate payment categories: (a) those for taxable Services; and (b) those for nontaxable Services.
Cooperation.
 
11.6 For any Taxes that AMD is entitled to collect from Spansion hereunder for remittance to the applicable Governmental Authority, AMD shall separately state the amount of such Taxes on its invoice. If AMD fails to timely comply with the foregoing obligation, AMD shall be responsible for any resulting noncompliance with Law.
Invoices.
 
 
12.1 The terms, conditions and license rights regarding AMD's Licensed Parent Software used in the provision or receipt of Services hereunder shall be governed by the Intellectual Property Contribution and Ancillary Matters Agreement.
In General
.
 
12.2 The license of Other Software will be agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to the Change Control Procedures, as a Special Project, or as part of the Annual Budget Process. At such time, the Parties will agree whether the Other Software will be licensed by AMD and sublicensed to Spansion, or whether Spansion will obtain the license to the Other Software directly with sufficient rights for AMD to use the Other Software on Spansion's behalf. If licensed by AMD, Spansion will bear any associated license and maintenance fees as either a Pass-Through Expense or as part of the Fees, except to the extent already included as a Fee or Pass-Through Expense, in which case AMD shall itself bear such expense and not charge Spansion therefor. In the event Spansion must pay license fees for Other Software directly, and such fees are included in the Fees or Pass-Through Expenses, AMD shall reimburse Spansion for such amount, due within ninety (90) days of Spansion's notification to AMD thereof.
Other Software.
 
12.3 All Developed Software and Work Product created pursuant to AMD's performance of Special Projects shall be owned by AMD unless expressly agreed in advance to the contrary. If any ownership of Developed Software or Work Product is assigned to Spansion, such assignment will be subject to AMD's right in its Background Technology and to a grant-back license to AMD.
Developed Software and Work Product.
 
 
13.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that all proprietary or nonpublic information disclosed by one Party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving Party") in connection with this Agreement, directly or indirectly, which information is (a) marked as "proprietary" or "confidential" or, if disclosed orally, is designated as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure and reduced in writing or other tangible (including electronic) form that includes a prominent confidentiality notice and delivered to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days of disclosure, or (b) provided under circumstances reasonably indicating that it constitutes confidential and proprietary information, constitutes the confidential and proprietary information of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information").

Without limiting the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall use at least the same procedures and degree of care which it uses to protect its own confidential information of like importance, and in no event less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party shall be fully responsible for compliance by its employees with the foregoing, and any act or omission of an employee of the Receiving Party shall constitute an act or omission of the Receiving Party. The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 13.1 shall apply and continue, with regard to all Confidential Information disclosed hereunder, during the Term and for a period of ten (10) years from the date of termination of this Agreement.
 
13.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information will not include information that: (a) was already known by the Receiving Party, other than under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any third party, at the time of disclosure hereunder, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's tangible (including written or electronic) records in existence at such time; (b) was generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party hereunder; (c) became generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after its disclosure other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement; (d) was subsequently lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by an Entity or person other than the Disclosing Party not subject to any duty of confidentiality with respect thereto; or (e) was developed by the Receiving Party without reference to any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's tangible (including written or electronic) records in existence at such time.

The Fees will be adjusted accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Service at issue is an Enterprise Service, then Spansion may not terminate such Service for a period of ninety (90) days without adequate cure following initial notice of material breach.

(b) For so long as Fujitsu maintains at least a ten percent (10%) Aggregate Ownership Interest, AMD and Spansion may not amend this Agreement without the prior written consent of Fujitsu (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld), to the extent an amendment (i) reduces the rights of the Fujitsu Services Advisor set forth herein, (ii) reduces Fujitsu's right to consent to amendments set forth in this Section, (iii) establishes a basis for charging Spansion for the Services other than by calculating AMD's reasonable, good faith estimates of actual costs plus five percent (5%), as set forth in Section 8.6, or materially alters the cost allocation methodologies described in Section 8.6, (iv) eliminates or reduces AMD's obligation to provide Services at a level consistent with the level of similar services AMD provides to its other divisions or Affiliates or (v) materially reduces Spansion's rights under this Agreement (e.g., eliminates the requirement that all Changes require Spansion's consent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes to Fees or Services resulting from Change Control Procedures, the Annual Budget Process or the Fee reconciliation process described in Section 8.6 shall not be deemed to constitute amendments to this Agreement.
 
3.8 Spansion shall reasonably cooperate with AMD by making available, as requested by AMD, management decisions, information, approvals or disapprovals, and acceptances or rejections in a reasonably timely manner so that AMD may fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.
Approvals.
 
3.9 The Parties shall use the following procedures (the "") to implement Changes.
Change Control Procedures.
Change Control Procedures
 
(a)
General.
 
(i) Changes shall be implemented only by mutual agreement of the Parties through these Change Control Procedures, except as may be necessary on an emergency, temporary basis to maintain the continuity of the Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the implementation of a Change does not necessarily require an increase in the Fees or other fees payable by Spansion or a reduction in the scope of Services or in Service Levels provided hereunder, and that any change in the Fees or other amounts payable by Spansion as a result of a Change will be an adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 8. All decisions regarding Changes are subject to the approval by the Board of
Changes.
 
Directors, which may delegate its decision-making authority to Spansion management as it deems appropriate. The Parties acknowledge and agree that not all modifications to the Services may constitute Changes; as part of the routine operation of Spansion and AMD, modifications that are not material or significant, as determined by AMD in its reasonable judgment, may be conducted without recourse to the Change Control Procedures; provided that the Spansion Services Manager is notified  on a regular basis consistent with AMD's internal processes  of the modifications being implemented on Spansion's behalf, with a copy of such report provided to the Fujitsu Services Advisor.
 
(ii) Unless otherwise agreed by Spansion, with respect to all Changes, AMD shall (a) schedule Changes so as not to unreasonably interrupt Spansion's business operations, other than those Changes made on a emergency basis to maintain the continuity of the Services, (b) prepare and deliver to Spansion each quarter a rolling schedule for ongoing and planned agreed upon Changes for the next quarter, and (c) monitor the status of Changes against the applicable schedule.
Schedule.
 
(iii) The AMD Services Advisor and the Spansion Services Manager shall meet on a mutually agreed schedule (no less frequently than each quarter) for the purpose of reviewing Change requests submitted by either Party in accordance with these Change Control Procedures. The Spansion Services Manager will provide the Fujitsu Services Advisor written or telephonic notice of these meetings and the Fujitsu Services Advisor may attend.
Meetings.
 
(b) Requests for Changes shall be submitted for review in accordance with the Change Control Procedures, and shall include a reasonably detailed description of the requested Change together with the basis for such Change. All requests for Changes by Spansion shall be communicated to AMD through the Spansion Services Manager or his or her authorized designee.
Requests for Changes.
 
(i) Within ten (10) business days after AMD receives a request from Spansion for a Change, either AMD or a joint project team working on the Service to be impacted, as appropriate, shall prepare and provide to Spansion an initial written proposal for the Change (a ""), which proposal will include AMD's initial proposals regarding (A) the Services and the applicable schedule for performing the Services, including but not limited to Spansion's related obligations, to effect the Change, (B) the resources required to perform Services effecting the Change and resulting from the Change, (C) the Fees for Services, and (D) any additional areas that are reasonably likely to be impacted by the proposed Change. The Change Proposal shall also contain a description of any other anticipated costs that Spansion will incur as a result of the Change that it would otherwise not have incurred. Within ten (10) business days after receiving such Change Proposal, Spansion shall either approve the Change Proposal, notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further, or withdraw the request for such Change. Spansion's failure to approve the Change Proposal or notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further within this ten (10) business day period shall be deemed a rejection of the Change Proposal, and the Change shall not be implemented.
Changes Initiated by Spansion.
Change Proposal
 
(ii) Concurrent with the submission of a request for a Change by AMD, either AMD or a joint project team working on the impacted Service, as appropriate, shall provide to Spansion a Change Proposal containing the information specified in subparagraph (i) above. Within ten (10) business days after receiving such proposal, Spansion shall either approve the Change Proposal, notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further, or reject the requested Change. Spansion's failure to approve the Change Proposal or notify AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the Change Proposal further within this ten (10) business day period shall be deemed a rejection of such request, and the Change shall not be implemented.
Changes Initiated by AMD.
 
(c) If within ten (10) business days after receipt of a Change Proposal, Spansion notifies AMD that Spansion desires to discuss the proposed Change further, the Spansion Services Manager and AMD Services Advisor will promptly consider the Change Proposal in person or by telephone and will attempt in good faith to develop a mutually acceptable Change Proposal. The Spansion Services Manager will notify the Fujitsu Services Advisor of the proposed meeting and the Fujitsu Services Advisor may attend any such meeting.
Further Discussion of Changes.
 
(d) All Changes are subject to the written approval of the Parties. Only following receipt of each Party's written approval may AMD begin to implement the approved Change, and any Change so approved by each Party that affects any Statement of Work shall be deemed to be an amendment to such Statement of Work.
Implementation of Changes.
 
(e) If a Service Level failure, reasonable safety concern, Governmental Authority or change in Law, requires an immediate Change to a Service, then AMD may implement such Change immediately upon notice to Spansion, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor. Any change in Fees or equipment or technology purchases for which AMD seeks reimbursement from Spansion, or any long-term, material degradation in Service Levels resulting from such Change, unless such degradation is unavoidably required in the circumstances (in which event AMD shall use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such degradation), shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures.
Emergency Changes.
 
(f) In the event the Parties determine that certain general and administrative services provided by AMD and/or its Affiliates to the AMD Flash Memory Business prior to Closing have not been included in a Statement of Work and are not being separately addressed within Spansion, AMD will offer such services to Spansion or its Affiliates on the terms set forth in this Agreement and Spansion shall have the option to accept or reject such additional services. In the event Spansion elects to accept such additional services, the Parties shall prepare and agree on a Statement of Work to reflect the provision of such services and the Statement of Work shall be appended to this Agreement.
Omitted Services.
 
3.10 Spansion may from time to time during the Term request that AMD perform Special Projects. Upon receipt of such a request from Spansion, AMD shall provide Spansion with a written proposal for such Special Project which shall include:
Special Projects.
 
(a) a description of the services, functions and responsibilities AMD anticipates performing in connection with such Special Project;
 
(b) a description of the obligations of Spansion, if any, required for AMD to perform such Special Project;
 
(c) a schedule for commencing and completing such Special Project;
 
(d) AMD's prospective fees for such Special Project, either on a fixed fee or time and materials basis; and
 
(e) when appropriate, a description of any new Software or equipment required in connection with such Special Project.
 
AMD shall not begin performing any Special Project until the Parties have agreed in writing upon the specifications, requirements, schedule and fees for such Special Project pursuant to the Change Control Procedures. Spansion shall have the right to contract with a third party to perform any Special Project, provided that the Special Project does not affect the provision of Services and would not result in the breach of an obligation that AMD may have with a third party. Spansion will notify AMD of any proposal that Spansion wants to make to a third party to perform a Special Project instead of having AMD perform that Special Project. If the Parties do not agree upon terms by which AMD will perform a Special Project, or if AMD objects to Spansion retaining a third party to perform the Special Project because AMD reasonably believes in good faith that such Special Project, or the third party's performance of that Special Project, will negatively affect the Services, either by reducing performance or functionality, or increasing the cost to AMD, or by causing AMD to breach an obligation to a third party, each Party shall have the right to escalate the issue to the Board of Directors, and the Parties shall in good faith negotiate a mutually-acceptable resolution to the matter. If Spansion does retain a third party to perform a Special Project hereunder, then AMD and Spansion will agree in writing upon any changes to the Services, Service Levels (if applicable), Fees that result from Spansion retaining the third party and commissioning the Special Project.
 
 
4.1 Pursuant to separate statements of work attached hereto and made a part hereof (""), AMD, either itself or through its Affiliates or subcontractors (subject to Section 4.5), shall perform the services, functions, and responsibilities for Spansion identified in the separate Statements of Work (the ""). The Statements of Work may be updated by the Parties from time to time upon mutual agreement pursuant to the Change Control Procedures or the annual review of the Spansion general administrative services budget and the Services described in Section 8.7 (the ""). AMD will provide Spansion the Services under terms (including those related to charges, cost allocation and service levels) that are at least as favorable as those it provides any other AMD business unit, division or AMD Affiliate receiving similar services from AMD (or an AMD subcontractor), subject to any deviations agreed to by the Parties to address Spansion's specific requirements as communicated to AMD and taking into account that this Agreement provides for a cost plus allocation budgeting structure that may not apply to other AMD business units, divisions or Affiliates. The Services (including any new Services added pursuant to mutual agreement by the Parties) will evolve and be supplemented, modified, enhanced or replaced, reduced or eliminated over time as agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to the Change Control

4.2 AMD shall obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for AMD to deliver the Services under this Agreement. Spansion shall obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for Spansion to use the Services under this Agreement. Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall provide to the requesting Party reasonable cooperation and assistance in obtaining Governmental Approvals hereunder.
Governmental Approvals.
 
4.3 If either Party becomes aware of any changes in Law that relate to AMD's delivery of the Services or Spansion's use of the Services, then such Party will notify the other Party of such changes in Law. With respect to any changes related to AMD's delivery of Services, AMD and Spansion shall work together pursuant to the Change Control Procedures to identify the impact of such changes on AMD's delivery of the Services, and any changes in the fees charged to Spansion, as a result and shall work together to implement any necessary modifications to the Services prior to the deadline imposed by the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction for such requirement or change. AMD will use reasonable efforts to minimize the incremental cost to Spansion of compliance with such Laws.
Changes in Law.
 
4.4 AMD shall comply with all Laws governing the provision of the Services and the performance of its obligations, including identifying and procuring permits, certificates, approvals and inspections required under such Laws. If a charge of non-compliance by AMD with any such Laws occurs, AMD shall promptly notify Spansion of such charge in writing and AMD shall promptly remedy such non-compliance in accordance with Law.
Compliance With Laws.
 
4.5 Spansion acknowledges that AMD may outsource to a third party or third parties the performance of some or all of the Services that AMD is obligated to provide under this Agreement; provided however, that in the event such outsourcing will lead to any Change in Service Levels or Fees, such outsourcing shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring AMD to perform directly any Services outside of the United States and to the extent that Services will be performed outside the United States, AMD may engage an Affiliate, subsidiary or subcontractor to perform such Services (subject to the Change Control Procedures in accordance with the foregoing). No subcontracting shall release AMD from its responsibility for its obligations under this Agreement. AMD shall be responsible for the work and activities of each of the AMD Agents, including compliance with the terms of this Agreement. AMD shall be responsible for all payments to its subcontractors unless the Parties agree that Spansion will pay directly to an AMD Affiliate providing Services to Spansion.
Subcontractors.
 
4.6 AMD will coordinate and cooperate in good faith with Spansion Agents hired by Spansion from time to time to the extent reasonably required by Spansion and with Fujitsu to the extent that Fujitsu supplies similar or complementary services to Spansion. AMD will promptly notify Spansion if a Fujitsu or any Spansion Agent act or omission will cause, or has caused, a problem or delay in providing the Services. AMD will be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its
Spansion Agents.
 
obligations was caused by the interference of a Spansion Agent or Fujitsu; provided such interference was not at the direction of AMD and provided that AMD continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such interference and works with Spansion to resolve the problem and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of AMD's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable.
 
4.7 On a semi-annual basis AMD shall provide a report to Spansion, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor, (a) identifying those at AMD principally responsible for providing Services in each Service area, (b) identifying any significant problems or issues encountered in delivering the Services for each of the Service areas, and (c) identifying any major changes in the amount of Services or Fees in the Service areas that are expected or planned by AMD for the upcoming two (2) quarters or year. The AMD Services Advisor will provide the Spansion Services Manager with such other reports regarding the performance of the Services and the Fees as the Spansion Services Manager shall reasonably require.
AMD Reporting.
 
4.8 Spansion may independently analyze AMD's compliance with the Service Levels and provide AMD feedback regarding AMD's performance. In addition, if as part of that benchmarking, Spansion in good faith determines that the pricing it is charged for the Services is not within a reasonable range, Spansion may notify AMD and the Parties will consider whether changes are appropriate to the Services to enable the Parties to enjoy better pricing. Any such benchmarking shall be subject to the confidentiality restriction set forth in Section 11.
Spansion Benchmarking.
 
4.9 Spansion may not remarket or sell all or any portion of the Services provided under this Agreement, or make all or any portion of the Services available to any party other than Spansion or Spansion's Affiliates, without AMD's consent.
Use of Services.
 
 
5.1 AMD shall perform the Services at a minimum in conformance with the level of service and with at least the same degree of accuracy, quality, completeness, timeliness, responsiveness and efficiency as was provided to the AMD Flash Memory Business prior to the Effective Date ("").

Dispute Escalation Process.
 
(a) . If the Spansion Services Manager determines that AMD has failed to perform the Services in accordance with the applicable Service Levels, the Spansion Services Manager may initiate contact with the AMD Services Advisor to discuss the deficiency, and if necessary may submit a Change Proposal regarding a corrective action plan in accordance with the Change Control Procedures. Upon such contact, the Spansion Services Manager and AMD Services Advisor will promptly consider the corrective action plan in person or by telephone and will attempt in good faith to agree to a mutually acceptable corrective action plan. The Spansion Services Manager will invite the Fujitsu Services Advisor to attend any such meetings. If the Parties cannot agree upon a corrective action plan within a fifteen (15) day business day period, the issue will be escalated in accordance with clause (b) below.
Initial Notice; Good Faith Discussion
 
(b) . If the issue is not resolved in accordance with clause (a) above, the Spansion Services Manager will notify the Spansion chief financial officer of the issue. If the Spansion chief financial officer reasonably determines that the issue warrants further escalation, the Spansion chief financial officer will then contact the person within AMD in charge of the provision of the Services at issue to discuss the issue in person or by telephone and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the issue for a period of ten (10) business days. If the issue is not resolved, as agreed by the Parties, within such ten (10) business day period, the issue will be escalated in accordance with clause (c) below.
Management Escalation
 
(c) . If the Spansion chief financial officer reasonably determines that AMD has failed to offer an acceptable remedy for the Service failure, then the Spansion chief financial officer shall notify the Board of Directors (a) indicating the nature and the basis of the issue, and (b) listing the measures that Spansion proposes to take against AMD in order to remedy the Service failure. The Board of Directors shall consider the measures proposed by the Spansion chief financial officer against AMD and shall provide its recommendation or approval for any measures Spansion shall take to remedy the Service failure.
Board Escalation
 
(d) . In the event that the unremediated Service failure has a material adverse impact on Spansion's business or operations, and subject to Board of Directors approval, Spansion may terminate the affected Service in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 14 (presuming the applicable cure period has elapsed as set forth therein) and shall have the right to contract with a third party to perform such Service.
Termination
 
(e) . In the event that the Board of Directors approves Spansion's proposed measures, and AMD believes that such measures are inappropriate, AMD shall have the right to institute dispute resolution proceedings in accordance with Section 13.
Right to Arbitrate
 
 
6.1
Service Locations.
 
(a) The Services shall be provided to Spansion from the Spansion Service Locations and the AMD Service Locations established on the Effective Date or subsequently changed in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event AMD desires to establish or move Services to a Spansion Service Location, such action shall either be approved through the Change Control Procedures or be approved in writing by the Spansion Services Manager.
 
(b) Except as provided in Section 8 and unless otherwise agreed by Spansion, any incremental expenses incurred by Spansion or AMD and any costs incurred in connection with the performance or use of the Services, in each case as a result of AMD's relocation to, or use of, any different Service Locations at AMD's request, shall be paid by AMD or reimbursed to Spansion by AMD. Any incremental expenses incurred by Spansion or AMD as a result of a relocation to, or use of, any different Service Locations at Spansion's request or direction shall be paid by Spansion or reimbursed to AMD by Spansion.
 
6.2
Spansion Resources and Facilities.
 
(a) For so long as AMD requires the same for the performance of the Services, subject to Spansion's agreement (not to be unreasonably withheld), Spansion shall provide to AMD at no charge access to and the use of the space in the Spansion Service Locations, together with personal computers, workstations, terminals, printers, and other equipment utilized by Spansion, office furnishings, telephone equipment, janitorial services, utilities and other reasonable resources in connection with AMD's performance of the Services. Use of Spansion Service Locations by AMD does not constitute a leasehold interest in favor of AMD, and AMD shall not have exclusive access or control of the space provided to AMD under this Agreement.
 
(b) AMD and AMD Agents shall not commit or permit waste or damage to such facilities, nor use such facilities for any unlawful purpose or act, and shall comply with all of Spansion's general and site-specific policies and procedures generally applicable to the applicable Spansion Service Location (as in effect from time to time and of which Spansion has provided notice to AMD), including procedures for the physical security of the Spansion Service Locations.
 
(c) AMD shall permit Spansion and Spansion Agents to enter into those portions of the Spansion Service Locations occupied by AMD's staff at any time to perform facilities-related services. Spansion shall ensure that Spansion and Spansion Agents shall not interfere with AMD's performance of Services while exercising access rights under this Agreement, and AMD shall not be liable under this Agreement for its non-performance or its failure to meet the applicable Service Levels to the extent such non-performance or failure is caused by interference by Spansion or Spansion Agents.
 
6.3 While at the Spansion Service Locations, AMD and AMD Agents shall (a) comply with the requests, standard rules and regulations of Spansion regarding safety and health, personal and professional conduct (including adhering to general safety practices or procedures) generally applicable to such Spansion Service Locations, as notified to AMD from time to time and (b) otherwise conduct themselves in a businesslike manner. If Spansion notifies AMD that a particular member of the AMD Personnel is not conducting himself or herself in accordance with this Section, AMD shall promptly (y) investigate the matter and take appropriate action which may include (i) removing the applicable personnel from the AMD Personnel and providing Spansion with prompt notice of such removal and (ii) replacing the applicable personnel with a similarly qualified individual, or (z) take other appropriate disciplinary action to prevent a recurrence. In the event of multiple violations of this Section 6.3 by a particular member of the AMD Personnel, AMD shall promptly remove the individual from the AMD Personnel.
Conduct of AMD Personnel.
 
6.4
Safety and Security Procedures.
 
(a) AMD agrees to comply with Spansion's physical safety and security procedures for all Services it provides at Spansion Service Locations.
 
(b) AMD will promptly notify Spansion if any Spansion failure to maintain and enforce (except for enforcement with respect to AMD Personnel) physical safety and security procedures at Spansion Service Locations will cause, or has caused, a material problem or delay for AMD in providing the Services. AMD will be excused from failure to meet a
 
Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by the Spansion failure to maintain and enforce (except for enforcement with respect to AMD Personnel) physical safety and security procedures at Spansion Service Locations; provided that AMD continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such failure and works with Spansion to resolve the failure and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of AMD's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable.
 
 
7.1 If and to the extent that a Party's performance of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (but specifically excluding labor and union-related activities) (each, a ""), and such non-performance, hindrance or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions, then the non-performing, hindered or delayed Party shall be excused for such non-performance, hindrance or delay, as applicable, of those obligations affected by the Force Majeure Event for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues and such Party continues to use reasonable efforts to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay, including through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means. The Party whose performance is prevented, hindered or delayed by a Force Majeure Event shall immediately notify the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Force Majeure Event. If a Service cannot be resumed as a result of a Force Majeure Event for a period of time sufficient to materially hinder Spansion's ability to continue to operate, but in no event less than thirty (30) days, Spansion may obtain such needed Services from a third party; provided however, that if AMD is thereafter able to resume providing such Service, Spansion will again retain AMD to provide such Service in accordance with this Agreement.
Force Majeure.
Force Majeure Event
 
 
8.1 In consideration of AMD providing the Services, Spansion shall pay to AMD the fees set forth in the Statements of Work, as such fees may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the ""). The Fees include AMD's reasonable, good faith estimates of pass through expenses for third party Software costs and other third party services (such portion of the Fees referred to herein as the ""). Pass-Through Expenses shall be billed at direct cost, without any mark-up. The Fees are subject to change annually in accordance with the Annual Budget Process, as well as in accordance with the Change Control Procedures and the quarterly budget reconciliation process described in Section 8.8. In the event through the Change Control Procedures or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement additional Pass-Through Expenses will be incurred, AMD will separately identify such additional Pass-Through Expenses in the applicable Statement of Work.
Fees.
Fees
Pass-Through Expenses
 
8.2 Subject to the Change Control Procedures, Spansion shall pay AMD any Special Project Fees agreed upon by the Parties in writing. As of the Amendment Date, there are no approved Special Projects Fees.
Special Project Fees.
 
8.3 After the beginning of each fiscal month of the Term, AMD shall invoice Spansion for (i) all Fees payable for Services performed during the previous fiscal month and all Pass-Through Expenses paid during the previous fiscal month, and (ii) all Special Project Fees, if any, payable for services performed during the previous fiscal month, including in the case of clause (ii) any Reimbursable Expenses incurred by AMD in performing a Special Project and reimbursable pursuant to Section 8.9.
Invoicing.
 
8.4 AMD's invoices shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after the end of the fiscal month in which the Services or, if applicable, agreed upon Special Project services, were provided or the costs incurred. Any other sum due AMD pursuant to this Agreement shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after receipt by Spansion of an invoice from AMD. All payments will be made via wire transfer or other mutually-acceptable means.
Time of Payment.
 
8.5 Within thirty (30) days after Spansion's receipt of each invoice, Spansion shall give notice to AMD of any amount shown in such invoice that Spansion disputes in good faith, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of the disputed amount and the grounds for the dispute.
Fee Dispute.
 
8.6 AMD will calculate Fees and costs charged to Spansion using a cost allocation methodology that accurately and fairly reflects AMD's reasonable, good faith forecasts of its actual costs associated with providing the Services and with a reasonable allocation to Spansion based on the provision of Services to Spansion and the costs therefor as a proportion of total services and costs AMD provides for itself, for Spansion and for any other division or Affiliate of AMD. AMD agrees that the target of the Fees and costs charged to Spansion will be AMD's actual costs in performing the Services. AMD shall set the Fees each year as part of the Annual Budget Process at such reasonable, good faith projection of actual costs (and any overhead costs allocated according to the principle set forth in the first sentence of this Section) plus five percent (5%) of AMD's costs, excluding Pass-Through Expenses.
Cost Allocation.
 
Spansion acknowledges, however, that due to events that occur in between the quarterly reconciliations described in Section 8.8, the Fees may not accurately reflect AMD's actual costs. In such event and to such extent, AMD will not be deemed in breach of its obligation to charge Fees based on its reasonable, good faith estimates of actual costs, provided AMD uses diligent and good faith efforts to establish its actual costs as the basis for reconciling Fees under Section 8.8 and developing future budgets pursuant to the Annual Budget Process. The Fees will be analyzed and updated pursuant to Section 8.8 and the Annual Budget Process.
 
8.7 Each year, in accordance with Spansion's normal budget process, AMD shall meet with Spansion and assist Spansion as requested in developing an overall general administrative services budget, including expenditures that are to be paid directly by Spansion to third parties. Each such annual meeting will also address changes to the Services and the applicable Fees for the succeeding fiscal year and the Parties will agree in writing upon the Services, Service Levels (as applicable) and Fees for the succeeding year. The Fujitsu Services Advisor may advise Spansion regarding all such matters in the Fujitsu Services Advisor's reasonable judgment.
Annual Budget Process.
 
8.8 In addition to adjustments that may be discussed pursuant to the Annual Budget Process, the Fees shall be adjusted on a prospective basis by mutual written agreement on a quarterly basis (excluding the quarter when the Annual Budget Process will take the place of the quarterly reconciliation process) if a major event has occurred during the quarter that will substantially increase or decrease the actual costs of the Services in the future versus the then-current mutually-agreed budget (e.g., AMD realizes substantial cost savings as the result of an outsourcing transaction). As part of this quarterly reconciliation process, adjustments to budgeted Fees (including Pass-Through Expenses), whether resulting in an increase or decrease in Fees (including Pass-Through Expenses), will be mutually agreed upon by AMD and Spansion and will apply prospectively only.
Price Protection; Quarterly Budget Reconciliation.
 
8.9 Spansion shall pay or reimburse AMD for its Reimbursable Expenses incurred in connection with its performance of Special Projects as may be agreed on a project by project basis. Except as provided in the previous sentence or as otherwise agreed through the Change Control Procedures, AMD shall not charge Spansion for any expenses or costs incurred by AMD in providing Special Project services.
Expenses.
 
8.10 All periodic Fees under this Agreement are to be computed on a fiscal month basis and shall be prorated on a per diem basis for any partial fiscal month.
Proration.
 
8.11 In the event Spansion in good faith believes there is a material difference between actual costs incurred by AMD and the Fees, Spansion shall be entitled to appoint an auditor reasonably acceptable to AMD to audit the cost allocation methodologies used by AMD to calculate the Fees, the allocation of Fees and Pass-Through Expenses, and to otherwise verify the accuracy of the Fees and expenses that AMD charges Spansion for provision of Services under this Agreement. Spansion may conduct one such audit annually upon reasonable advance written notice to AMD delivered through the AMD Services Advisor. AMD agrees to provide such auditor with access to all data, records, reports, resources, facilities and personnel necessary to enable the auditor to conduct appropriate audits of the Fees charged to Spansion. The auditor shall promptly report any discrepancies in writing to Spansion, with a copy to the AMD Services
Audits.
 
Advisor and the Fujitsu Services Advisor. Any copies provided the Fujitsu Services Advisor shall only include the results of the auditor's analysis and shall be deemed Confidential Information of Spansion. Any discrepancy discovered shall be promptly rectified as part of the next quarter's budget reconciliation process, whether such discrepancy resulted in an overpayment or underpayment of Fees. All such audits shall be at Spansion's expense. AMD agrees to retain all pertinent records to justify its allocation of Fees and costs to Spansion for a period of two (2) years after provision of the applicable Service. In addition, in the event AMD conducts an audit (either by itself or through an independent auditor) of a third party providing any Services (or any part thereof), AMD shall make all such audit results available to Spansion promptly upon AMD's receipt thereof (and shall pass on to Spansion any adjustment pursuant to the budget reconciliation process).
 
 
9.1 Except as specifically set forth in this Section 9, the Fees paid to AMD are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, gross receipts, excise, value-added, personal property, services or other Taxes (other than withholding taxes) ("") attributable to periods on or after the Effective Date. In the event that Spansion is prohibited by law from making any payment of Fees unless withholding taxes are deducted or withheld therefrom, then Spansion shall deduct such amounts as are necessary and pay the net amount to AMD after such deduction or withholding. Spansion shall promptly furnish AMD with a copy of an official tax receipt or other appropriate evidence of any withholding taxes imposed on payments made under this Agreement. As part of this Agreement, Spansion shall issue AMD such valid tax exemption certificate(s) for the various state and local taxing authorities as Spansion may legally issue and AMD may legally and reasonably request to cover Transaction Taxes legally imposed upon the transactions arising out of this Agreement. In the event that a Transaction Tax is assessed against AMD on the provision of the Services by AMD to Spansion or on the Fees, however levied or assessed, Spansion shall reimburse AMD for or provide acceptable proof that Spansion has paid said amounts directly to the appropriate taxing authority. Spansion shall accrue and pay the appropriate amount of Taxes due to any state or local taxing authority for Transaction Taxes . Spansion will be responsible for the proper reporting of Transaction Taxes to the taxing authorities, and any charges associated with such filings, including but not limited to, interest or penalties due to the taxing authorities. AMD and Spansion agree to mutually cooperate in a reasonable manner for the purpose of minimizing all Transaction Taxes that are to be paid directly or indirectly by Spansion. AMD grants Spansion the right to pursue a separate action against any governmental unit which asserts Transaction Taxes and AMD agrees to cooperate in a reasonable manner with Spansion if such action is taken.

shall be provided to all Board members simultaneously, with a copy also provided simultaneously to the AMD Services Manager and the Spansion Services Advisor. The Board of Directors shall consider the Fujitsu Service Advisor's concerns in good faith and may take any action it deems reasonable in the circumstances.
 
3.7
Contract Amendments.
 
(a) AMD and Spansion may only amend this Agreement upon the approval of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may delegate its decision-making authority to Spansion management as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that any Special Project or new Services purchase of greater than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) payable in any Spansion fiscal year will require specific approval from the Board of Directors.
 
(b) For so long as Fujitsu maintains at least a ten percent (10%) Aggregate Ownership Interest, Spansion and AMD may not amend this Agreement without the prior written consent of Fujitsu (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld), to the extent an amendment (i) reduces the rights of the Fujitsu Services Advisor set forth herein, (ii) reduces Fujitsu's right to consent to amendments set forth in this Section, (iii) establishes a basis for charging AMD for the Services other than by calculating Spansion's reasonable, good faith estimates of actual costs plus five percent (5%), as set forth in Section 8.6, or materially alters the cost allocation methodologies described in Section 8.6 or (iv) materially reduces Spansion's rights under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes to Fees or Services resulting from Change Control Procedures, the Annual Budget Process or the Fee reconciliation process described in Section 8.6 shall not be deemed to constitute amendments to this Agreement.
 
3.8 AMD shall reasonably cooperate with Spansion by making available, as requested by Spansion, management decisions, information, approvals or disapprovals, and acceptances or rejections in a reasonably timely manner so that Spansion may fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.
Approvals.
 
3.9 The Parties shall use the following procedures (the "") to implement Changes.
Change Control Procedures.
Change Control Procedures
 
(a)
General.
 
(i) Changes shall be implemented only by mutual agreement of the Parties through these Change Control Procedures, except as may be necessary on an emergency, temporary basis to maintain the continuity of the Services. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the implementation of a Change does not necessarily require an increase in the Fees or other fees payable by AMD or a reduction in the scope of Services or in Service Levels provided hereunder, and that any change in the Fees or other amounts payable by AMD as a result of a Change will be an adjustment in accordance with the provisions of Section 8. All decisions regarding Changes are subject to the approval by the Board of Directors, which may delegate its decision-making authority to Spansion management as it deems appropriate. The Parties acknowledge and agree that not all modifications to the Services may constitute Changes; as part
Changes.
 
of the routine operation of AMD and Spansion, modifications that are not material or significant, as determined by Spansion in its reasonable judgment, may be conducted without recourse to the Change Control Procedures; provided that the AMD Services Manager is notified  on a regular basis consistent with Spansion's internal processes  of the modifications being implemented on AMD's behalf, with a copy of such report provided to the Fujitsu Services Advisor.
 
(ii) Unless otherwise agreed by AMD, with respect to all Changes, Spansion shall (a) schedule Changes so as not to unreasonably interrupt AMD's business operations, other than those Changes made on a emergency basis to maintain the continuity of the Services, (b) prepare and deliver to AMD each quarter a rolling schedule for ongoing and planned agreed upon Changes for the next quarter, and (c) monitor the status of Changes against the applicable schedule.
Schedule.
 
(iii) The Spansion Services Advisor and the AMD Services Manager shall meet on a mutually agreed schedule (no less frequently than each quarter) for the purpose of reviewing Change requests submitted by either Party in accordance with these Change Control Procedures. The AMD Services Manager will provide the Fujitsu Services Advisor written or telephonic notice of these meetings and the Fujitsu Services Advisor may attend.
Meetings.
 
(b) Requests for Changes shall be submitted for review in accordance with the Change Control Procedures, and shall include a reasonably detailed description of the requested Change together with the basis for such Change. All requests for Changes by AMD shall be communicated to Spansion through the AMD Services Manager or his or her authorized designee.
Requests for Changes.
 
(i) Within ten (10) business days after Spansion receives a request from AMD for a Change, either Spansion or a joint project team working on the Service to be impacted, as appropriate, shall prepare and provide to AMD an initial written proposal for the Change (a ""), which proposal will include Spansion's initial proposals regarding (A) the Services and the applicable schedule for performing the Services, including but not limited to AMD's related obligations, to effect the Change, (B) the resources required to perform Services effecting the Change and resulting from the Change, (C) the Fees for Services, and (D) any additional areas that are reasonably likely to be impacted by the proposed Change. The Change Proposal shall also contain a description of any other anticipated costs that AMD will incur as a result of the Change that it would otherwise not have incurred. Within ten (10) business days after receiving such Change Proposal, AMD shall either approve the Change Proposal, notify Spansion that AMD desires to discuss the Change Proposal further, or withdraw the request for such Change. AMD's failure to approve the Change Proposal or notify Spansion that AMD desires to discuss the Change Proposal further within this ten (10) business day period shall be deemed a rejection of the Change Proposal, and the Change shall not be implemented.
Changes Initiated by AMD.
Change Proposal
 
(ii) Concurrent with the submission of a request for a Change by Spansion, either Spansion or a joint project team working on the impacted Service, as appropriate, shall provide to AMD a Change Proposal containing the information specified in subparagraph (i) above. Within ten (10) business days after receiving such proposal, AMD shall either approve the Change Proposal, notify Spansion that AMD desires to discuss the Change
Changes Initiated by Spansion.
 
Proposal further, or reject the requested Change. AMD's failure to approve the Change Proposal or notify Spansion that AMD desires to discuss the Change Proposal further within this ten (10) business day period shall be deemed a rejection of such request, and the Change shall not be implemented.
 
(c) If within ten (10) business days after receipt of a Change Proposal, AMD notifies Spansion that AMD desires to discuss the proposed Change further, the AMD Services Manager and Spansion Services Advisor will promptly consider the Change Proposal in person or by telephone and will attempt in good faith to develop a mutually acceptable Change Proposal. The AMD Services Manager will notify the Fujitsu Services Advisor of the proposed meeting and the Fujitsu Services Advisor may attend any such meeting.
Further Discussion of Changes.
 
(d) All Changes are subject to the written approval of the Parties. Only following receipt of each Party's written approval may Spansion begin to implement the approved Change, and any Change so approved by each Party that affects any Statement of Work shall be deemed to be an amendment to such Statement of Work.
Implementation of Changes.
 
(e) If a Service Level failure, reasonable safety concern, Governmental Authority or change in Law, requires an immediate Change to a Service, then Spansion may implement such Change immediately upon notice to AMD, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor. Any change in Fees or equipment or technology purchases for which Spansion seeks reimbursement from AMD, or any long-term, material degradation in Service Levels resulting from such Change, unless such degradation is unavoidably required in the circumstances (in which event Spansion shall use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such degradation), shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures.
Emergency Changes.
 
3.10 AMD may from time to time during the Term request that Spansion perform Special Projects. Upon receipt of such a request from AMD, Spansion shall provide AMD with a written proposal for such Special Project which shall include:
Special Projects.
 
(a) a description of the services, functions and responsibilities Spansion anticipates performing in connection with such Special Project;
 
(b) a description of the obligations of AMD, if any, required for Spansion to perform such Special Project;
 
(c) a schedule for commencing and completing such Special Project;
 
(d) Spansion's prospective fees for such Special Project, either on a fixed fee or time and materials basis; and
 
(e) when appropriate, a description of any new Software or equipment required in connection with such Special Project.
 
Spansion shall not begin performing any Special Project until the Parties have agreed in writing upon the specifications, requirements, schedule and fees for such Special Project pursuant to the Change Control Procedures. AMD shall have the right to contract with a third party to perform any Special Project, provided that the Special Project does not affect the provision of Services and would not result in the breach of an obligation that Spansion may have with a third party. AMD will notify Spansion of any proposal that AMD wants to make to a third party to perform a Special Project instead of having Spansion perform that Special Project. If the Parties do not agree upon terms by which Spansion will perform a Special Project, or if Spansion objects to AMD retaining a third party to perform the Special Project because Spansion reasonably believes in good faith that such Special Project, or the third party's performance of that Special Project, will negatively affect the Services, either by reducing performance or functionality, or increasing the cost to Spansion, or by causing Spansion to breach an obligation to a third party, each Party shall have the right to escalate the issue to the Board of Directors, and the Parties shall in good faith negotiate a mutually-acceptable resolution to the matter. If AMD does retain a third party to perform a Special Project hereunder, then Spansion and AMD will agree in writing upon any changes to the Services, Service Levels (if applicable), Fees that result from AMD retaining the third party and commissioning the Special Project.
 
 
4.1 Pursuant to separate statements of work attached hereto and made a part hereof (""), Spansion, either itself or through its Affiliates or subcontractors (subject to Section 4.5), shall perform the services, functions, and responsibilities for AMD identified in the separate Statements of Work (the ""). The Statements of Work may be updated by the Parties from time to time upon mutual agreement pursuant to the Change Control Procedures or the annual review of the AMD general administrative services budget and the Services described in Section 8.7 (the ""). Spansion will provide AMD the Services under terms (including those related to charges, cost allocation and service levels) that are at least as favorable as those it provides any other Spansion business unit, division or Spansion Affiliate receiving similar services from Spansion (or an Spansion subcontractor), subject to any deviations agreed to by the Parties to address AMD's specific requirements as communicated to Spansion and taking into account that this Agreement provides for a cost plus allocation budgeting structure that may not apply to other Spansion business units, divisions or Affiliates. The Services (including any new Services added pursuant to mutual agreement by the Parties) will evolve and be supplemented, modified, enhanced or replaced, reduced or eliminated over time as agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to the Change Control Procedures or as part of the Annual Budget Process. Fees are subject to the quarterly budget reconciliation process described in Section 8.8.

4.2 Spansion shall obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for Spansion to deliver the Services under this Agreement. AMD shall obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for AMD to use the Services under this Agreement. Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall provide to the requesting Party reasonable cooperation and assistance in obtaining Governmental Approvals hereunder.
Governmental Approvals.
 
4.3 If either Party becomes aware of any changes in Law that relate to Spansion's delivery of the Services or AMD's use of the Services, then such Party will

notify the other Party of such changes in Law. With respect to any changes related to Spansion's delivery of Services, Spansion and AMD shall work together pursuant to the Change Control Procedures to identify the impact of such changes on Spansion's delivery of the Services, and any changes in the fees charged to AMD, as a result and shall work together to implement any necessary modifications to the Services prior to the deadline imposed by the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction for such requirement or change. Spansion will use reasonable efforts to minimize the incremental cost to AMD of compliance with such Laws.
 
4.4 Spansion shall comply with all Laws governing the provision of the Services and the performance of its obligations, including identifying and procuring permits, certificates, approvals and inspections required under such Laws. If a charge of non-compliance by Spansion with any such Laws occurs, Spansion shall promptly notify AMD of such charge in writing and Spansion shall promptly remedy such non-compliance in accordance with Law.
Compliance With Laws.
 
4.5 AMD acknowledges that Spansion may outsource to a third party or third parties the performance of some or all of the Services that Spansion is obligated to provide under this Agreement; provided however, that in the event such outsourcing will lead to any Change in Service Levels or Fees, such outsourcing shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Spansion to perform directly any Services outside of the United States and to the extent that Services will be performed outside the United States, Spansion may engage an Affiliate, subsidiary or subcontractor to perform such Services (subject to the Change Control Procedures in accordance with the foregoing). No subcontracting shall release Spansion from its responsibility for its obligations under this Agreement. Spansion shall be responsible for the work and activities of each of the Spansion Agents, including compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Spansion shall be responsible for all payments to its subcontractors unless the Parties agree that AMD will pay directly to a Spansion Affiliate providing Services to AMD.
Subcontractors.
 
4.6 Spansion will coordinate and cooperate in good faith with AMD Agents hired by AMD from time to time to the extent reasonably required by AMD and with Fujitsu to the extent that Fujitsu supplies similar or complementary services to AMD. Spansion will promptly notify AMD if a Fujitsu or any AMD Agent act or omission will cause, or has caused, a problem or delay in providing the Services. Spansion will be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by the interference of a AMD Agent or Fujitsu; provided such interference was not at the direction of Spansion and provided that Spansion continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such interference and works with AMD to resolve the problem and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of Spansion's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable.
AMD Agents.
 
4.7 On a semi-annual basis, Spansion shall provide a report to AMD, with a copy to the Fujitsu Services Advisor, (a) identifying those at Spansion principally responsible for providing Services in each Service area, (b) identifying any significant problems or issues encountered in delivering the Services for each of the Service areas, and (c) identifying
Spansion Reporting.
 
any major changes in the amount of Services or Fees in the Service areas that are expected or planned by Spansion for the upcoming two (2) quarters or year. The Spansion Services Advisor will provide the AMD Services Manager with such other reports regarding the performance of the Services and the Fees as the AMD Services Manager shall reasonably require.
 
4.8 AMD may independently analyze Spansion's compliance with the Service Levels and provide Spansion feedback regarding Spansion's performance. In addition, if as part of that benchmarking, AMD in good faith determines that the pricing it is charged for the Services is not within a reasonable range, AMD may notify Spansion and the Parties will consider whether changes are appropriate to the Services to enable the Parties to enjoy better pricing. Any such benchmarking shall be subject to the confidentiality restriction set forth in Section 11.
AMD Benchmarking.
 
4.9 AMD may not remarket or sell all or any portion of the Services provided under this Agreement, or make all or any portion of the Services available to any party other than AMD or AMD's Affiliates, without Spansion's consent.
Use of Services.
 
 
5.1 Spansion shall perform the Services at a minimum in conformance with the level of service and with at least the same degree of accuracy, quality, completeness, timeliness, responsiveness and efficiency as Spansion provides similar services to its other divisions or Affiliates ("").
Service Levels.

5.2
Dispute Escalation Process.
 
(a) . If the AMD Services Manager determines that Spansion has failed to perform the Services in accordance with the applicable Service Levels, the AMD Services Manager may initiate contact with the Spansion Services Advisor to discuss the deficiency, and if necessary may submit a Change Proposal regarding a corrective action plan in accordance with the Change Control Procedures. Upon such contact, the AMD Services Manager and Spansion Services Advisor will promptly consider the corrective action plan in person or by telephone and will attempt in good faith to agree to a mutually acceptable corrective action plan. The AMD Services Manager will invite the Fujitsu Services Advisor to attend any such meetings. If the Parties cannot agree upon a corrective action plan within a fifteen (15) day business day period, the issue will be escalated in accordance with clause (b) below.
Initial Notice; Good Faith Discussion
 
(b) . If the issue is not resolved in accordance with clause (a) above, the AMD Services Manager will notify the Spansion chief financial officer of the issue. If the Spansion chief financial officer reasonably determines that the issue warrants further escalation, the Spansion chief financial officer will then contact the person within Spansion in charge of the provision of the Services at issue to discuss the issue in person or by telephone and the Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the issue for a period of twenty-five (25) business days. If the issue is not resolved, as agreed by the Parties, within such twenty-five (25) business day period, the issue will be escalated in accordance with the dispute resolution proceedings in accordance with Section 13.
Management Escalation
 
 
6.1
Service Locations.
 
(a) The Services shall be provided to AMD from the AMD Service Locations and the Spansion Service Locations established on the Effective Date or subsequently changed in accordance with the terms hereof. In the event Spansion desires to establish or move Services to a AMD Service Location, such action shall either be approved through the Change Control Procedures or be approved in writing by the AMD Services Manager.
 
(b) Except as provided in Section 8 and unless otherwise agreed by AMD, any incremental expenses incurred by AMD or Spansion and any costs incurred in connection with the performance or use of the Services, in each case as a result of Spansion's relocation to, or use of, any different Service Locations at Spansion's request, shall be paid by Spansion or reimbursed to AMD by Spansion. Any incremental expenses incurred by AMD or Spansion as a result of a relocation to, or use of, any different Service Locations at AMD's request or direction shall be paid by AMD or reimbursed to Spansion by AMD.
 
6.2
AMD Resources and Facilities.
 
(a) For so long as Spansion requires the same for the performance of the Services, subject to AMD's agreement (not to be unreasonably withheld), AMD shall provide to Spansion at no charge access to and the use of the space in the AMD Service Locations, together with personal computers, workstations, terminals, printers, and other equipment utilized by AMD, office furnishings, telephone equipment, janitorial services, utilities and other reasonable resources in connection with Spansion's performance of the Services. Use of AMD Service Locations by Spansion does not constitute a leasehold interest in favor of Spansion, and Spansion shall not have exclusive access or control of the space provided to Spansion under this Agreement.
 
(b) Spansion and Spansion Agents shall not commit or permit waste or damage to such facilities, nor use such facilities for any unlawful purpose or act, and shall comply with all of AMD's general and site-specific policies and procedures generally applicable to the applicable AMD Service Location (as in effect from time to time and of which AMD has provided notice to Spansion), including procedures for the physical security of the AMD Service Locations.
 
(c) Spansion shall permit AMD and AMD Agents to enter into those portions of the AMD Service Locations occupied by Spansion's staff at any time to perform facilities-related services. AMD shall ensure that AMD and AMD Agents shall not interfere with Spansion's performance of Services while exercising access rights under this Agreement, and Spansion shall not be liable under this Agreement for its non-performance or its failure to meet the applicable Service Levels to the extent such non-performance or failure is caused by interference by AMD or AMD Agents.
 
6.3 While at the AMD Service Locations, Spansion and Spansion Agents shall (a) comply with the requests, standard rules and regulations of AMD regarding safety and health, personal and professional conduct (including adhering to general safety practices or procedures) generally applicable to such AMD Service Locations, as notified to Spansion from time to time and (b) otherwise conduct themselves in a businesslike manner. If AMD notifies Spansion that a particular member of the Spansion Personnel is not conducting himself or herself in accordance with this Section, Spansion shall promptly (y) investigate the matter and take appropriate action which may include (i) removing the applicable personnel from the Spansion Personnel and providing AMD with prompt notice of such removal and (ii) replacing the applicable personnel with a similarly qualified individual, or (z) take other appropriate disciplinary action to prevent a recurrence. In the event of multiple violations of this Section 6.3 by a particular member of the Spansion Personnel, Spansion shall promptly remove the individual from the Spansion Personnel.
Conduct of Spansion Personnel.
 
6.4
Safety and Security Procedures.
 
(a) Spansion agrees to comply with AMD's physical safety and security procedures for all Services it provides at AMD Service Locations.
 
(b) Spansion will promptly notify AMD if any AMD failure to maintain and enforce (except for enforcement with respect to Spansion Personnel) physical safety and security procedures at AMD Service Locations will cause, or has caused, a material problem or delay for Spansion in providing the Services. Spansion will be excused from failure to meet a Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that a failure to meet such Service Level or otherwise perform its obligations was caused by the AMD failure to maintain and enforce (except for enforcement with respect to Spansion Personnel) physical safety and security procedures at AMD Service Locations; provided that Spansion continues to use reasonable efforts to perform despite such failure and works with AMD to resolve the failure and resume conformance with the Service Levels and performance of Spansion's obligations under this Agreement as soon as practicable.
 
 
7.1 If and to the extent that a Party's performance of any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement is prevented, hindered or delayed by fire, flood, earthquake, elements of nature or acts of God, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or revolutions, or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party (but specifically excluding labor and union-related activities) (each, a ""), and such non-performance, hindrance or delay could not have been prevented by reasonable precautions, then the non-performing, hindered or delayed Party shall be excused for such non-performance, hindrance or delay, as applicable, of those obligations affected by the Force Majeure Event for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues and such Party continues to use reasonable efforts to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay, including through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means. The Party whose performance is prevented, hindered or delayed by a Force Majeure Event shall immediately notify the other Party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and describe in
Force Majeure.
Force Majeure Event
 
reasonable detail the nature of the Force Majeure Event. If a Service cannot be resumed as a result of a Force Majeure Event for a period of time sufficient to materially hinder AMD's ability to continue to operate, but in no event less than thirty (30) days, AMD may obtain such needed Services from a third party; provided however, that if Spansion is thereafter able to resume providing such Service, AMD will again retain Spansion to provide such Service in accordance with this Agreement.
 
 
8.1 In consideration of Spansion providing the Services, AMD shall pay to Spansion the fees set forth in the Statements of Work, as such fees may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the ""). The Fees include Spansion's reasonable, good faith estimates of pass through expenses for third party Software costs and other third party services (such portion of the Fees referred to herein as the ""). Pass-Through Expenses shall be billed at direct cost, without any mark-up. The Fees are subject to change annually in accordance with the Annual Budget Process, as well as in accordance with the Change Control Procedures and the quarterly budget reconciliation process described in Section 8.8. In the event through the Change Control Procedures or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement additional Pass-Through Expenses will be incurred, Spansion will separately identify such additional Pass-Through Expenses in the applicable Statement of Work.
Fees.
Fees
Pass-Through Expenses
 
8.2 Subject to the Change Control Procedures, AMD shall pay Spansion any Special Project Fees agreed upon by the Parties in writing. As of the Amendment Date, there are no approved Special Projects Fees.
Special Project Fees.
 
8.3 After the beginning of each fiscal month of the Term, Spansion shall invoice AMD for (i) all Fees payable for Services performed during the previous fiscal month and all Pass-Through Expenses paid during the previous fiscal month, and (ii) all Special Project Fees, if any, payable for services performed during the previous fiscal month, including in the case of clause (ii) any Reimbursable Expenses incurred by Spansion in performing a Special Project and reimbursable pursuant to Section 8.9.
Invoicing.
 
8.4 Spansion's invoices shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after the end of the fiscal month in which the Services or, if applicable, agreed upon Special Project services, were provided or the costs incurred. Any other sum due Spansion pursuant to this Agreement shall be due and payable within forty-five (45) days after receipt by AMD of an invoice from Spansion. All payments will be made via wire transfer or other mutually-acceptable means.
Time of Payment.
 
8.5 Within thirty (30) days after AMD's receipt of each invoice, AMD shall give notice to Spansion of any amount shown in such invoice that AMD disputes in good faith, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of the disputed amount and the grounds for the dispute.
Fee Dispute.
 
8.6 Spansion will calculate Fees and costs charged to AMD using a cost allocation methodology that accurately and fairly reflects Spansion's reasonable, good faith
Cost Allocation.
 
forecasts of its actual costs associated with providing the Services and with a reasonable allocation to AMD based on the provision of Services to AMD and the costs therefor as a proportion of total services and costs Spansion provides for itself, for AMD and for any other division or Affiliate of Spansion. Spansion agrees that the target of the Fees and costs charged to AMD will be Spansion's actual costs in performing the Services. Spansion shall set the Fees each year as part of the Annual Budget Process at such reasonable, good faith projection of actual costs (and any overhead costs allocated according to the principle set forth in the first sentence of this Section) plus five percent (5%) of Spansion's costs, excluding Pass-Through Expenses. AMD acknowledges, however, that due to events that occur in between the quarterly reconciliations described in Section 8.8, the Fees may not accurately reflect Spansion's actual costs. In such event and to such extent, Spansion will not be deemed in breach of its obligation to charge Fees based on its reasonable, good faith estimates of actual costs, provided Spansion uses diligent and good faith efforts to establish its actual costs as the basis for reconciling Fees under Section 8.8 and developing future budgets pursuant to the Annual Budget Process. The Fees will be analyzed and updated pursuant to Section 8.8 and the Annual Budget Process.
 
8.7 Each year, in accordance with Spansion's normal budget process, AMD and Spansion will meet and address changes to the Services and the applicable Fees for the succeeding fiscal year and the Parties will agree in writing upon the Services, Service Levels (as applicable) and Fees for the succeeding year.
Annual Budget Process.
 
8.8 In addition to adjustments that may be discussed pursuant to the Annual Budget Process, the Fees shall be adjusted on a prospective basis by mutual written agreement on a quarterly basis (excluding the quarter when the Annual Budget Process will take the place of the quarterly reconciliation process) if a major event has occurred during the quarter that will substantially increase or decrease the actual costs of the Services in the future versus the then-current mutually-agreed budget (e.g., Spansion realizes substantial cost savings as the result of an outsourcing transaction). As part of this quarterly reconciliation process, adjustments to budgeted Fees (including Pass-Through Expenses), whether resulting in an increase or decrease in Fees (including Pass-Through Expenses), will be mutually agreed upon by Spansion and AMD and will apply prospectively only.
Price Protection; Quarterly Budget Reconciliation.
 
8.9 AMD shall pay or reimburse Spansion for its Reimbursable Expenses incurred in connection with its performance of Special Projects as may be agreed on a project by project basis. Except as provided in the previous sentence or as otherwise agreed through the Change Control Procedures, Spansion shall not charge AMD for any expenses or costs incurred by Spansion in providing Special Project services.
Expenses.
 
8.10 All periodic Fees under this Agreement are to be computed on a fiscal month basis and shall be prorated on a per diem basis for any partial fiscal month.
Proration.
 
8.11 In the event AMD in good faith believes that there is a material difference between actual costs incurred by Spansion and the Fees, AMD shall be entitled to appoint an auditor reasonably acceptable to Spansion to audit the cost allocation methodologies used by Spansion to calculate the Fees, the allocation of Fees and Pass-Through Expenses, and to
Audits.
 
otherwise verify the accuracy of the Fees and expenses that Spansion charges AMD for provision of Services under this Agreement. AMD may conduct one such audit annually upon reasonable advance written notice to Spansion delivered through the Spansion Services Advisor. Spansion agrees to provide such auditor with access to all data, records, reports, resources, facilities and personnel necessary to enable the auditor to conduct appropriate audits of the Fees charged to AMD. The auditor shall promptly report any discrepancies in writing to AMD, with a copy to the Spansion Services Advisor and the Fujitsu Services Advisor. Any copies provided the Fujitsu Services Advisor shall only include the results of the auditor's analysis and shall be deemed Confidential Information of AMD. Any discrepancy discovered shall be promptly rectified as part of the next quarter's budget reconciliation process, whether such discrepancy resulted in an overpayment or underpayment of Fees. All such audits shall be at AMD's expense. Spansion agrees to retain all pertinent records to justify its allocation of Fees and costs to AMD for a period of two (2) years after provision of the applicable Service. In addition, in the event Spansion conducts an audit (either by itself or through an independent auditor) of a third party providing any Services (or any part thereof), Spansion shall make all such audit results available to AMD promptly upon Spansion's receipt thereof (and shall pass on to AMD any adjustment pursuant to the budget reconciliation process).
 
 
9.1 Except as specifically set forth in this Section 9, the Fees paid to Spansion are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, gross receipts, excise, value-added, personal property, services or other Taxes (other than withholding taxes) ("") attributable to periods on or after the Effective Date. In the event that AMD is prohibited by law from making any payment of Fees unless withholding taxes are deducted or withheld therefrom, then AMD shall deduct such amounts as are necessary and pay the net amount to Spansion after such deduction or withholding. AMD shall promptly furnish Spansion with a copy of an official tax receipt or other appropriate evidence of any withholding taxes imposed on payments made under this Agreement. As part of this Agreement, AMD shall issue Spansion such valid tax exemption certificate(s) for the various state and local taxing authorities as AMD may legally issue and Spansion may legally and reasonably request to cover Transaction Taxes legally imposed upon the transactions arising out of this Agreement. In the event that a Transaction Tax is assessed against Spansion on the provision of the Services by Spansion to AMD or on the Fees, however levied or assessed, AMD shall reimburse Spansion for or provide acceptable proof that AMD has paid said amounts directly to the appropriate taxing authority. AMD shall accrue and pay the appropriate amount of Taxes due to any state or local taxing authority for Transaction Taxes . AMD will be responsible for the proper reporting of Transaction Taxes to the taxing authorities, and any charges associated with such filings, including but not limited to, interest or penalties due to the taxing authorities. Spansion and AMD agree to mutually cooperate in a reasonable manner for the purpose of minimizing all Transaction Taxes that are to be paid directly or indirectly by AMD. Spansion grants AMD the right to pursue a separate action against any governmental unit which asserts Transaction Taxes and Spansion agrees to cooperate in a reasonable manner with AMD if such action is taken.
General.

9.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the Parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound, each Party shall be permitted to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby (and any related transactions or arrangements). This permission to disclose includes the ability of each Party to consult, without limitation of any kind, any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby (and any related transactions or arrangements). This provision is intended to comply with Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(ii)(B) of the Treasury Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
