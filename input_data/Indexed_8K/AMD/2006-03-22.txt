Item 1.01 Entry into Material Agreement.
On March 16, 2006, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") granted restricted stock units pursuant to the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan to its executive officers named below (the "Executives"). Restricted stock units are awards that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The Executives must remain continuously employed by the Company throughout the three-year vesting period for the restricted stock units to vest, and the Company must achieve certain performance levels during that same period for the restricted stock units to vest. Specifically, the Company must achieve minimum revenue growth based on our compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") as compared to certain select semiconductor companies during our 2006 through 2008 fiscal years, and the Company must achieve a minimum target operating income margin based on a three-year average during that same period for the restricted stock units to vest.
In the event that the Company does not attain the minimum performance levels during our 2006 through 2008 fiscal years the restricted stock units will not vest. The following table shows the number of restricted stock units that may become vested at certain performance levels with respect to each of the Company's executive officers named below:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
