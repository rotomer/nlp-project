On such date, shares of Parent Common Stock (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) and cash, if any, to which the former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no consideration to Parent SubCo, together with all entitlements to dividends, distributions, cash and interest in respect thereof held for such former holder.

To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the holder of the securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that the amount so required or entitled to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion, if any, of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Company, Parent, Parent FinanceCo, Parent SubCo and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of, on behalf of such holder, such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Company, Parent FinanceCo, Parent or Parent SubCo or the Depositary, as the case may be, to

In the event such approvals cannot be obtained, the affected Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs shall be cancelled for no consideration and each Company Common Shareholder who is resident in India who would otherwise be entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for their Company Common Shares will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the net proceeds after expenses received by the Depositary upon the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Company Common Shareholder would otherwise be entitled. The Depositary will sell such shares of Parent Common Stock by private sale (including by way of sale through the facilities of the NYSE) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date.

In such case, the affected Company Options, Company SARs and Company RSUs shall be cancelled for no consideration and each Company Common Shareholder who is resident in such jurisdiction who would otherwise be entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for their Company Common Shares will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the net proceeds after expenses received by the Depositary upon the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Company Common Shareholder would otherwise be entitled. The Depositary will sell such shares of Parent Commons Stock by private sale (including by way of sale through the facilities of the NYSE) as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date. The aggregate net proceeds after expenses of such sale will be distributed by the Depositary to the Company Common Shareholder who is resident in such jurisdiction who would otherwise be entitled to receive Parent Common Stock.

(xiii) None of the Employee Plans require or permit a retroactive increase in premiums or payments, and the level of insurance reserves, if any, under any self-insured Employee Plan is reasonable and sufficient to provide for all incurred but unreported claims. All employer and employee obligations in respect of the Employee Plans, including payments, contributions and premiums required under applicable Laws and their terms have been satisfied. Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the Arrangement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will result in any bonus, golden parachute, severance or other payment or obligation to any current or former employee or director of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether or not under any Employee Plan), or materially increase the benefits payable or provided under any Employee Plan, or result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits. The Company has delivered and disclosed to Parent any and all copies (or accurate and complete descriptions thereof if unwritten) of Employee Plans, together with, as applicable, accurate and complete copies of any and all Contracts, for Parent to make a good faith estimate of the total amount of all payments and the fair market value of all non-cash benefits that may become payable or provided to any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Employee Plans (assuming for such purpose that such individual's employment were terminated immediately following the Effective Time).

(xviii) No payment pursuant to any Employee Plans or other arrangement to any "service provider" (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance thereunder), including the grant, vesting, modification or exercise of any Company Equity Award, would subject any Person to tax pursuant to Section 409A(1) of the Code, whether pursuant to the consummation of the Arrangement, any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.
(xix) All Company Equity Awards have been appropriately authorized by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, including approval of the exercise or purchase price or the methodology for determining the exercise or purchase price and the substantive terms of the Company Equity Awards. All Company Options granted to employees in the United States reflect the fair market value of the Company's Common Shares as determined under Section 409A of the Code on the date the option was granted (within the meaning of United States Treasury Regulation 1.421-1(c)). No Company Equity Awards have been retroactively granted, or the exercise or purchase price of any Company Equity Award determined retroactively.
