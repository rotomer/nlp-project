Credit Agreement
On October 24, 2006, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Collateral Agent ("Wells Fargo"), and the lenders party thereto (the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company borrowed an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion of term loans ("Term Loans") to finance a portion of the Company's acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of ATI Technologies Inc. ("ATI") and related fees and expenses.
Amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement bear interest, in the case of base rate loans, at a rate equal to the "base rate," which is the higher of (i) the prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal and (ii) 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 1.25% margin, or in the case of Eurodollar loans, at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 2.25% margin. Such margins will reduce by 0.25% when the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans is less than $1.75 billion. As of October 24, 2006, the base rate was 8.25%, without the margin, and the Eurodollar Rate was 5.32%, without the margin. The amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in December 2006 and terminating in December 2013. The initial twenty-five quarterly payments are in the principal amount of $6,250,000. The final four quarterly repayments are in the principal amount of $585,973,500. The initial interest rate on the Term Loans, which is based on the Eurodollar Rate, is 7.57%.
The Company may prepay the Term Loans at any time without premium or penalty. In addition, the Company must prepay the Term Loans in an amount equal to: (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds from any debt incurred by the Company or a restricted subsidiary; (ii) 50% of net cash proceeds from the issuance of any capital stock by the Company; (iii) 100% of extraordinary receipts (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in excess of $30 million; (iv) 100% of net cash proceeds from asset sales in excess of $30 million, subject to a reinvestment allowance; (v) commencing with the fiscal year ending December 30, 2007, 50% of excess cash flow, if any (as defined in the Credit Agreement); and (vi) 100% of net cash proceeds from sale of capital stock of Spansion Inc.
The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company's ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries (which at this time are all of its subsidiaries) from:

In connection with the Credit Agreement and the Collateral Agreement, the Grantors and Wells Fargo, as Collateral Agent, entered into a collateral trust agreement (the "Collateral Trust Agreement") whereby Wells Fargo will hold in trust the pledged collateral under the Collateral Agreement.

In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.

In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such

The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
provided
9.8 . Each Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.
Agent in Its Individual Capacity
9.9 . (a) The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. Such resignation shall take effect immediately unless otherwise indicated by the Required Lenders. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be (unless an Event of Default under Section 9(a) or 9(f) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

6.4. . In addition to the rights of the Secured Parties specified in Section 6.1 with respect to payments of Accounts Receivable, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the Collateral Agent has instructed any Grantor to do so, all Proceeds received by such Grantor consisting of cash, checks and other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor in trust for the Secured Parties, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Collateral Agent in the exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Collateral Agent, if required).

6.5. . All Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, all or any part of the collateral shall be applied by the Collateral Agent against all or any part of the Obligations as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Collateral Trust Agreement.

6.6. . If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Collateral Agent may exercise, in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other Loan Document, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC or any other applicable law or in equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Collateral Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of any Agent or any Secured Party or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Any Secured Party shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released. Each Grantor further agrees, at the Collateral Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Collateral Agent at places which the Collateral Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. The Collateral Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.6, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such order as set forth in Section 6.5, and only after such application and after the payment by the Collateral Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, including Section 9-615(a)(3) of the New York UCC, need the Collateral Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against any Secured Party arising out of the exercise of any rights hereunder other than any such claims, damages and demands that may arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Secured Party. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral is required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.
Code and Other Remedies
6.7. .
Registration Rights
(a) Each Grantor recognizes that the Collateral Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock pledged hereunder, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may
 
result in prices and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock pledged hereunder for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.
(b) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to be done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all or any portion of the Pledged Stock pledged hereunder pursuant to this Section 6.7 valid and binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of Law.
6.8. . Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay its Obligations and the fees and disbursements of any attorneys employed by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to collect such deficiency.

The Collateral Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
(b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein, the Collateral Agent, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply with, or cause performance or compliance with, such agreement.
(c) The expenses of the Collateral Agent incurred in connection with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.1, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum at which interest would then be payable on past due Base Rate Loans under the Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Collateral Agent to the date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the Collateral Agent on demand.

All powers, authorizations and agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable as to each Grantor until this Agreement is terminated and all security interests created hereby with respect to the Collateral of such Grantor are released.
7.2. . The Collateral Agent's sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Collateral Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the Collateral Agent, any Secured Party nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof. The powers conferred on the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder are solely to protect the Secured Parties' interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Collateral Agent or any Secured Parties to exercise any such powers. The Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except, in the case of the Collateral Agent only in respect of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, to the extent required by applicable law (subject to Section 10.12(e) of the Credit Agreement and other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents).

AMD (NYSE:AMD) today announced the completion of its approximately $5.4 billion acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc. Combining the complementary strengths of the two technology leaders, the new AMD opens for business as a processing powerhouse committed to driving innovation, choice and growth in the technology industry. With approximately 15,000 employees, the company merges AMD's technology leadership in microprocessors together with ATI's leadership in graphics, chipsets and consumer electronics.
SUNNYVALE, CALIF.  Oct. 25, 2006 
"Today marks a historic day for our employees, our partners and our customers as we officially welcome ATI into the AMD family," said AMD Chairman and CEO Hector Ruiz. "On day one, we are delivering a winning set of complementary technologies, igniting a new level of innovation and continuing to champion choice for the industry. Thanks to the strength of our talented employees, the new AMD now has a full range of intellectual property (IP) in microprocessors, graphics, chipsets and consumer electronics to deliver open platforms and integrated solutions. In the near term, customers gain a new level of choice, and in the long term, we believe the possibilities for innovation are truly limitless."
Transaction Details
Under the terms of the transaction, AMD acquired all of the outstanding common shares of ATI for a combination of approximately $4.3 billion in cash and 58 million shares of AMD common stock, based on the number of shares of ATI common stock outstanding on October 24, 2006. All outstanding options and restricted stock units (RSUs) of ATI were assumed. The value of the ATI acquisition of approximately $5.4 billion is based upon the closing stock price of AMD common stock on October 24, 2006 of $20.32 per share and excludes the value of assumed equity awards.
AMD financed the cash portion of the transaction with a combination of cash and new debt. AMD obtained a $2.5 billion term loan from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., which, together with combined existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances of approximately $1.8 billion, provided full funding for the transaction.
AMD announced the final pro-ration applicable to ATI common shares in the acquisition. The total consideration to be paid for each common share, based on the Parent Closing Stock Price (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement, as amended), is approximately $21.36. The final election results indicate that pro-ration is as follows:
 
 
 
Pro-ration was necessary because the cash consideration elected to be received exceeded the amount of cash available in the acquisition. Any fractional shares will be paid in cash.
Planning to Deliver Integrated Platforms in 2007
Customers should benefit from AMD's and ATI's combined platform development and technical support teams, which will be co-located in Taipei and Shanghai. Combined with the existing Austin and Toronto locations, these sites offer research and development and support to provide customers with a complete solution for optimized platform development.
 
AMD plans to deliver a range of integrated platforms in 2007 to serve key markets, including: commercial clients; mobile computing; and gaming and media computing. PC users will benefit from innovations intended to extend battery life on the next-generation AMD Turion 64 mobile technology-based platform and enhancements to the AMD LIVE! digital media PC platform that will enable users to get more from their favorite photos, music, and movies. AMD believes that these integrated platform innovations will bring customers improved system stability, better time-to-market, increased performance and energy-efficiency and overall, an enhanced user experience.
"By driving innovation and integration in processing, especially in graphics, the new AMD has the potential to empower breakthrough computing experiences for users of Windows Vista," said Jim Allchin, Co-President of Microsoft's Platforms & Services Division. "We are excited by the potential benefits that this union can bring to enhance the Windows Vista experience."
AMD also sees an opportunity to deliver processing solutions to the growing consumer electronics market. The company intends to leverage ATI's strength in the consumer market by pursuing new opportunities to invest in the consumer electronics and high-end discrete graphics markets. With leading technology and customer relationships, AMD is positioned to address digital convergence by leveraging critical IP to create new innovations and devices that facilitate end-to-end content delivery and connectivity to improve end-user experiences.
CPU/GPU Silicon "Fusion"  Another Industry First for Customers
AMD plans to create a new class of x86 processor that integrates the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) at the silicon level with a broad set of design initiatives collectively codenamed "Fusion." AMD intends to design Fusion processors to provide step-function increases in performance-per-watt relative to today's CPU-only architectures, and to provide the best customer experience in a world increasingly reliant upon 3D graphics, digital media and high-performance computing.
With Fusion processors, AMD will continue to promote an open platform and encourage companies throughout the ecosystem to create innovative new co-processing solutions aimed at further optimizing specific workloads. AMD-powered Fusion platforms will continue to fully support high-end discrete graphics, physics accelerators, and other PCI Express-based solutions to meet the ever-increasing needs of the most demanding enthusiast end-users.
 
"With the anticipated launch of Windows Vista, robust 3D graphics, digital media and device convergence are driving the need for greater performance, graphics capabilities, and battery life," said Phil Hester, AMD senior vice president and chief technology officer. "In this increasingly diverse x86 computing environment, simply adding more CPU cores to a baseline architecture will not be enough. As x86 scales from palmtops to petaFLOPS, modular processor designs leveraging both CPU and GPU compute capabilities will be essential in meeting the requirements of computing in 2008 and beyond."
Fusion processors are expected in late 2008/early 2009, and the company expects to use them within all of the company's priority computing categories, including laptops, desktops, workstations and servers, as well as in consumer electronics and solutions tailored for the unique needs of emerging markets.
