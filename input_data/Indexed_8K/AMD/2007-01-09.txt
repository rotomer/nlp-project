ITEM 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
.
On October 24, 2006, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") closed the acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc. ("ATI"), pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, dated as of July 23, 2006 (the "Acquisition Agreement"), by and among the Company, 1252986 Alberta ULC ("Alberta ULC"), and ATI, whereby ATI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alberta ULC. As contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement implemented in connection therewith, the total consideration paid for each ATI common share, based on the Parent Closing Stock Price (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement, as amended, attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company's Report on Form 8-K (the "Original 8-K") filed on October 30, 2006 and incorporated herein by reference), is $21.36. The total aggregate consideration for the acquisition consisted of approximately $4.26 billion in cash and 57,946,017 shares of the Company's common stock, which had a value of approximately $1.2 billion based on the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the three trading days prior to October 25, 2006. In addition, as part of the consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued options to purchase 17,091,500 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,231,026 restricted stock units.

Consolidated Financial Statements
(In U.S. dollars)
ATI TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Years ended August 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of ATI Technologies Inc. as at August 31, 2006 and 2005 and the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
With respect to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2006, we conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). With respect to the consolidated financial statements for each of the years in the two-year period ended August 31, 2005, we conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at August 31, 2006 and 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended August 31, 2006 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles vary in certain significant respects from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.

COMMENTS BY AUDITORS FOR U.S. READERS ON CANADA - U.S. REPORTING DIFFERENCES
To the Board of Directors of ATI Technologies Inc.
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) that refers to the audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our report to the shareholders dated November 30, 2006 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards, which do not require a reference to the audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in the financial statement auditors' report.
In addition, in the United States, reporting standards for auditors also require the addition of an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) when there is a change in accounting principles that has a material effect on the comparability of the Company's financial statements, such as the change described in note 1(o) to the consolidated financial statements. Our report to the shareholders dated November 30, 2006 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards which do not require a reference to such changes in accounting principles in the auditors' report when the change is properly accounted for and adequately disclosed in the financial statements.

The principal business activities of ATI Technologies Inc. (the "Company") are the design, manufacture and sale of innovative 3D graphics and digital media silicon solutions. The Company markets its products to original equipment manufacturers, system builders, distributors and retailers primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
 
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles ("Canadian GAAP") and are presented in U.S. dollars. No material differences would result if these consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, except as disclosed in note 21.
 
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as the Company's proportionate 50.0% ownership in a joint venture formed to own an office building in Markham, Ontario. All of the Company's subsidiaries are wholly owned with the exception of ATI Finland Oy ("ATI Finland"), which as of August 31, 2006, was 96.2% owned. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The Company has recorded a non-controlling interest on its balance sheet in respect of ATI Finland to reflect the related minority interest.
 
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of less than 90 days from the acquisition date. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates their fair values. The Company's short-term investments include highly liquid instruments with a maturity date of 90 days or more but less than one year from the acquisition date. Short-term investments include: (i) auction rate paper that is carried at cost, which approximates fair value; (ii) portfolio investments, consisting of actively managed funds holding corporate obligations, agency discount notes, money market funds and commercial paper; and (iii) corporate bonds. Both portfolio investments and corporate bonds are carried at amortized cost plus accrued interest. The Company regularly reviews the carrying value of its investments. Should there be a decline in value that is other than a temporary decline, the Company measures the amount of the write-down based on the quoted market value of the investments and charges such write-down to the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings.

Raw materials are stated at the lower of cost and replacement cost. Finished goods and work in process are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. In determining net realizable value, the Company considers factors such as market conditions, the aging of inventory and forecasted future demand. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
 
Capital assets are recorded at cost, net of related investment tax credits, and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives for principal asset categories are as follows:
 
 
The Company does not amortize goodwill but is required to evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. To the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment of goodwill exists. Impairment is then measured by comparing the fair value of goodwill, determined in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that there was no goodwill impairment.

Intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
 
 
The Company reviews capital and intangible assets for impairment on a regular basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount to the projected undiscounted future net cash flows that the long-lived assets are expected to generate. If the carrying amount exceeds such cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the excess of the assets' carrying value over their fair value.
 
Investees over which the Company does not have control or significant influence are accounted for by the cost method.
The Company regularly reviews the carrying values of its long-term investments. Should there be a decline in value of the Company's long-term investments that is other than a temporary decline, the Company measures the amount of the write-down based on the fair value of the shares of the investee and charges such write-down to the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings.

Revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers, selling price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Sales made to distributors and retailers under agreements allowing for price protection and/or rights of return are recognized at the time of sale to these customers. Estimated returns and allowances, price protection and sales rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition. Estimates are based on historical experience, planned customer incentive programs and other relevant factors. If estimates of future market conditions and changing product life cycles in the marketplace are inaccurate, it may be necessary to increase customer incentive offerings, which could necessitate a further reduction in revenue. Such increases are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time the program is introduced, anticipated or enhanced. The Company also provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of revenue recognition.
The Company primarily uses a binding purchase order as evidence of its sales arrangements and, in certain cases, uses contractual agreements. The Company considers delivery to occur upon shipment, provided risk and rewards of ownership, including transfer of title, have passed to the customer. At the point of sale, the Company assesses whether collection is reasonably assured. If the Company determines that collection is not reasonably assured, the Company defers recognition of the revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
The Company follows the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contracts requiring the Company to develop customized technology to meet a customer's specifications. Under such contracts, revenue is recognized based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to overall estimated costs. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts, if any, are recognized when identified.

Where estimating the final outcome of a project is impractical, except to ensure that no loss will be incurred, the Company uses a zero estimate of profit until results can be estimated more precisely. Under this method, the portion of total contract revenue earned to date is determined by measuring total cost incurred. The Company then records an equal amount of revenue against costs. Cost of revenues is adjusted to recognize the profit element from the arrangement once the Company is able to estimate total revenue and total costs.
Cash received from customers in advance of the Company meeting its applicable revenue recognition criteria is recorded as deferred revenue.
 
The Company's functional currency and that of its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The Company's subsidiaries are accounted for as integrated foreign operations. Transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries originating in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing rates approximating those at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rates of exchange and non-monetary items are translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting net gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings.
 
Research costs, other than capital expenditures, are expensed as incurred. Development costs are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria under Canadian GAAP for deferral and amortization. The Company has not deferred any such development costs to date. R&D costs are reduced by related investment tax credits. The total investment tax credits for fiscal 2006 amounted to $45.3 million (2005 - $45.5 million; 2004 - $29.0 million).

Years ended August 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
 
 
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Future income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, net operating loss carryforwards and undeducted R&D pools. Future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the year that includes the substantive enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against any future income tax asset if it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Income tax expense or recovery is, primarily, the sum of the Company's provision for current income taxes and the difference between opening and closing balances of future income tax assets and liabilities.
 
Basic net income per share has been calculated by dividing the net income for the year by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating diluted net income per share. Diluted net income per share is computed similar to basic net income per share, except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and equity-settled restricted share units ("RSUs"), if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock options and RSUs were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the reporting year.

The Company has share option plans, which are described in note 12. Any consideration paid by employees on exercise of stock options or purchase of stock is credited to share capital.
On September 1, 2004, the Company adopted the revised Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' ("CICA") Handbook Section 3870, Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments, which requires the application of a fair value method of accounting to all stock-based compensation arrangements with employees. As a result, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of the stock options granted and expense that fair value over the service period which, in all cases, equals the vesting period of the stock options. Prior to September 1, 2004, the Company recorded no compensation cost on the grant of stock options to employees. In accordance with the transitional provisions of Section 3870, the Company has retroactively, without restatement, applied the fair value method of accounting for stock option awards granted since September 1, 2002, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and recorded an adjustment to opening retained earnings at September 1, 2004 in the amount of $13.8 million, representing the stock option expense, net of income taxes, for fiscal 2003 and 2004. The offsets to retained earnings are increases in contributed surplus and future income tax assets in the amounts of $17.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The stock option expense for the year ended August 31, 2006 was $33.0 million (2005-$34.0 million).

The following table reports certain pro forma amounts, adjusted to reflect stock-based compensation expense measured by the fair value method based on stock options issued subsequent to September 1, 2002, for the year ended August 31, 2004:
 
 
The Company has RSU and deferred share unit ("DSU") plans, which are described in note 12. For equity-settled RSUs, stock-based compensation, representing the underlying value of the common shares of the Company at the date of grant of the RSUs, is recognized evenly over the three-year vesting period. RSUs and DSUs that will be settled in cash are recorded as liabilities. The measurement of the liability and compensation costs for these awards is based on the intrinsic value of the award and is recorded as a charge to operating income over the vesting period of the award. Changes in the Company's payment obligation subsequent to grant of the award and prior to the settlement date, due to changes in the market value of the underlying Company common shares, are recorded as a charge to operating income in the year incurred. The payment amount is established for cash-settled RSUs as of the vesting date of the award and for DSUs as of the later of the date of termination of employment or directorship.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting years presented. Significant estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for inventory obsolescence, useful lives of long-lived assets, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment testing, valuation of long-term investments, realization of future tax assets, and estimates for sales returns and allowances, price protection and sales rebates. Management makes its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
During fiscal 2004, the Company adopted CICA Accounting Guideline ("AcG") No. 13, Hedging Relationships, for its derivative instruments. The Company engages in activities to purchase certain derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts, to manage its foreign currency exposures. The Company's policy is not to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific firm commitments or anticipated transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The Company purchases forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge anticipated Canadian dollar expenses pertaining to its operations in Canada. These instruments are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements at inception. Foreign exchange gains and losses on these contracts are deferred off-balance sheet and recognized as an adjustment to the operating expenses when the operating expenses are incurred.

Realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with derivative instruments, which have been terminated prior to the occurrence of the hedge transaction or cease to be effective prior to maturity, are deferred under other current, or non-current, assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in income in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. In the event a designated hedged item is sold or extinguished or matures prior to the termination of the related derivative instrument, any realized or unrealized gain or loss on such derivative instrument is recognized in income.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and sundry receivables. The Company invests only in high-quality cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. A majority of the Company's accounts receivable is derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers, add-in-board manufacturers, original design manufacturers, distributors and retailers in the personal computer, cellular phone and digital television industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary. In addition, a significant portion of the total accounts receivable is insured against possible losses. The Company maintains adequate reserves for potential credit losses as estimated by management.
The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, sundry receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair market values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
The fair values of the obligation under capital lease, mortgage payable and long-term notes payable approximate their carrying values.
The financial condition, operating results and cash flows of the Company may be materially and adversely impacted by a substantial weakening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies as the Company's long-term debt and a significant amount of its operating expenses are paid in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts ("Forwards") to hedge its foreign currency exposure on expenses incurred for its Canadian operations. The Forwards obligate the Company to sell U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars in the future at predetermined exchange rates and are matched with anticipated future operating expenses in Canada. The Forwards do not subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements because gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains on exposures being hedged. The counterparties to the Forwards are multinational commercial banks and, therefore, the credit risk of counterparty non-performance is low.
As at August 31, 2006, the Company has Cdn. $142.2 million (2005 - Cdn. $94.5 million) outstanding in Forwards that mature in the next nine months at an average exchange rate of 1.1202. All of the Forwards have become favourable to the Company since their inception and have an unrealized gain of $2.2 million at August 31, 2006 (2005 - $4.7 million).

At August 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of short-term investments approximated their quoted market value. All short-term investments have a minimum credit rating of either A1 by Standard and Poor's or P1 by Moody's.
 
 
At August 31, 2006, the Company had non-cancellable inventory purchase commitments totalling $214.9 million (2005 - $223.6 million).

The purchase and sale agreement with respect to this acquisition also provides for Conditional Payments, as defined, of $5.8 million (Euro 4.5 million) and Milestone Payments, as defined, totalling $8.0 million (Euro 6.2 million). The Conditional Payments of $2.7 million (Euro 2.1 million) are payable on each of the first and second anniversary of the date of acquisition and $0.4 million (Euro 0.3 million) is payable on the third anniversary of the acquisition provided the intended recipients remain employed with the Company on the first and second anniversary dates. The obligations related to these payments are being recognized by a compensation expense charge to the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings over the period to the first and second anniversary dates.

The Milestone Payments, if any, will be made based on the future attainment of certain technological milestones specified in the agreement. These amounts will be recorded as additional purchase price in the future at the time the specified milestones are achieved.
The Company has also entered into a Shareholders' Agreement with the shareholders that continue to hold 3.8% of the shares. The agreement provides the Company with a call option and the shareholders with a put option that can be exercised under certain circumstances.
 
 
As at August 31, 2005, only $2.5 million of the contingency was earned. Additionally, the cash consideration of $11.3 million included $0.75 million which was tied to the last deliverable. As this was not achieved, the Company booked a reduction of $0.75 million to goodwill in fiscal 2006 representing the cash received from Terayon.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company considered it more likely than not that it would be able to realize the future income tax asset acquired in the business combination with Nxtwave Communications Inc. ("Nxtwave"). The future income tax asset was previously not recognized as an identifiable asset. Accordingly, the Company reduced the $4.7 million goodwill acquired in the above-mentioned business combination to zero reflecting the realization of the tax benefit on Nxtwave's pre-acquisition losses.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company considered it more likely than not that it would be able to realize the future income tax asset acquired in the business combination with ArtX, Inc. ("ArtX"). The future income tax asset was previously not recognized as an identifiable asset. Accordingly, the Company reduced the amount of goodwill acquired in the above-mentioned business combination by $1.1 million, reflecting the realization of the tax benefit on ArtX's pre-acquisition losses.

Options are granted under the ATI Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors at exercise prices determined as the weighted average of the trading prices of the Company's common shares on The Toronto Stock Exchange or NASDAQ for the five trading days preceding the effective date of the grant. In general, options granted under the ATI Plan vest over a period of up to four years from the grant date and expire by no later than the seventh anniversary of the date of grant.
Commencing the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company amended the ATI Plan to provide the Board of Directors with the discretion to award tandem stock appreciation rights ("tandem SARs") in connection with all or a portion of the existing and future options granted under the ATI Plan. Tandem SARs provide an optionee with the right to surrender vested options for termination in return for common shares with a market value equal to the net proceeds that the optionee would have otherwise received had such optionee exercised the vested options and immediately sold the underlying shares. Tandem SARs were attached to new option grants only. Options subject to tandem SARs numbered 5,389,778 at August 31, 2006 (2005 - 3,169,015).

The weighted average estimated fair value at the date of grant for the options granted during fiscal 2006 was $7.46 per share (2005 - $8.04; 2004 - $8.96). The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
The estimated fair value of the stock options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the options' vesting period and the related expense for the year ended August 31, 2006 amounted to $33.0 million (2005 - $34.0 million). The stock option expense by functional areas is as follows:
 
 
In October 2003, the Company adopted three plans to grant RSU's as part of its overall stock-based compensation plan. The RSU Plans allow participants to earn actual shares (or, for non-North American participants, the cash equivalent) of the Company over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price.

The RSU Plans include: a plan for Canadian employees and directors; a plan for U.S. employees and directors; and a plan for all other employees and directors outside of North America. In accordance with the terms of the RSU Plans, the Board of Directors approves which employees and directors are entitled to participate in the respective plans and the number of RSUs to be awarded. Each RSU awarded conditionally entitles the participant to the delivery of one common share (or cash in lieu of such share for participants resident outside of North America) upon attainment of the RSU vesting period. RSUs awarded to participants vest in accordance with terms determined by the Board of Directors, which terms may include certain performance criteria in which the number of common shares (or cash in lieu of such common shares for participants resident outside of North America) to be delivered to a participant in respect of each RSU awarded is dependent upon the Company's performance and/or market price of the common shares, as determined by the Board of Directors. At the time that RSUs are granted to participants in North America, the Board of Directors must determine whether the common shares to be delivered to participants upon the vesting of such RSUs will be purchased on the open market, issued from treasury or obtained from a combination of market purchases and treasury issuances. For participants outside of North America, if common shares are not issued from treasury, they are only entitled to receive a cash payment from the Company equal to the number of RSUs awarded to such participants multiplied by the value of the common shares on the NASDAQ Stock Market at the relevant vesting date. Each common share issued from treasury upon the vesting of such RSUs reduces the number of common shares available for issuance under the RSU plans. A total of 3,000,000 common shares have been reserved for issuance from treasury under the RSU Plans. RSUs that are satisfied through the purchase of common shares on the market vest over a maximum period ending December 31 of the third calendar year after the date of grant. Grants of RSUs to participants residing outside of North America are recognized at their face value, whereby the value of the RSUs and their related amortization are adjusted based on the underlying value of the Company's common shares at the end of each fiscal quarter.

During fiscal 2004, the Company granted a total of 1,556,244 RSUs to certain employees to replace the annual grant of options for the 2003 calendar year. The Company advanced $22.1 million to the trustee of the RSU Plans to enable the trustee to purchase the Company's common shares in the open market for future delivery of such shares to the participants on the vesting dates of the RSUs. The cost of the purchase of these shares is classified as treasury stock and presented as a reduction of shareholders' equity in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company also awarded a one-time cash payment of $7.8 million to the non-executive employees who were eligible to participate in the RSU Plans. The full amount of the cash payment was expensed in fiscal 2004.
During fiscal 2005, the Company started granting RSUs to its employees which are settled through the issuance of common shares of the Company from treasury. The number of RSUs granted in fiscal 2006 was 2,242,392 (2005 - 1,183,488), the number of RSUs vested was 749,018 (2005 - 508,803) and the number of RSUs forfeited was 273,874 (2005 - 57,084; 2004 - 42,327). Of the RSUs granted in fiscal 2006, 97,940 are subject to performance-related factors which result in the number of common shares that may be issued upon the settlement of such RSUs at each vesting date being dependent on the Company achieving certain performance targets. As at August 31, 2006, there were 3,351,018 (2005 - 2,131,518) RSUs awarded and outstanding.
The total expenses incurred by functional area for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 pertaining to the amortization of RSUs are summarized in the following table:

During fiscal 2004, the Company established a plan to grant DSUs to its non-management directors. Under this plan, the directors will receive DSUs, in addition to cash payments, as part of their annual compensation package. A DSU is a unit equivalent in value to one common share of the Company based on the five-day average trading price of the Company's common shares on the NASDAQ (the "Weighted Average Price") immediately prior to the date on which the value of the DSU is determined. DSUs vest quarterly over a period of one year and may not be redeemed until the director leaves the Board, thereby providing an ongoing equity stake in the Company throughout the director's period of service. On termination or retirement from the Board, directors will be able to redeem DSUs during the six-month period following their departure from the Board. DSUs, however, must be redeemed prior to the end of the year following departure from the Board, based on the Weighted Average Price at the time of redemption. Alternatively, a director may elect to receive RSUs in lieu of DSUs provided the market value of his holdings in the Company's common stock equity is greater than $350,000. DSUs granted during fiscal 2006 numbered 45,500 (2005 - 40,625). As at August 31, 2006, there were 178,207 DSUs outstanding, of which 159,249 were vested.
As of the date of the grant, the fair values of the DSUs outstanding, being the fair market value of the Company's common shares at that date, are recorded as a liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the one-year vesting period of the DSU. The value of the DSU liability is adjusted to reflect changes in the market value of the Company's common shares. The expense for fiscal 2006 related to DSUs granted to the directors for services rendered was $2.1 million (2005 - $0.2 million).

During fiscal 2006, a net total of $24.3 million was added to contributed surplus, of which $33.0 million and $14.2 million related to the amortization of stock option expense and RSU expense, respectively. The above increase was partly offset by $10.7 million worth of RSUs granted to employees that were exchanged for common shares upon vesting of the RSUs and $11.6 million pertaining to the amortization of stock option expense being reclassified to the share capital account as the related options were exercised during 2006 and $0.6 million related to the tax effect on the stock option and RSU expenses.
During fiscal 2005, a net total of $51.1 million was added to contributed surplus, of which $17.5 million related to the change in accounting for stock-based compensation (note 1(o)), $34.0 million and $8.1 million related to the amortization of stock option expense and RSU expense, respectively, and $0.4 million related to the tax effect on the stock option expense. The above increase was partly offset by $7.2 million worth of RSUs granted to employees that were exchanged for common shares upon vesting of RSUs and $1.7 million pertaining to the amortization of stock option expense being reclassified to the share capital account as the related options were exercised during 2005.

The Company and other owners of CVRH have jointly and severally provided a guarantee for the mortgage payment on a building facility occupied by the Company. In the event that CVRH is unable to meet the underlying mortgage payment to the lender, the Company and other owners of CVRH will be jointly and severally responsible under this guarantee.
In addition, the Company posted a letter of credit in the amount of $2.7 million (Cdn. $3.0 million) in favour of CVRH. CVRH has assigned this letter of credit to the exclusive benefit of the lender as additional security of the mortgage. The letter of credit has a term of five years and will expire on November 5, 2007. In the event of a lease default by the Company, the proceeds of the letter of credit will be paid to the lender.

The individuals named in the notice, other than Mr. K. Y. Ho, the then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and his wife, also entered into settlement agreements with the OSC. In October 2005, a panel of three commissioners of the OSC dismissed all allegations of insider trading against Mr. Ho and his wife. The panel's decision completely exonerated Mr. Ho and his wife. The decision was made following a hearing which was held by the OSC panel in the spring of 2005.

The Company estimates the fair value of the options at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed-form option pricing model and amortizes that value to expense over the options' vesting periods. The Company treats grants with graded vesting as a series of awards. The weighted average estimated fair value at the date of grant for the stock options granted within the year ended August 31, 2006 was $7.46 per share (2005 - $8.04; 2004 - $8.96). The weighted average assumptions used to determine the fair value, with respect to risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected life, are the same as those under the Canadian GAAP (note 12(c)(iii)).

In June 2005, the Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. The statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods' consolidated financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless to do so is impracticable. It is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after June 1, 2005. The Company does not expect the effect of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions. This is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("FIN 48"). Under FIN 48, an entity should presume that a taxing authority will examine a tax position when evaluating the position for recognition and measurement; therefore, assessment of the probability of the risk of examination is not appropriate. This standard is effective for the Company's 2008 fiscal year. The Company is assessing the impact of the new standard.
 
 
In August 2004, American Video Graphics LP ("AVG") filed a series of lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The lawsuits alleged infringement of several patents by various PC manufacturers, game console manufacturers and game publishers resulting from graphics and graphics processing functionality. Reconfiguration of these suits resulted in a total of six suits. Of these six suits, there were two suits pending against the entire group of PC manufacturers (the "PC Makers Suits") and two suits pending against the entire group of game console manufacturers (the "Game Console Suits").

The Company voluntarily intervened in the PC Makers Suits and the Game Console Suits. Two other suppliers of graphic processors also intervened: Intel Corporation ("Intel") voluntarily intervened in the PC Makers Suits and Nvidia Corporation ("Nvidia") voluntarily intervened in the PC Makers Suits and Game Console Suits (the Company, Intel and Nvidia are collectively referred to as the "Intervenors").
In January 2006, a definitive settlement agreement was approved by the Court and entered into by substantially all of the parties (including defendants and Intervenors) involved in the PC Makers Suits and Game Console Suits and AVG (two parties, unrelated to the Company, are not part of the definitive agreement and, consequently, claims relating solely to these two entities did survive). As part of the settlement agreement, the Company made a settlement payment of approximately $8.6 million to AVG. In exchange for the settlement payment from the Company and a confidential sum of monies payable to AVG by the defendants and other Intervenors, the settlement provided, in part: (i) all pending claims and suits were dismissed with prejudice against the settling defendants and Intervenors; (ii) a license to the entirety of the AVG patent portfolio (which includes, but is not limited to, the patents in the suits) were granted to the Company and customers and users of all of the Company's products; and (iii) a full and complete waiver of any claim for indemnification that any defendant or Intervenor may have had against any other settling party. Additionally, AVG was entitled to pursue further action against those parties not involved in these suits involving products that do not incorporate graphics processors from the Intervenors (e.g. non-Intervenor graphics processor suppliers).

In August and September 2005, five class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Company and certain of its directors and officers on behalf of shareholders who purchased the Company's common shares between October 7, 2004 and on or about June 23, 2005. The claims alleged that the Company and certain of its directors and officers violated U.S. securities law by failing to disclose material facts and making statements that contained misrepresentations about its business and future outlook. It is alleged that as a result of the failure to disclose material facts and the alleged misrepresentations, the Company's stock traded at artificially inflated prices until the stock price dropped on the news of its third quarter results in June of 2005. The claims further allege that, while in possession of material undisclosed information, certain directors and officers sold a portion of their common shares at inflated prices. On May 23, 2006, the Court dismissed one of the five actions because the plaintiff failed to serve the summons and complaint. On June 29, 2006, the Court consolidated the four remaining actions, designated the lead plaintiffs and approved the selection of the lead plaintiffs' counsel as lead counsel. On September 28, 2006, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The defendants' response to the consolidated amended complaint is due November 27, 2006.
The Company currently believes the amount of the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to the U.S. securities class action lawsuits will not materially affect its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company and the named directors and officers intend to defend themselves vigorously. However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and should any of these actions or proceedings against the Company be successful, the Company may be subject to significant damages awards which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position.

In August 2005, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Santa Clara by an alleged shareholder purporting to act on behalf of the Company. The defendants to the complaint included certain members of the Board of Directors and certain officers, and the Company itself as nominal defendant. The complaint alleged violations of California law, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and violation of California Corporations Code sections regarding insider trading, during the period between October 2004 and June 2005, based on allegations of inaccurate disclosures and improper trading activity, which allegations were essentially identical to the allegations in the securities class actions noted above. In January 2006, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that contained the same claims and allegations. The Company and certain directors and officers then responded with motions to dismiss the claims based on the requirements of Canadian law and the inconvenience of the California forum. On February 24, 2006, the Court entered an order dismissing six of the seven causes of action with prejudice, which resulted in dismissal of seven of the nine individual defendants. Accordingly, one claim remained in the case, against two defendants for alleged violation of the California insider trading statute. On March 13, 2006, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the outstanding cause of action on the grounds that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the presuit demand pleading requirements under California law, and additional motions were filed seeking dismissal of the remaining claim against one of the remaining defendants on other grounds. On April 20, 2006, the plaintiff filed a request for dismissal with prejudice of the entire action, which was entered by the Court that same day, dismissing the case in its entirety.
 
On July 24, 2006, it was publicly announced that AMD, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and the Company had entered into an acquisition agreement pursuant to which AMD had agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of the Company for a combination of approximately $4.2 billion in cash and 57 million shares of AMD common stock.
The transaction was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each company. The transaction was subject to the approval by the Company's shareholders, Canadian Court supervision of a Plan of Arrangement and other regulatory approvals, including merger notification filings in the United States, Canada and other jurisdictions, as well as customary closing conditions.

On October 13, 2006, at the Special Meeting of Shareholders called to approve the Plan of Arrangement relating to the proposed acquisition of the Company by AMD, the shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the proposed acquisition.
The Company obtained final Court approval for the arrangement on October 17, 2006. All other closing conditions have been satisfied. The transaction was completed on October 24, 2006 and became effective as of 12:01 a.m. on October 25, 2006. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's stock-based compensation plans, all the outstanding stock options and RSUs of the Company were converted into equivalent numbers of AMD stock options and RSUs in October 2006, as a result of a change of control of the Company.
The Company assessed what, if any, impact the above noted transaction would have on the financial statements, including the impact on future demand and budgeting and the implications to inventory obsolescence and goodwill impairment testing. No adjustment has been made to the financial statements to reflect the impact of a change in control for stock options and income taxes.
Upon closing of the transaction on October 24, 2006, the Company was obligated to pay an advisory fee of $20.05 million to Credit Suisse First Boston.

Exhibit 99.2
On July 23, 2006, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD" or the "Company") and ATI Technologies, Inc. ("ATI") entered into an acquisition agreement pursuant to which AMD agreed to acquire all of the outstanding ATI common stock for a combination of cash and shares of AMD common stock (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition was closed on October 24, 2006. The aggregate consideration paid by AMD for all outstanding ATI common shares consisted of approximately $4.26 billion of cash and 57.95 million shares of AMD common stock. Under the agreement, AMD also assumed substantially all issued and outstanding ATI stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards as of October 24, 2006 in exchange for comparable AMD stock-based awards. To finance a portion of the cash consideration paid, AMD borrowed $2.50 billion under a term loan (the "Debt Financing") with a third party financial institution. The total purchase price, including transaction costs of $25 million, was $5.61 billion.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of October 1, 2006 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 and the nine months ended October 1, 2006 are based on the historical financial statements of AMD and ATI after giving effect to (1) the Acquisition, (2) the Debt Financing and (3) the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
The pro forma information is being filed pursuant to the requirements of Item 2 and 9.01 of Form 8-K and Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X and is presented solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations or financial position that might have been achieved for the periods or dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company. The pro forma information does not reflect cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements expected to result from the Acquisition or the costs to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements. Income taxes reflect the assumption that certain U.S. tax elections will be made related to this Acquisition that will allow AMD to realize U.S. tax deductions from the amortization of acquired intangibles and goodwill. The pro forma adjustments and the allocation of the purchase price are based on AMD management's estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition.
The allocation of the purchase price is based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of ATI that existed as of October 24, 2006, the closing date of the Acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the Acquisition and the Debt Financing had been completed on October 1, 2006, the last day of AMD's third fiscal quarter and combines the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet of AMD at October 1, 2006 and the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet of ATI at August 31, 2006.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 and for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 are presented as if the Acquisition and the Debt Financing had been completed on December 27, 2004, the first day of AMD's fiscal 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 combines the historical results of AMD for the year ended December 25, 2005 and, due to ATI's different fiscal year end, the historical results of ATI for the 12-month period ended November 30, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended October 1, 2006
 
combines the historical unaudited results of AMD for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 and the historical unaudited results of ATI for the nine months ended August 31, 2006. ATI's historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which differs in certain respects from U.S. GAAP. AMD's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As described in Notes 5 and 6 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, ATI's historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to U.S. GAAP and certain additional conforming presentation adjustments have also been made to the financial statements of ATI to conform with AMD's presentation under U.S. GAAP. Unless stated otherwise, all dollar amounts are presented in U. S. dollars.
AMD may seek to refinance the Debt Financing. There is no guarantee that any or all of the Debt Financing can be refinanced at interest rates acceptable to AMD. There is currently no commitment to refinance the Debt Financing and, accordingly, the pro forma financial statements do not reflect the impact of such refinancing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Basis of Presentation
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of October 1, 2006 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 and the year ended December 25, 2005 are based on the historical financial statements of AMD and ATI after giving effect to (1) the Acquisition, (2) the Debt Financing and (3) the assumptions and adjustments described in these notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
The pro forma information is being filed pursuant to the requirements of Item 2 and 9.01 of Form 8-K and Rule 3-05 and Article 11 of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X and is presented solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the combined results of operations or financial position that might have been achieved for the periods or dates indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined company. The pro forma information is based on estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such information. It does not reflect cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements expected to result from the Acquisition or the costs to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies and revenue enhancements. Income taxes reflect the assumption that certain U.S. tax elections will be made related to the Acquisition that will allow AMD to realize U.S. tax deductions from the amortization of acquired intangibles and goodwill. The pro forma adjustments and the allocation of the consideration are based on AMD management's estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the Acquisition and the Debt Financing had been completed on October 1, 2006 and combines the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet of AMD at October 1, 2006 and the historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet of ATI at August 31, 2006. Since the final valuation of the ATI assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including net tangible and intangible assets, is as of the transaction closing date, October 24, 2006, those amounts actually recorded could differ from the amounts reflected in these pro forma financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 and for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 are presented as if the Acquisition and the Debt Financing had been completed on December 27, 2004, the first day of AMD's fiscal 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 combines the historical results of AMD for the year ended December 25, 2005 and, due to ATI's different fiscal year end, the historical results of ATI for the 12-month period ended November 30, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 combines the historical unaudited results of AMD for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 and the historical unaudited results of ATI for the six months ended August 31, 2006. ATI's historical consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP, which differs in certain respects from U.S. GAAP. AMD's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S.
 
GAAP. As described in Notes 5 and 6 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, ATI's historical consolidated financial statements were adjusted to U.S. GAAP and certain adjustments have also been made to the financial statements of ATI to conform with AMD's presentation under U.S. GAAP. Unless stated otherwise, all dollar amounts are presented in U.S. dollars.
2. The Acquisition
On July 23, 2006, AMD and ATI entered into an acquisition agreement pursuant to which AMD agreed to acquire all of the outstanding ATI common stock for a combination of cash and shares of AMD common stock. The Acquisition closed on October 24, 2006. The aggregate consideration paid by AMD for all outstanding ATI common shares consisted of $4.26 billion of cash and 57.95 million shares of AMD common stock. Under the agreement, AMD also assumed substantially all issued and outstanding ATI stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards as of October 24, 2006 in exchange for comparable AMD stock-based awards. To finance a portion of the cash consideration paid, AMD borrowed $2.50 billion under a term loan (the "Debt Financing") with a third party financial institution. The total purchase price, including transaction costs of $25 million, was $5.61 billion. The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The following table summarizes the components of the estimated total consideration determined for accounting purposes of these pro forma condensed combined financial statements (in thousands):
 
 
AMD financed the cash portion of the Acquisition with a combination of cash and debt. For the debt, AMD entered into a Credit Agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Collateral Agent, and other lenders that may become party thereto from time to time, pursuant to which AMD borrowed an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion under a term loan. Amounts borrowed under this Credit Agreement bear interest, in the case of base rate loans, at a rate equal to the "base rate," which is the higher of (i) the prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal and (ii) 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 1.25% margin, or in the case of Eurodollar loans, at a rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a 2.25% margin. Such margins will reduce by 0.25% when the outstanding aggregate principal amount under the Credit Agreement is less than $1.75 billion. As of October 24, 2006, the base rate was 8.25%, without the margin, and the Eurodollar Rate was 5.32%, without the margin. The amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in December 2006 and terminating in December 2013. The initial interest rate on the Term Loan, which is based on the Eurodollar Rate, is 7.57%.
The purchase consideration was allocated based on the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Acquisition. An allocation of the purchase price has been made to major categories of assets and liabilities in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements based on management's best estimates. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill.
The allocation of the purchase consideration based on a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date, is presented below (in thousands):
 
AMD reviewed the recorded book values of ATI's net assets acquired as of October 24, 2006 and believes that other than the inventory, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, the carrying amounts of these net assets acquired approximate their current fair values.
 
Inventory  Compared to the net book value of inventory as of October 24, 2006, there is a write-up adjustment of $92 million to record 1) finished goods at their estimated selling prices less estimated costs of disposal and a reasonable allowance for profit upon their sale, 2) work-in-process at their estimated selling prices less estimated costs to complete their manufacture and a reasonable allowance for profit for the remaining manufacturing and upon their sale, and 3) raw materials at their current replacement costs. Although, due to its non-recurring nature, the effect of the aggregate pro forma adjustment to the inventory's fair value is not included in the accompanying condensed combined statements of operations, the actual adjustment to be recorded will impact cost of sales during the approximate six-month period after the closing of the Acquisition, during which time the inventory on hand is expected to be sold.
Property, plant, and equipment  Compared to the net book value of property, plant and equipment as of October 24, 2006, the Company recorded a write-up adjustment of approximately $16.6 million. Approximately $7.4 million of the adjustment relates to land and the remaining portion relates to building and equipment which will be depreciated over an estimated average life of the related assets of two to ten years.
Identifiable intangible assets  Developed product technology comprises products that have reached technological feasibility, and includes technology in ATI's discrete products, integrated products, handheld products, and digital television products divisions. This intangible asset is expected to have an estimated useful life of five years. Game console royalty agreements represent existing agreements with video game console manufacturers for the payment of royalties to ATI for intellectual property design work performed, and are expected to have an average estimated useful life of five years. Customer relationship intangibles represent ATI's existing customer relationships and are expected to have an average estimated useful life of four years. Trademarks and trade names are expected to have an average estimated useful life of seven years. Customer backlog represents existing customer orders that have not been delivered and is expected to have an estimated useful life of fourteen months.
The fair value of intangible assets was based on a valuation conducted by AMD's management using income approaches to value and was based on management's latest financial forecast. The rates used to discount net cash flows to their present values ranged from 12% to 15%. These discount rates were determined after consideration of AMD's estimated weighted average cost of capital and the estimated internal rate of return specific to the Acquisition.
Estimated useful lives for the intangible assets were based on historical experience with technology life cycles, product roadmaps and AMD's intended future use of the intangible assets. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method, considering the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed.
In-process research and development  In-process research and development represents incomplete ATI research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use at the time of the Acquisition.
The fair value of in-process research and development was based on a valuation conducted by AMD's management using an income approach to value and was based on historical costs incurred and management's latest financial forecast. The discount rate used to discount net cash flows to their present values for the projects was 15%. This discount rate was estimated after consideration of AMD's estimated weighted average cost of capital, the estimated internal rate of return specific to this Acquisition, and the relative risk of the in-process development projects as compared to each of the identifiable intangible assets.
 
For pro forma financial statement purposes, in-process research and development costs are not included in the unaudited pro forma condensed statement of operations due to their non-recurring nature, but such costs will be expensed in AMD's consolidated financial statements as a charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess of the estimated purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually. In the event that AMD determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, AMD will incur a charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which such determination is made.
Pre-acquisition contingencies  If AMD identifies a material pre-acquisition contingency during the purchase price allocation period, which is generally up to one year after the closing of the Acquisition, AMD will attempt to determine its fair value and include it in the purchase price allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation period, AMD is unable to determine its fair value, AMD will apply FASB Statement No. 5, , and the amount, if any, determined by applying Statement 5 to such item will be included in the purchase price allocation.
Accounting for Contingencies
AMD received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division in connection with the DOJ's investigation into potential antitrust violations related to graphics processors and cards. AMD entered the graphics processor business following the company's acquisition of ATI Technologies, Inc. The DOJ has not made any specific allegations against AMD or ATI. AMD intends to cooperate with the investigation.
In connection with this Acquisition, AMD has also developed a plan to integrate the operations of both companies, which resulted in certain workforce reductions, anticipated duplicate facilities closures, and cancellation of certain existing contractual obligations. AMD believes the charges associated with this plan will not be material to its financial statements. Therefore these charges are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented.
3. Pro Forma Adjustments
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the Acquisition described in Note 2, as if it had occurred on October 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations give effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred on December 27, 2004, the first day of AMD's fiscal year ended December 25, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include any non-recurring charges that will arise as a result of the Acquisition described in Note 2.
Explanations of the adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of October 1, 2006 are as follows (in thousands):
(1) To eliminate ATI's existing goodwill and other intangibles, net
 
 
(2) To eliminate tax credits recoverable and certain deferred income taxes assets as they are determined unrealizable and to record additional income tax liabilities under AMD's tax structure
 
(3) To eliminate the stockholders' equity section of ATI
 
(4) To record the purchase consideration and the purchase price allocations based on their fair values. For pro forma purposes, the $415.6 million of purchased in-process research and development has been charged directly against retained earnings as such amount was not recorded in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 due to its non-recurring nature. However, the actual charge for in-process research and development will be expensed in AMD's consolidated statement of operations in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In addition, the impact of the fair value write-up of inventories has not been recorded in the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 due to its non-recurring nature. Such fair value write-up will have an adverse impact on the post-acquisition combined operations when the inventories are sold.
 
 
(5) To record debt issuance cost for the $2.5 billion term loan
 
Explanations of the adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 25, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):
(1) To eliminate the amortization expense of ATI's intangible assets.
 
(2) To eliminate ATI's stock-based compensation expense.
 
(3) To record the stock-based compensation expense for AMD's replacement stock options and restricted stock units.
 
(4) To record amortization expense associated with the various identified intangible assets. These intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from fourteen months to seven years.
 
 
(5) To record additional depreciation expense resulting from the fair value write-up of property, plant, and equipment. Such write-up is being depreciated over the related assets' estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. For pro forma presentation purposes, the entire amount has been charged to marketing, general and administrative expense.
 
(6) To record interest expense associated with the $2.5 billion debt to finance the transaction. The interest rate used is 7.57% which is based on the Eurodollar rate of 5.32% as of October 24, 2006, plus 2.25% margin. A 1/8% increase or decrease from this interest rate will result in approximately $3.125 million interest expense difference for the period.
 
(7) To record the amortization of debt issuance cost of $25 million over the seven-year term of the debt. The amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method.
 
(8) AMD has not recorded a tax benefit on the pro forma adjustments for the year ended December 25, 2005. There would be no incremental tax benefit from the pro forma adjustments as AMD recorded a full valuation allowance against its net U. S. deferred tax assets for this period. In addition, ATI's investment tax credit (ITC) and US research tax credit are eliminated as they are deemed not realizable under AMD's tax structure.
 
Explanations of the adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 are as follows (in thousands):
(1) To eliminate the amortization expense of ATI's intangible assets.
 
(2) To eliminate ATI's stock-based compensation expense.
 
 
(3) To record the stock-based compensation expense for AMD's replacement stock options and restricted stock units.
 
(4) To record amortization expense associated with the various identified intangible assets. These intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from fourteen months to seven years.
 
(5) To record additional depreciation expense resulting from the fair value write-up of property, plant, and equipment. Such write-up is being depreciated over the related assets' estimated useful lives, ranging from two to ten years. For pro forma presentation purposes, the entire amount has been charged to marketing, general and administrative expense.
 
(6) To record interest expense associated with the $2.5 billion debt to finance the transaction. The interest rate used is 7.57% which is based on the Eurodollar rate of 5.32% as of October 24, 2006, plus 2.25% margin. A 1/8% increase or decrease from this interest rate will result in approximately $2.344 million interest expense difference for the period.
 
(7) To record the amortization of estimated debt issuance costs of $25 million over the seven-year term of the debt. The expense is calculated on a straight line basis which approximates the effective interest method.
 
(8) To record the net income tax impact of the pro forma income statement adjustments. In addition, ATI's ITC and US research tax credit in the amount of $31,696 thousand are eliminated as they are deemed not realizable under AMD's tax structure.
 
 
4. Unaudited Pro Forma Income (Loss) Per Share
The following table sets forth the computation of shares used in deriving the unaudited pro forma basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands):
 
For the nine months ended October 1, 2006, the assumed conversion of AMD's 4.75% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2022 had an anti-dilutive effect and was, therefore, excluded from the historical AMD diluted share calculations. For the year ended December 25, 2005, potentially dilutive securities of approximately 66.3 million, including AMD options and restricted stock awards and the assumed exchanged AMD options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units for ATI options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units, were excluded from the pro forma per share calculations above, because of the pro forma net loss position of the year ended December 25, 2005. In addition, the assumed conversion of AMD's 4.50% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2007 and AMD's 4.75% Senior Convertible Debentures due 2022 was also excluded as these instruments are anti-dilutive in that period.
