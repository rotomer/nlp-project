Indenture
Exhibit 4.1
In connection with the pricing of the Notes, on April 24, 2007, the Company entered into a capped call transaction (the "") with respect to its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""), with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc., an affiliate of one of the Initial Purchasers (defined below). The Capped Call has an initial strike price of $28.08 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which matches the initial conversion price of the Notes, and a cap price of $42.12 per share. The Capped Call is intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes. If, however, the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call, there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of the Common Stock exceeds the cap price. The Company paid approximately $182 million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Call. A copy of the Capped Call is attached as to this Report, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Capped Call is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Capped Call.

Exhibit 10.2
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed that it will:
 
 
 
 
 
If the Company does not meet these deadlines then, subject to certain exceptions, additional interest will accrue on the Notes to be paid semi-annually in arrears at a rate per year equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of Notes to and including the 90
th
day following such registration default, or 0.50% of the principal amount thereafter, for the period during which the registration default is not cured. In no event will such additional interest accrue at a rate per year exceeding 0.50%.
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have performed various financial advisory, investment banking and commercial banking services from time to time for the Company and its affiliates and may do so in the future. Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, is an agent, and Merrill Lynch Capital Corp., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, is one of the lenders under the term loan that the Company entered into to finance the acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc.

As a result, Merrill Lynch Capital Corp. received a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc., an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc., is the counterparty in the Capped Call.
October 2006 Term Loan
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On April 27, 2007, the Company issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015. The Notes bear interest at 6.00% per annum. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year beginning November 1, 2007 until the maturity date of May 1, 2015.
Upon the occurrence of certain events described in the Indenture, the Notes will be convertible into cash up to the principal amount, and if applicable, Conversion Shares in respect of any conversion value above the principal amount, based on an initial conversion rate of 35.6125 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $28.08 per share. This initial conversion price represents a premium of 100% relative to the last reported sale price of AMD's common stock on April 23, 2007 (the trading date preceding the date of pricing of the Notes) of $14.04 per share. The conversion rate will be adjusted for certain anti-dilution events. In addition, the conversion rate will be increased in the case of corporate events that constitute a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) of the Company under certain circumstances. Holders of the Notes may require AMD to repurchase the Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) or a termination of trading (as defined in the Indenture).
 
The Notes rank equally with the Company's existing and future senior debt and senior to all of its future subordinated debt. The Notes rank junior to all of the Company's existing and future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.
The following events are considered "Events of Default," which may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the Notes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional information pertaining to the Notes is contained in Items 1.01 and 3.02 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
 
On April 27, 2007, the Company issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers received an aggregate commission of approximately $30.3 million in connection with the offering of the Notes.
The net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $2,169 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used approximately $182 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the Capped Call and paid $500 million of the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of the October 2006 Term Loan (see Item 1.01 above). The Company expects to use the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.
The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes and the Conversion Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The Company has entered into a Registration Rights Agreement for the resale by holders of the Notes and the Conversion Shares (see Item 1.01 above).
Additional information pertaining to the Notes is contained in Items 1.01 and 2.03 and is incorporated herein by reference.
This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
In a press release issued on April 27, 2007, the Company announced the closing of its previously announced offering of $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% of Convertible Senior Notes due 2015, including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their over-allotment option. The full text of the press release is attached hereto as and is incorporated herein by reference.

stolen Notes and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.

Every such temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee or such authenticating agent upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the Notes in certificated form. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee or such authenticating agent Notes in certificated form (other than in the case of Notes in global form) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes (other than any Global Note) may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 3.03 and the Trustee or such authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes in certificated form. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, such temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as Notes in certificated form authenticated and delivered hereunder.

The Trustee shall destroy canceled Notes in accordance with its customary procedures and, after such destruction, shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company, at the Company's written request. If the Company shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

In case one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(i) or Section 5.01(j) with respect to the Company), unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of at least twenty-five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Noteholders), may declare one hundred percent (100%) of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Interest, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

The Company shall notify the Responsible Officer of the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

st
) day), the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above.

In the event the Company does not elect to pay the Extension Fee upon an Event of Default in accordance with this paragraph, the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
In order to elect to pay the Extension Fee as the sole remedy during the first sixty (60) days after the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to the failure to comply with the reporting obligations in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company must (i) notify all Noteholders and the Trustee and Paying Agent of such election and pay such Extension Fee on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default occurs and (ii) pay such Extension Fee on or before the close of business on the date on which such Event of Default occurs.

Upon the failure to timely give such holders such notice or pay such Extension Fee, the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided above.
 
In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
Section 5.02In the event that the Trustee or the holders of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding hereunder have declared the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest) on, the Notes, to be due and payable immediately in accordance with Section 5.01, and the Company shall have failed forthwith to pay such amounts, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, after being furnished suitable indemnity pursuant to Section 6.01, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid (including such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities incurred by the Trustee hereunder other than through its negligence or bad faith), and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final degree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.

) Scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Purchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in Section 13.01(e). The Company shall give notice in writing to all record Noteholders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than thirty (30) Scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event.
In the case of clause (c) or (d) above, if the transaction is not consummated or the event does not occur, from and after the time of the Company's announcement that the transaction or event will not be consummated or occur, as the case may be, the Notes which have not theretofore been tendered for conversion shall cease to be convertible by virtue of such transaction or event.
(e)(i) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below. Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this Section 13.01(e) shall be settled pursuant to Section 13.02(d) below. For purposes of this Section 13.01(e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection" with a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in Section 13.01(d) (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) or (c) of this Section 13.01 shall apply to such conversion).
Additional Shares
(ii) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by reference to the table attached as hereto, based on the date on which the
Schedule A
 
Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the ""), and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the applicable table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the applicable table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates set forth in such table, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; that if (1) the Stock Price is greater than $150.00, per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate and (2) the Stock Price is less than $14.04 per share, (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the additional number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 35.6125 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04).
Effective Date
provided
provided further
(iii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of each table in hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.04 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).
Schedule A
Section 13.02
. Conversion Procedure.
(a) Subject to Section 13.02(b), the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third (3
rd
) Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the thirty (30) Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (k) below. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
 
(b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.01(e) pursuant to this clause (b).
(i)(A) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is prior to the third (3
rd
) Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.02(b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock, if any (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.01(e)), on the third (3
rd
) Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to be paid to holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
(B) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is on or following the third (3
rd
) Scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.01(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 13.01(e) above) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third (3
rd
) Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
(c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i) and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (A)
 
complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i), and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 13.02(c).
Notice of Conversion
Conversion Date
No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be tendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also tendered a Designated Event Purchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Purchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.01, as the case may be.
If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in Section 13.02(a), except to the extent specified in Section 13.02(b). The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Conversion Agent or to the holder of the Note surrendered for conversion, or such holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to the Conversion Agent or to such holder, or such holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
(e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.
 
(f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
(g) Except as provided in Section 13.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article 13.
(h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
(i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a record date and prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest (including any Additional Interest) payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any regular record date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest (including any Additional Interest) payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; (ii) in respect of any conversion that occurs after the record date immediately preceding the applicable Maturity Date; or (iii) to the extent of any overdue interest (including any Additional Interest) existing at
provided
however
 
the time of conversion with respect to such Note. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Notes.
(j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; , , that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided
however
(k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
Section 13.03
. Exchange in Lieu of Conversion.
(a) If at any time when a holder surrenders Notes for conversion prior to their Maturity Date and the Company:
(i) has designated a financial institution (a "") to accept such Notes in exchange for cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the consideration due upon conversion as provided in Section 13.02; and
Designated Institution
(ii) notifies the holder surrendering such Notes for conversion by the close of business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the start of the Observation Period, that it has directed the Designated Institution to exchange such Notes,
 
then, notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to the contrary, the Company may direct the Conversion Agent to surrender such Notes, on or prior to the commencement of the Observation Period to the Designated Institution for exchange.
(b) If the Designated Institution accepts Notes surrendered for conversion, it shall notify the Conversion Agent whether it shall deliver, upon exchange, cash and, if applicable, the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock, as specified in Section 13.02 to the Conversion Agent and the Conversion Agent shall deliver the cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, to the holder, within the time period specified in Section 13.02, which delivery shall be deemed to satisfy the Company's Conversion Obligation under this Article 13 with respect to such holder. Any Notes so exchanged by such Designated Institution shall remain outstanding for all purposes under this Indenture.
(c) If the Designated Institution agrees to accept any Notes for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration to the Conversion Agent, or if the Designated Institution does not accept such Notes for exchange, the Company shall, within the time period specified in Section 13.02, convert such Notes into cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.02.
(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Company's designation of a financial institution pursuant to this Section 13.03 require such financial institution to accept any Notes for exchange. The Company hereby agrees not to pay any consideration to, or otherwise enter into any agreement with, any Designated Institution with respect to its designation pursuant to this Section 13.03.
Section 13.04The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
. Adjustment of Conversion Rate.
(a) If the Company issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
 
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Record Date fixed for such dividend or distribution or the date fixed for such share split or share combination. To the extent any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, split or share combination had not been declared.
(b) If the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
 
 
 
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination of Noteholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants. If such rights or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) If the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company excluding (i) dividend or distribution rights or warrants referred to in Section 13.04(a) or 13.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and (iii) Spin-Offs described below in this Section 13.04 (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 13.04(c) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP
provided
0
as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP
0
above.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before close of business after the tenth
Spin-Off
 
(10
th
) Trading Day immediately following, and including the effective date of the Spin-Off will be increased based on the following formula:
where
 
 
 
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth (10
th
) Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten (10) Trading Days following the effective date of any Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to ten (10) Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
provided
(d) If the Company pays a dividend or makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where,
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the close of business, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP
provided
0
as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 13.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 13.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where
 
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected.
(f) In the event of an increase in the Conversion Rate pursuant to clauses (c) through (e) of this Section 13.04 or Section 13.01(e), that would result in the Notes, in the aggregate, becoming convertible into shares of Common Stock in excess of the limitation set forth in Section 312.03(c) of the Listed Company Manual of the New York Stock Exchange, or a successor to such rule, as may then be in effect and interpreted by the New York Stock Exchange, the Company shall, at its option, either obtain stockholder approval of such issuances or deliver cash in lieu of any shares otherwise deliverable upon conversions in excess of such limitations (based on the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately prior to the date when such shares would otherwise be required to be distributed).
 
(g) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) above and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
(iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
(v) for accrued and unpaid interest (including any Additional Interest).
To the extent the Notes become convertible into cash, assets or property (other than Capital Stock of the Company or securities to which Section 13.01(e) applies), no adjustment shall be made thereafter as to the cash, assets or property. Interest shall not accrue on such cash, assets or property.
(h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 13 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 13.04. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least one percent (1%) in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than one percent (1%) of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than one percent (1%), upon conversion, a Designated Event, a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity. If the application of the foregoing formulae in Section 13.04(a) through (e) (other than as a result of a share split or share combination) would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made.
 
(i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officer's Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.07 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(j) Any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a Record Date for a dividend or distribution described in Section 13.04(a), Section 13.04(c), or Section 13.04(d), (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution, or effective date of a share split or combination pursuant to Section 13.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 13.04(b), or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 13.04(e) (each an ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Note converted after such Adjustment Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the amounts deliverable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 13.02(k). For purposes of this Section 13.04(j), the term "" shall mean:
Adjustment Determination Date
Adjustment Event
(i) in any case referred to in clause (1) and (2) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
(ii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
 
(iii) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
(k) For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
(l) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Notes prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
Section 13.05The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
. Shares to Be Fully Paid.
Section 13.06
. Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale.
In the event of (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to another Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a ""), then:
Merger Event
(a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01(b) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 13 and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation
 
and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the purchase rights set forth in Article 14 herein.
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 13.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officer's Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 13.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed to a right to convert such Note by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Noteholder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Notes into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 13.02(b). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 hereof prior to the effective date.
Reference Property
(c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at his address appearing on the Note register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
 
(d) The above provisions of this Section 13.06 shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
Section 13.07Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate. The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
. Certain Covenants.
Section 13.08Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
. Responsibility of Trustee.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 13.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officer's Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
 
Section 13.09
. Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions.
In case:
(a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.04;
(b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all or substantially all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.04;
(c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company,
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Noteholder at his address appearing on the Note register, provided for in Section 2.07 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty (20) days prior to the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below, as the case may be, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
Section 13.10To the extent the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Notes, the holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the associated rights issued under such rights plan unless, prior to conversion, the
. Shareholder Rights Plans.
 
rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of Common Stock shares of the Company's Capital Stock, evidences of Indebtedness or assets as described in Section 13.04(c) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend such applicable rights plan to provide that upon conversion of the Notes the holders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the rights which would have attached to such Common Stock if the rights had not become separated from the Common Stock under such applicable rights plan.

The Additional Interest Amount shall accrue from the first day of the applicable Registration Default Period, and shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date during the Registration Default Period (and on the Interest Payment Date next succeeding the end of the Registration Default Period if the Registration Default Period does not end on a Interest Payment Date) to the Record Holders of
 
the Registrable Securities entitled thereto; that any Additional Interest Amount accrued with respect to any Security or portion thereof redeemed by the Company on a redemption date, purchased by the Company on a repurchase date or converted into Underlying Common Stock on a conversion date prior to the Interest Payment Date, shall, in any such event, be paid instead to the Holder who submitted such Security or portion thereof for redemption, purchase or conversion on the applicable redemption date, repurchase date or conversion date, as the case may be, on such date (or promptly following the conversion date, in the case of conversion), unless the redemption date or the repurchase date, as the case may be, falls after the Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; and , that, in the case of a Registration Default of the type described in clause (iii), (iv) or (v) of the first paragraph of this Section 2(f) such Additional Interest Amount shall be paid only to the Holders entitled thereto by check mailed to the address set forth in the Notice and Questionnaire delivered by such Holder.

Section 6
.
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Notice Holder, each person, if any, who controls any Notice Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each affiliate of any Notice Holder within the meaning of Rule 405 under the
 
Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Shelf Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus prepared by it or authorized by it in writing for use by such Notice Holder (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Notice Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Notice Holder expressly for use therein; that the foregoing indemnity shall not inure to the benefit of any Notice Holder (or to the benefit of any person controlling such Notice Holder) from whom the person asserting such losses, claims or liabilities purchased the Registrable Securities, if a copy of the Prospectus or the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (both as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Notice Holder to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities to such person, and if the Prospectus or the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (both as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, unless such failure is the result of noncompliance by the Company with Section 2(b) hereof.
provided
(b) Each Notice Holder agrees severally and not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors, its officers who sign any Shelf Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) or any other Notice Holder, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Notice Holder, but only with reference to information relating to such Notice Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Notice Holder expressly for use in such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto. In no event shall the liability of any Notice Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such Notice Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement giving rise to such indemnification obligation.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b) hereof, such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be
indemnified party
 
sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a), the Holders of a majority (with Holders of Securities deemed to be the Holders, for purposes of determining such majority, of the number of shares of Underlying Common Stock into which such Securities are or would be convertible as of the date on which such designation is made) of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement held by Holders that are indemnified parties pursuant to Section 6(a) and, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b), the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
indemnifying party
(d) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable
 
law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the initial placement pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (before deducting expenses) of the Registrable Securities to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate. The relative benefits received by any Holder shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving registration rights under this Agreement for the Registrable Securities. The relative fault of the Holders on the one hand and the Company on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Holders or by the Company, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6(d) are several in proportion to the respective number of Registrable Securities they have sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, and not joint.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding this Section 6(d), no indemnifying party that is a selling Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Registrable Securities sold by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
(e) The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity, hereunder, under the Purchase Agreement or otherwise.
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any
 
termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder, any person controlling any Holder or any affiliate of any Holder or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) the sale of any Registrable Securities by any Holder pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement.
The Company covenants that, if at any time before the end of the Effectiveness Period, the Company is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, it will cooperate with any Holder and take such further reasonable action as any Holder may reasonably request in writing (including, without limitation, making such reasonable representations as any such Holder may reasonably request), all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the Securities Act and customarily taken in connection with sales pursuant to such exemptions. Upon the written request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such filing requirements, unless such a statement has been included in the Company's most recent report filed pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities (other than the Common Stock) under the Exchange Act.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold by such Holders pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement; that the

Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent or thereafter shall be bound by any such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent effected pursuant to this Section 8(b) whether or not any notice, writing or marking indicating such amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent appears on the Registrable Securities or is delivered to such Holder.

Exhibit 99.1
News Release
 
 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) today announced the closing of its offering of $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015, including $200 million of notes that were issued in connection with the exercise in full of the initial purchasers' over-allotment option. The notes were privately offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
SUNNYVALE, Calif, April 27, 2007
In connection with the offering, AMD entered into capped call transactions with an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers. The capped call transactions are intended to reduce the potential dilution to AMD's stockholders upon any future conversion of the notes. The capped call transaction effectively will increase the conversion price of the convertible notes to $42.12 per share of AMD's common stock, representing a 300% premium relative to the last reported sale price of $14.04 per share of the common stock on April 23, 2007.
AMD estimates that the net proceeds from the offering, will be approximately $2,169 million, after deducting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. AMD used approximately $182 million of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cost of the capped call transactions. AMD used $500 million of the remaining net proceeds to repay a portion of the term loan AMD entered into with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. to finance a portion of the purchase price of, and expenses related to, the acquisition of ATI Technologies Inc. AMD will use the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.
This press release is neither an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes nor shall there be any sale of the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification thereof under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offers of the notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The notes and AMD's common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current preliminary expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Information on potential risk factors that could affect AMD, its business and its financial results are detailed in the company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, but not limited to, those risks and uncertainties listed in the section entitled "Risk Factors," which can be found in AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2007.
