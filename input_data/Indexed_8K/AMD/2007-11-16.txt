The arbitrators shall have the power to grant temporary, preliminary and permanent relief, including, without limitation, injunctive relief and specific performance. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrators pursuant to the terms hereof, the arbitrators' expenses shall be shared equally by the Company, on the one hand, and the Investor on the other hand. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto (i) submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of England located in London, England over any suit, action or proceeding with respect to enforcement of any arbitral award or decision rendered in accordance with the foregoing provisions and (ii) waives any objection that it may have to the venue of any suit, action or proceeding with respect to enforcement of any arbitral award or decision rendered in accordance with the foregoing provisions in the courts of England located in London, England.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Investor hereby irrevocably waives any claim to sovereign immunity in regard to any judicial proceedings ancillary to an arbitration hereunder, including, without limitation, immunity from any judicial proceeding to compel arbitration, for interim relief in and of arbitration, or to enforce any arbitral award, immunity from service of process, immunity from jurisdiction of any court, and immunity of any of its property from execution.
(c) The parties hereto agree that the process by which any arbitral or other proceedings ("proceedings") in England are begun may be served on them by being delivered to Law Debenture Corporate Services Limited or their registered offices for the time being and by giving notice in accordance with Section 8.02. If Law Debenture Corporate Services Limited is not or ceases to be effectively appointed to accept service of process in England on any party's behalf, such party shall immediately appoint a further person in England to accept service of process on its behalf. If within 15 days of notice from a party requiring another party to appoint a person in England to accept service of process on its behalf the other party fails to do so, the party shall be entitled to appoint such a person by written notice to the other party. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of the parties to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
 
(d) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto consents generally in respect of any proceedings to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process in connection with such proceedings including, without limitation, the making, enforcement or execution against any property whatsoever, irrespective of its use or intended use, of any order or judgment which is made or given in such proceedings.
