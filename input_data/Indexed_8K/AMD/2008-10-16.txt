The information in this Report, including the Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 and Item 7.01 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. It may only be incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
On October 16, 2008, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") announced its financial position and results of operations as of and for its fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2008 in a press release that is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
To supplement the Company's financial results presented on a U.S. GAAP basis, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP gross margin and adjusted EBITDA.
To derive non-GAAP net income (loss) for the third fiscal quarter of 2008, the Company excluded the loss from discontinued operations, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration and other charges related to the Company's acquisition of ATI Technologies, Inc. ("ATI") which closed on October 24, 2006, and certain restructuring charges. To derive non-GAAP net income (loss) for the third fiscal quarter of 2007, the Company excluded the loss from discontinued operations, marketable securities' impairment charges and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration and other charges primarily related to the ATI acquisition. To derive non-GAAP net income (loss) for the second fiscal quarter of 2008, the Company excluded the loss from discontinued operations, the gain from the sale of certain 200mm equipment, marketable securities' impairment charges, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration and other charges related to the ATI acquisition and certain restructuring charges.
To derive non-GAAP operating income (loss) for the third fiscal quarter of 2008, the Company excluded the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration and other charges related to the ATI acquisition and certain restructuring charges. To derive non-GAAP operating income (loss) for the third fiscal quarter of 2007, the Company excluded the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration and other charges primarily related to the ATI acquisition. To derive non-GAAP operating income (loss) for the second fiscal quarter of 2008, the Company excluded the gain from the sale of certain 200mm equipment, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration and other charges related to the ATI acquisition and certain restructuring charges.
To derive non-GAAP gross margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2008, the Company excluded technology license revenue. To derive non-GAAP gross margin for the second fiscal quarter of 2008, the Company excluded the gain from the sale of certain 200mm equipment.
Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following:
: As part of the Company's strategy of evaluating the viability of its non-core business, the Company determined that its Handheld and DTV business units are not directly aligned with its computing and graphics opportunities. Therefore, the Company has decided to divest these business units and classify them as discontinued operations in the financial statements presented.
Discontinued operations
: The Company excluded the effect of this item from its GAAP gross margin for the third fiscal quarter of 2008, as $191 million is an unusually large amount of technology license revenue for one fiscal quarter.
Technology license revenue
: The Company recognized a gain of $193 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with sales of certain 200mm wafer fabrication tools which had a materially favorable impact on the Company's gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company excluded the effect of this item from its GAAP net loss, operating loss and gross margin as it is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.
Gain on sale of certain 200mm equipment
: For the second quarter of 2008, these charges consisted of a $24 million charge for the Company's investment in Spansion Inc. and a $12 million charge related to the Company's holdings in auction-rate securities. For the third quarter of 2007, these charges consisted of a $42 million charge for the Company's investment in Spansion Inc. The Company excluded the effect of this item from its GAAP net loss as it is not indicative of ongoing operating performance.
Marketable securities' impairment charges
: The Company incurred significant expenses in connection with the ATI acquisition, which it would not have otherwise incurred and which the Company believes are not indicative of ongoing performance. These primarily consisted of the amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and charges incurred in connection with integrating the two companies. In addition, for the third fiscal quarter of 2007, the Company excluded certain other charges, which consist of severance charges related to costs incurred for workforce reductions as a result of the Company's cost cutting efforts. The Company believes that the exclusion of these amounts enables investors to better evaluate its current operating performance compared with prior periods.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets, integration and other charges
: The restructuring charges relate to a restructuring plan implemented by the Company during the second fiscal quarter of 2008 to reduce its breakeven point. The plan primarily involves the termination of employees which commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2008. These restructuring charges represent primarily employee severance payments and also include costs related to the termination of a contract. For the third quarter of fiscal 2008, these restructuring charges totaled $9 million. The Company excluded the effect of this item from GAAP net income (loss) and operating income (loss) as it is not indicative of ongoing performance.
Restructuring charges
The Company's management believes this non-GAAP presentation will aid investors by presenting current and historical results in a form that makes it easier to compare current period operating results with historical operating results.
In addition, the Company presented "Adjusted EBITDA" in the financial schedules to the earnings release. In the financial schedules, Adjusted EBITDA was determined by adjusting income (loss) from continuing operations for depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, interest expense and taxes.
Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided reconciliations within the press release and financial schedules of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
The Company calculated and communicated Adjusted EBITDA in the financial schedules because the Company's management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds.
The Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP operating measure of net income (loss) or U.S. GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows.
Management does not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
On October 6, 2008, the Company entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the "Master Transaction Agreement") with Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC, a limited liability company established under the laws of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and wholly owned by the Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and West Coast Hitech L.P., an exempted limited partnership organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands, acting through its general partner, West Coast Hitech G.P., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Master Transaction Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

For so long as Pearl shall have the right to designate the Pearl Director Designee pursuant to this Section 9.01, Discovery shall, subject to applicable Law, cause the board of directors of Discovery (or a nominating committee thereof) to nominate the Pearl Director Designee to stand for election at any meeting of the stockholders (or pursuant to the solicitation of written consents in lieu

Discovery shall, subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable the Pearl Director Designee to be elected to the board of directors of Discovery.

Further Assurances
(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 9.03(a), Discovery agrees that, in the event that any consent, approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the benefit of FoundryCo any right or benefit under any lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement to which Discovery or any Subsidiary is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Discovery shall, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with FoundryCo in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, Discovery shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide FoundryCo with the rights and benefits of the affected lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement for the term of such lease, license, contract or other agreement or arrangement, and, if Discovery provides such rights and benefits, FoundryCo, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations and burdens thereunder.

In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party.

In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably submits to: (i) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England located in London, England in relation to any Interim Relief Proceeding and; (ii) the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England located in London, England with respect to the enforcement of any arbitral award rendered in accordance with this Section 14.09; and, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding, waives any objection that it may have to the courts of England located in London, England on the grounds of inconvenient forum.

(e) The Parties hereto agree that the process by which any arbitral or other proceedings in London, England are begun may be served on them by being delivered to Law Debenture Corporate Services Limited or their registered offices for the time being and by giving notice in accordance with Section 14.01. If Law Debenture Corporate Services Limited is not or ceases to be effectively appointed to accept service of process in England on any Party's behalf, such Party shall immediately appoint a further person in England to accept service of process on its behalf. If within fifteen (15) days of notice from a Party requiring another Party to appoint a person in England to accept service of process on its behalf the other Party fails to do so, the Party shall be entitled to appoint such a person by written notice to the other Party.

In the second quarter of 2008, AMD had revenue from continuing operations of $1.349 billion, a net loss of $1.189 billion, a loss from continuing operations of $269 million and an operating loss of $143 million. In the third quarter of 2007, AMD had revenue from continuing operations of $1.558 billion, a net loss of $396 million, a loss from continuing operations of $344 million and an operating loss of $181 million.
"We achieved a significant milestone with the recent announcement of our Asset Smart strategy, which will transform both AMD and the industry through the creation of The Foundry Company'," said Dirk Meyer, AMD's president and CEO. "AMD will be assured access to leading-edge manufacturing processes without the obligation to make the capital investment required to maintain a world-class manufacturing operation. We look forward to the successful closing of this joint venture early in 2009."
"We are pleased to have reached our goal of operational profitability this quarter while increasing gross margin to 51 percent," said Robert J. Rivet, AMD's chief financial officer. "Improved execution across all of our businesses was punctuated by a refresh of our graphics product line-up, driving 55 percent sequential revenue growth and market share gains. In addition, customer adoption of our quad-core microprocessors was strong, with unit shipments increasing 46 percent sequentially."
 
 
Third quarter 2008 gross margin was 51 percent, and 45 percent excluding process technology license revenue. This compares favorably to both the second quarter 2008 non-GAAP gross margin of 37 percent, and third quarter of 2007 gross margin of 41 percent.

Cautionary Statement
This release contains forward-looking statements concerning revenue and other expectations for the fourth quarter of 2008, the expected closing of The Foundry Company joint venture and the increased investment by the Mubadala Development Company which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as "would," "may," "expects," "believes," "plans," "intends," "projects," and other terms with similar meaning. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Risks include the possibility that Intel Corporation's pricing, marketing and rebating programs, product bundling, standard setting, new product introductions or other activities targeting the company's business will prevent attainment of the company's current plans; global business and economic conditions will worsen, resulting in lower than currently expected revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 and beyond; the company's Asset Smart strategy will not reach fruition or will be less beneficial than anticipated; the announced transaction for the formation of The Foundry Company and the associated third-party investment will not occur as anticipated; demand for computers and consumer electronics products and, in turn, demand for the company's products will be lower than currently expected; customers stop buying the company's products or materially reduce their demand for its products; the company will require additional funding and may not be able to raise funds on favorable terms or at all; the company's cost containment efforts will not be effective; the company will be unable to develop, launch and ramp new products and technologies in the volumes and mix required by the market and at mature yields on a timely basis; there will be unexpected variations in market growth and demand for the company's products and technologies in light of the product mix that it may have available at any particular time or a decline in demand;
 
 
the company will be unable to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies in a timely and effective way, consistent with planned capital expenditures; the company will be unable to maintain the level of investment in research and development and capacity that is required to remain competitive; the company will be unable to divest its Handheld or DTV product businesses in the expected timeframe, if at all, or in a manner contemplated by the company; and the company will be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity or components to meet demand for its products or will under-utilize its microprocessor manufacturing facilities. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 28, 2008.
