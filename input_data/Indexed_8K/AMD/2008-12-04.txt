(iii) As to the action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent, (A) a reasonably detailed description of the actions or actions, (B) the text of the proposal (including the text of any resolutions to be adopted by consent and the language of any proposed amendment to the bylaws of the Corporation), (C) the reasons for soliciting consents for the proposal and (D) a reasonably detailed description of any material interest in the proposal held by the Soliciting Person, including all agreements, arrangements and understandings (x) between or among any of the Soliciting Persons and (y) between or among any Soliciting Person and any other person or entity (including their names) in connection with the request or such action or actions.
 
(f) In connection with an action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent in accordance with this Section 10, the stockholder or stockholders seeking such action or actions shall further update and supplement the information previously provided to the Corporation in connection therewith, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided pursuant to this Section 10 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders eligible to take such action and as of the date that is five (5) business days prior to the date the consent solicitation is commenced, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) business days after the record date for determining the stockholders eligible to take such action (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than three (3) business days prior to the date that the consent solicitation is commenced (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of five (5) business days prior to the commencement of the consent solicitation).
(g) Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no action may be taken by the stockholders by written consent except in accordance with this Section 10. If the Board shall determine that any request to fix a record date or to take stockholder action by written consent was not properly made in accordance with this Section 10, or the stockholder or stockholders seeking to take such action do not otherwise comply with this Section 10, then the Board shall not be required to fix a record date and any such purported action by written consent shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to the requirements of this Section 10 with respect to stockholders seeking to take an action by written consent, each Soliciting Person shall comply with all requirements of applicable law, including all requirements of the Exchange Act, with respect to such action.
(h) Nothing contained in this Section 10 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any Consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the Secretary or the inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution, or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
Section 11. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of the Board or by another chair designated by the Board. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the chair of the meeting and announced at the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the chair of any meeting of stockholders shall have the exclusive right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chair, are
 
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chair of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chair of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof, and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the chair of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
Section 12. Any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be postponed, and any previously scheduled annual or special meeting of the stockholders called by the Board may be canceled, by resolution of the Board upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders. The Board in its discretion may set a new record date for the postponed meeting.
Section 13. The Board may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspector's count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. The results of any election at which inspectors are appointed shall not be deemed final and effective until the receipt and approval by the Board of the inspectors' certification and report.
 
Section 1. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be not less than three (3) nor more than eleven (11). Within the limits above specified, the number of directors shall be determined by resolution of the Board or by the stockholders at the annual meeting. Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, the directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders in the manner provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Section 1. Directors need not be stockholders.
(a) Each director to be elected by the stockholders of the Corporation shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director by the shares represented and entitled to vote therefor at a meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present (an "Election Meeting"); that if the Board determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting (a "Contested Election"), and the Board has not rescinded such determination by the date that is twenty (20) days prior to the date of the Election Meeting as initially announced, each of the directors to be elected at the Election Meeting shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented and entitled to vote at such meeting with respect to the election of such director. For purposes of this Section 1, a "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of votes cast "for" a candidate for director exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director. In an election other than a Contested Election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast votes "for" or "against" the election of directors or to "abstain" from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors. In a Contested Election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast "for" or "withhold" votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors.
provided, however,
(b) In the event one or more incumbent directors fails to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at an Election Meeting at which there was no Contested Election (each, a "Subject Director"), either (i) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or (ii) if one or more of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is a Subject Director or the Board determines that any decision to be made with respect to a Subject Director should be made by a
 
committee other than the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a committee consisting solely of independent directors (as determined in accordance with applicable NYSE rules and listing requirements and any additional criteria set forth in the Corporation's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter) who are not Subject Directors or (iii) if all independent directors are Subject Directors, the entire board (the committee or board described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence, the "Committee") will make a determination as to whether to accept or reject any previously tendered Resignations (as defined below), or whether other action should be taken (including whether to request that a Subject Director resign from the Board if no Resignation had been tendered prior to the relevant Election Meeting). The Committee will act with respect to any Subject Directors within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results and shall notify the Subject Directors of its decision. The Committee may consider all factors it considers relevant, including any stated reasons for "against" votes, whether the underlying cause or causes of the "against" votes are curable, the factors, if any, set forth in the Corporation's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter or other policies that are to be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in evaluating potential candidates for the Board as such criteria relate to each Subject Director, the length of service of each Subject Director and each Subject Director's contributions to the Corporation. Subject Directors shall not participate in the deliberation or decision(s) of the Committee. The Corporation shall publicly disclose the decision(s) of the Committee in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of a Current Report on Form 8-K. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the result of accepting all tendered Resignations then pending and requesting resignations from incumbent directors who did not submit a Resignation prior to the relevant Election Meeting, would be that the corporation would have fewer than three directors who were in office before the election of directors, the Committee may determine to extend such ninety (90-) day period by an additional ninety (90) days if it determines that such an extension is in the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders. For purposes of this Section 1, a "Resignation" is an irrevocable resignation submitted by an incumbent director nominated for re-election prior to the relevant Election Meeting that will become effective upon the occurrence of both (i) the failure to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at an Election Meeting at which there was no Contested Election and (ii) acceptance of such resignation by the Committee.
(c) If a Subject Director's tendered Resignation is not accepted by the Committee or such Subject Director does not otherwise submit his or her resignation to the Board, such director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a Subject Director's resignation is accepted by the Committee pursuant
 
to this Section 1, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 2 of these Bylaws.
Section 2. Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office.
Section 3. The business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 4. The provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of this Article II are subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of any series of the Preferred Stock of the Corporation with respect to the election of directors in the event the Corporation defaults in the payment of dividends, the term of office of any director so elected and the filling of a vacancy in the office of any director so elected.
Section 5. The Board may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.
Section 6. The first meeting of each newly elected Board shall be held at such time and place as the Board shall determine.
Section 7. Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board.
 
Section 8. Special meetings of the Board may be called by the Chairman, the President, or the Secretary. A special meeting of the Board shall be called by the President or the Secretary upon the written request of at least two directors. Notice of a special meeting of the Board shall be given in writing, by telephone, telegraph, facsimile or e-mail, or in person, as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. Notice shall be deemed valid if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the director at the director's address as it appears in the records of the Corporation, not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, or if sent by telephone, telegram, facsimile or e-mail not less than twenty-four (24) hours before the date of the meeting to the director in accordance with the information for such communications as it appears in the records of the Corporation.
Section 9. At all meetings of the Board, the Directors entitled to cast a majority of the votes of the whole Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the Directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board, the Directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
Section 10. Member of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 10 shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.
Section 11. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
Section 12. The Board may, in the manner provided by law, designate one or more committees of the board. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the enabling resolution and permitted by applicable law, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to
 
be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided that in the absence or disqualification of any member of such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as they may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board.
Section 13. Meetings of a committee of the Board may be called by any member of the committee upon notice thereof given to each member either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the meeting, by electronic transmission, telephone or telegram on twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. Except as may be otherwise specifically provided by the Board, at all committee meetings a majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the members voting at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the committee; if a quorum shall not be present at any committee meeting the members present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present. Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board when required.
Section 14. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board and may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation thereof. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Section 1. Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice, but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director or stockholder, at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the U.S. mail. Notice to directors may also be given by telephone, telegram or other means of electronic transmission.
 
Section 2. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
Section 1. The officers of the Corporation shall be chosen by the Board and shall be a chief executive officer, a president, a vice president, a secretary and a treasurer. The Board may also choose additional vice presidents, and one or more assistant secretaries and assistant treasurers. Any number of offices may be held by the same person, unless the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws otherwise provide.
Section 2. The Board at its first meeting after each annual meeting of stockholders shall choose a Chairman of the Board, a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary and a treasurer.
Section 3. The Board may appoint such other officers and agents as it shall deem necessary who shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined from time to time by the board.
Section 4. The salaries of all officers and agents of the Corporation shall be fixed by the Board, or by the officers under authority granted by the Board.
Section 5. The officers of the Corporation shall hold office until their successors are chosen and qualify. Any officer elected or appointed by the Board may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation may only be filled by the Board.
Section 6. The Chairman of the Board shall preside at meetings of the stockholders and directors, lead the board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee the performance of the Corporation and perform such other duties as the Board shall prescribe. The Chairman of the Board may be, upon the decision of the Board, an executive officer of the Corporation and receive such compensation as the Board shall determine.
 
Section 7. The chief executive officer of the Corporation shall have the executive responsibility for the general and active management of the business of the Corporation. If there is no chairman of the board or during the absence or disability of the chairman of the board, he shall exercise all of the powers and discharge all of the duties of the chairman of the board. He shall possess power to sign all certificates, contracts and other instruments of the Corporation. He shall, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, preside at all meetings of the stockholders and the Board. He shall perform all other such duties as the Board shall prescribe.
Section 8. The president of the Corporation shall possess power to sign all certificates, contracts and other instruments of the Corporation, except as otherwise limited by the chief executive officer of the Corporation. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the president may, in the absence of the chief executive officer, perform duties and exercise the powers of the chief executive officer. He shall perform all such other duties as are incident to his office or are properly required of him by the Board.
Section 9. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, each vice president may, in the absence of the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer and president, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the president. Each vice president shall at all times possess power to sign all certificates, contracts and other instruments of the Corporation, except as otherwise limited in writing by the chief executive officer or the president of the Corporation, and shall have such other authority and perform such other duties as these bylaws or the Board, executive committee, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, or president shall prescribe.
Section 10. The secretary shall attend all meetings of the Board and all meetings of the stockholders and record all the proceedings of the meetings of the Corporation and of the Board in a book to be kept for that purpose and shall perform like duties for the standing committees when required.

He shall have custody of the corporate seal of the Corporation and he, or an assistant secretary, shall have authority to affix the same to any instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by his signature or by the signature of such assistant secretary. The Board may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest the affixing by his signature.
 
Section 11. The assistant secretary, or if there be more than one, the assistant secretaries in the order determined by the Board (or if there be no such determination, then in the order of their election), shall, in the absence of the secretary or in the event of his inability or refusal to act, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the secretary and shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board may from time to time prescribe.

Section 14. If required by the Board, he shall give the Corporation a bond (which shall be renewed every six (6) years) in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the Board for the faithful performance of the duties of his office and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of his death, resignation, retirement or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in his possession or under his control belonging to the Corporation.
Section 15. The assistant treasurer, or if there shall be more than one, the assistant treasurers in the order determined by the Board (or if there be no such determination, then in the order of their election), shall, in the absence of the treasurer or in the event of his inability or refusal to act, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the treasurer and shall perform such other duties and have such powers as the Board may from time to time prescribe.
Section 1. The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the shares of stock of the Corporation may also be represented by uncertificated shares evidenced by a book-entry system maintained by the registrar of such stock. Every holder of stock in the

Section 3. The Board may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Section 4. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer agent of the Corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the Corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
Section 5. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of
 
stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, and (ii) in the case of any other lawful action other than stockholder action by written consent, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed by the Board: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the next day preceding the day on which the meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than stockholder action by written consent) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
provided, however,
Section 6. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
Section 1. Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 2. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
 
Section 3. The Board shall present at each annual meeting, and at any special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the stockholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the Corporation.

Section 1. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) (a "third party proceeding") by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (an "indemnitee"), against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Section 2. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor (together with third party proceedings, "proceedings") by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (an "indemnitee"), against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 3. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to such actions, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, (iii) if there are no such directors or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding, described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 4. If a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Article VIII is not paid in full within thirty (30) days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnitee has been received by the Corporation, the Indemnitee may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim, including attorneys fees and costs, to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the
 
Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the exclusive forum for any litigation by the Indemnitee and the Corporation over any aspect of the Indemnitee's rights to indemnification or advancements.
Section 5. Expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 6. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of Delaware law or otherwise. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.
Section 7. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or employee of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII, or otherwise under Delaware law.
 
Section 8. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers or employees, so that any person who is or was a director, officer or employee, of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
Section 9. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if the initiation of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the indemnitee was authorized in writing by the Board.
Section 10. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any indemnitee in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
Section 1. These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board, when such power is conferred upon the Board, by the Certificate of Incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws be contained in the notice of such meeting.
