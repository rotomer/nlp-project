If no agreement is reached within thirty (30) days, the LCIA Court shall appoint a third arbitrator to act as Chairman of the Tribunal. The Chairman of the arbitration panel should not be a citizen or a resident of the country of an arbitrator nominated by, or appointed on behalf of, a party nor should the Chairman be a citizen or a resident of the United States of America or the United Arab Emirates. It is hereby expressly agreed that if there is more than one claimant party or more than one respondent party, the claimant parties shall together nominate one arbitrator and the respondent parties shall together nominate one arbitrator. In the event that a sole claimant or the claimant parties, on the one side, or a sole respondent or the respondent parties, on the other side, fails to nominate its/their arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be appointed by the LCIA Court. Any award issued by the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties, and, subject to this Section 15.11, may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction by any of the parties. In the event any party subject to such final and binding award desires to have it confirmed by a final order of a court, the only court which may do so shall be a court of

competent jurisdiction located in London, England; provided however, that nothing in this sentence shall prejudice or prevent a party from enforcing the arbitrators' final and binding award in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any breach of the terms of this Agreement could give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties agree that, prior to the formation of the Tribunal, the parties have the right to apply exclusively to any court of competent jurisdiction or other judicial authority located in London, England for interim or conservatory measures, including, without limitation, to compel arbitration (an ""). Furthermore, the parties agree that, after the formation of the Tribunal, the arbitrators shall have the sole and exclusive power to grant temporary, preliminary and permanent relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, and any then pending Interim Relief Proceeding shall be discontinued without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties thereto. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrators pursuant to the terms hereof, the arbitrators' expenses shall be shared equally by the parties. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to: (i) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England located in London, England in relation to any Interim Relief Proceeding and; (ii) the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England located in London, England with respect to the enforcement of any arbitral award rendered in accordance with this Section 15.11; and, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding, waives any objection that it may have to the courts of England located in London, England on the grounds of inconvenient forum. For the avoidance of doubt, where an arbitral tribunal is appointed under this Agreement, the whole of its award shall be deemed for the purposes of the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958 to be contemplated by this Agreement, as the case may be (and judgment on any such award may be entered in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 15.11).
Interim Relief Proceeding
(d) The parties hereto agree that the process by which any arbitral or other proceedings in London, England are begun may be served on them by being delivered to Law Debenture Corporate Services Limited or their registered offices for the time being and by giving notice in accordance with Section 15.4. If Law Debenture Corporate Services Limited is not or ceases to be effectively appointed to accept service of process in England on any party's behalf, such party shall immediately appoint a further person in England to accept service of process on its behalf. If within fifteen (15) days of notice from a party requiring another party to appoint a person in England to accept service of process on its behalf the other party fails to do so, the party shall be entitled to appoint such a person by written notice to the other party. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of the parties to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

Subject to Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement, AMD will continually provide FoundryCo with the opportunity to respond to GPU Product business opportunities and Other Future Product business opportunities. AMD agrees to invite FoundryCo to participate in the RFQ process for any and all GPU Products and Other Future Products that are being developed within AMD (including the first tape-out of such GPU Product or Other Future Product) that could potentially be manufactured at FoundryCo.
AMD agrees to share present and future product requirements with FoundryCo so that FoundryCo can adequately respond to any RFQ requests coming from AMD. This will be accomplished through Quarterly Technical Reviews and Quarterly Business Reviews.
In the process of awarding business to FoundryCo, AMD will execute a benchmarking process on a product-by-product basis across a number of potential foundry partners (including FoundryCo), covering AMD's technical requirements and design system requirements, along with commercial terms. This benchmarking process can occur at any point in time and may or may not be coincident with the QTR or QBR meetings already occurring. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this benchmarking process shall not be undertaken by AMD with regards to MPU Products.
Subject to Section 2.1(c), in the event that FoundryCo has a [****], as determined by AMD, FoundryCo will be selected as the foundry partner for the development and production of that particular product. In the event that FoundryCo's offer is equivalent to the [****] of another foundry partner, as determined by AMD, FoundryCo will be selected as the foundry partner for the development and production of that particular product.
In the event that after an initial review of the available bids, AMD determines that FoundryCo's [****] is [****], AMD agrees to [****] a [****] with FoundryCo not to exceed [****] and to work collaboratively with FoundryCo during such [****] to attempt to [****] any [****] in the [****] to make the [****]. AMD also agrees that, at the point that AMD engages with FoundryCo on this [****] process, AMD will [****] with [****] to assist [****] in the [****] of their [****]. This [****] may be [****] at AMD's discretion.
After this [****], and subject to Section 2.1(c), if FoundryCo's offer becomes [****], as determined by AMD, AMD will select FoundryCo as the foundry partner for the development and production of that particular product.
In the event that, after this [****], AMD determines that FoundryCo's offer is [****], AMD is free to select another foundry partner as the foundry partner for the development of that particular product and will continue to [****] in [****] to assist FoundryCo in [****] its [****] such that FoundryCo will be more likely to [****] for future AMD [****].

As described in Section 5 of this Agreement, AMD will provide to FoundryCo, on a monthly basis, a rolling [****] month wafer forecast for MPU Products, a rolling [****] month wafer forecast for GPU Products, and a rolling [****] month forecast for Embedded Products.
For those Products other than MPU Products for which FoundryCo has received, and agreed to, purchase orders from AMD in accordance with Section 5.5, FoundryCo agrees to provide adequate capacity to produce such Products. In addition, FoundryCo agrees to allocate capacity to AMD as described in Section 2.2 of this Agreement.
For Embedded Products, so long as AMD gives FoundryCo commercially viable volume, FoundryCo agrees to maintain the process and equipment set required to manufacture these products for a period of [****] years, or if earlier, until the termination or expiration of this Agreement. The [****] year duration is measured from the qualification date of each specific Embedded Product and any extensions to the [****] year duration will be negotiated in good faith between AMD and FoundryCo.
For GPU Products, the Forecasted GPU Wafer Demand will be calculated on a monthly basis along with the Forecasted Total GPU Wafer Demand. The Forecasted GPU Wafer Demand Percentage will then be reviewed monthly as part of the Partnership Committee meeting as well as reviewed quarterly as part of the Quarterly Business Review. The Forecasted GPU Wafer Demand Percentage will be calculated based on the [****] fiscal months following and including the month that the Forecasted GPU Wafer Demand Percentage is shared with FoundryCo.
Also for GPU Products, the Actual Quarterly GPU Wafers Shipped will be calculated on a quarterly basis, along with the Actual Quarterly Total GPU Wafer Demand. The Actual Quarterly GPU Wafer Demand Percentage will then be reviewed with FoundryCo as part of the Quarterly Business Review. The Actual Quarterly GPU Wafer Demand Percentage will be calculated based on the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date that the Actual Quarterly GPU Wafer Demand Percentage is shared with FoundryCo.
FoundryCo and AMD jointly agree that if, at any time, either the Forecasted GPU Wafer Demand Percentage or the Actual Quarterly GPU Wafer Demand Percentage falls below the designated levels as described in Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement that both companies will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the percentage levels to their agreed upon values.

IN GENERAL
Wafers that sort to less than the RMA Threshold may not be scrapped without providing AMD with prior written notice and shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Exhibit F. FoundryCo must, at AMD's option, either credit the amounts paid for the rejected Wafers or replace the defective Wafers as set forth in this Exhibit E or Exhibit F, as applicable.
FoundryCo shall bear all packing, transportation, insurance and other costs incurred in connection with the return and replacement of defective Products. For MPU Products, in no event may FoundryCo charge AMD for replacement Wafers pursuant to this Exhibit E.
For all Wafers whose Yields fall below the RMA Threshold, FoundryCo will provide a credit or will deliver additional Wafers for the affected Products to make up for the shortfall of good Die in a manner to be determined by the Partnership Committee.
EPIDEMIC FAILURE
If an Epidemic Failure occurs, or if FoundryCo or AMD believes it may be necessary to conduct a Recall, the parties will work together to promptly diagnose the problem resulting in an Epidemic Failure or requiring the Recall and establish a corrective action plan to fix the problem with the affected Products and to implement such plan immediately upon the parties' agreement regarding the corrective action plan. If the parties cannot promptly agree upon a corrective action plan, the corrective action plan will be submitted to the Partnership Committee for resolution, or if the Partnership Committee cannot resolve the issue promptly, the parties will escalate the issue for resolution as set forth in Section 3.2 of this Agreement.
In the event of any Recall required due to (i) a manufacturing error, (ii) a breach of this Agreement by FoundryCo, or (iii) negligence or willful misconduct by FoundryCo, FoundryCo shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement: (a) replace the affected Products; or credit amounts previously paid by AMD for the affected Products against future payment obligations of AMD; and (b) reimburse (or at the election of AMD, credit) AMD for the actual costs and expenses incurred by AMD in respect of such recalled Products. Any Recall required because of a negligent act or omission in the additional manufacturing or testing, handling, storage, marketing, promotion, sale or distribution of Products, or as a result of AMD's designs or Specifications, or other breach of this Agreement by AMD shall be at AMD's sole expense.

Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.
Product scrapping occurs when the manufacturing of a Product is discontinued before the Product has completed all of its processing steps in the facility.
Product scrapping can be requested by FoundryCo only if the manufacturing process has fallen out of Specification and the delivered Products are expected to not meet the desired performance range or Yield. In this occurrence, the Partnership Committee will review the factory performance excursion and AMD will decide if the Product should be scrapped. If the decision is for such Product to be scrapped, at AMD's request, FoundryCo shall replace the affected Products or credit amounts previously paid by AMD for the affected Products against future payment obligations of AMD. In the event that AMD elects to run Products that are known to be out of Specification through the complete fabrication process, these Products will be taken from FoundryCo "AS IS", without any warranty of any kind, and there will be no RMA or profit-sharing variances performed on the purchase order value of those scrapped Products with FoundryCo.
In addition, AMD can request Product scrapping on a case-by-case basis at AMD's discretion. There is no limit to the number of Products that AMD can request to be scrapped. In the event that AMD requests Products to be scrapped, the Products will immediately be put on-hold at FoundryCo and an assessment will be made of where in the process the Products to be scrapped are located. The location in the process is defined by the last numerical masking step that the Products to be scrapped have been subjected to. For instance, if FoundryCo is running a process with 50 masking steps, and AMD requests a lot of Products to be scrapped, and those Products have been determined to have passed masking step 36 but have not yet passed masking step 37, the location in the process is defined as masking step 36.
In the event that AMD requests FoundryCo to scrap Products, AMD will render partial payment for the scrapped Products to FoundryCo relative to where in the process those scrapped Products are located. Using the example above, if a Product is requested by AMD to be scrapped, and the Product is determined to be at masking step 35 out of total of 50 masking steps in the technology, the Raw Wafer Cost was $200, and the Wafer Price of the Product was $1000, the scrap cost is calculated as
[Wafer Price  Raw Wafer Cost] x [percentage of total mask levels fabricated] + Raw Wafer Cost, which would be calculated as ($1000  $200) x (35/50) + $200 which equals $760.
It is AMD's decision whether the scrap cost is rendered to FoundryCo as an adjustment of the original purchase order pricing or through a credit note to FoundryCo, or though some other means.

Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.
Process Qualification Requirements will be reviewed on a Product-by-Product basis. In the situation where FoundryCo is making a technology offering that is not yet Qualified (for instance, in the early stages of the development of a new technology node), the parties will discuss and agree upon Specifications, the process technology to be employed, and the allowable variations in each of the following evaluation areas during the development and production phases of that technology or a specific Product.
The areas of evaluation will include at least the following:
1. . The die pricing is calculated from the Wafer Pricing, gross die per (GDPW), and Yield.
Die pricing
2. . AMD and FoundryCo will agree on a consistent manner in which Target Yield predictions will be made and may also monitor other parameters (such as defect densities) that are used in the calculation of Yield.
Yields
3.
Alignment with 3
rd
party assembly houses
. The manufacturing process performed by FoundryCo will adhere to the applicable sections of the Specifications that address AMD's need to take the Wafers manufactured by FoundryCo through the die assembly process within industry acceptable quality levels.
4. . For each process, FoundryCo must provide the ability for AMD to continuously monitor the position of Wafer orders as they progress through the FoundryCo manufacturing processes. It is expected that, starting in [****], this ability will be rendered from FoundryCo to AMD through a secure internet portal. Until the internet portal is available, FoundryCo will provide Wafer monitoring reports consistent with Exhibit D at a frequency to be agreed upon by the parties.
Wafer-in-process Monitoring
5. . AMD will perform product life tests on Products delivered from FoundryCo and will run tests including but not limited to short-term life, long-term life, and HAST (Highly Accelerated Stress Tests). The successful completion of these product life tests will be a gating item for the release of the Product to volume production at FoundryCo.
Product Life Test Procedures

Upon request from AMD, FoundryCo shall provide mask manufacturing services to AMD, including mask data prep, at [****]. As of the Effective Date, FoundryCo shall provide mask data prep services to AMD utilizing hardware and software owned or leased by AMD. The parties agree to secure alternative hardware and software going forward. AMD acknowledges that for each new technology, mask manufacturing research and development and mask data prep may require AMD-specific [****] that will be deemed to be AMD-Specific [****] pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Any additional mask sets required specifically (a) for FoundryCo in connection with its technology learning, (b) for process changes introduced by FoundryCo, (c) for replacements by FoundryCo to account for normal wear and tear or (d) to enable FoundryCo to manufacture a particular Product at more than one FoundryCo location, will be at FoundryCo's expense. AMD acknowledges that for the purpose of MPU Product pricing, mask costs may become part of the AMD MPU Specific [****].
Any new masks required by (a) design or Specification changes, (b) design learning desired by AMD, (c) process changes requested by AMD or (d) second sourcing requested by AMD or its customers will be paid by AMD at [****].
AMD and FoundryCo shall mutually agree on mask suppliers for the purpose of meeting all the required technical criteria at reasonable cost and fulfilling the [****] obligations in the Advanced Mask Technology Center. The parties acknowledge that for initial designs at each new technology node or at each process within a technology node, AMD may request, and FoundryCo may reasonably consider, early adopter incentives that may include discounted engineering, prototyping or production mask sets to AMD.
