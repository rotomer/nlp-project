On January 16, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") approved across-the-board reductions to annual base salaries, including the annual base salaries of all named executive officers, effective as of February 1, 2009. The reductions and new annual base salaries of the named executive officers are as follows: (i) Dr. Hector de J. Ruiz, the Company's Executive Chairman, 20% reduction to $899,200; (ii) Mr. Derrick Meyer, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, 20% reduction to $720,000; (iii) Mr. Robert Rivet, the Company's Executive Vice President, Chief Operations and Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, 15% reduction to $552,500; and (iv) Mr. Thomas McCoy, the Company's Executive Vice President, Legal, Corporate and Public Affairs, 15% reduction to $462,400. Because annual bonus targets are a percentage of annual base salary, the across-the-board reductions, in effect, will also result in a reduction of fiscal 2009 annual bonus payments, if any.
Dr. Ruiz and Mr. Meyer each signed amendments to their respective employment agreements to effect the reduction. A copy of the amendment agreement between the Company and Dr. Hector de J. Ruiz is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the amendment agreement between the Company and Mr. Derrick Meyer is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing descriptions of the amendment agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
