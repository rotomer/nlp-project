The information in this Report furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

The following disclosure constitutes a forward-looking statement that is based on current expectations and beliefs and involves numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. This forward-looking statement should not be relied upon as a prediction of future events as the Company cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in this statement will be achieved or will occur. The forward-looking statement relates to the Company's expectations relating to depreciation and amortization charges for fiscal year 2010. Material factors and assumptions that were applied in making these forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the following: (1) the expected rate of market growth and demand for the Company's products and technologies (and the mix thereof); (2) the Company's expected market share; (3) the Company's expected product and manufacturing costs and average selling prices; (4) the Company's overall competitive position and the competitiveness of the Company's current and future products; (5) the Company's ability to introduce new products and transition to more advanced manufacturing process technologies, consistent with the Company's current plans; (6) the Company's ability to make additional investment in research and development and that such opportunities will be available; and (7) the expected demand for computers. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: (1) that Intel Corporation's pricing, marketing and rebating programs, product bundling, standard setting, new product introductions or other activities may negatively impact sales; (2) that the Company's substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the Company's
financial position and prevent it from implementing the Company's strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; (3) that the Company will require additional funding and may be unable to raise sufficient capital, on favorable terms, or at all; (4) that the Company may be unable to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive; (5) that the Company may be unable to develop, launch and ramp new products and technologies in the volumes required by the market on a timely basis; (6) that the Company may be unable to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies in a timely and effective way; (7) that there may be unexpected variations in market growth and demand for the Company's products and technologies in light of the product mix that the Company may have available at any particular time; (8) that demand for computers will be lower than currently expected; (9) that the Company may under-utilize GLOBALFOUNDRIES' and the Company's own manufacturing facilities; and (10) the effect of political or economic instability, domestically or internationally, on the Company's sales or production. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statement in the following disclosure, see the "Risk Factors" section and elsewhere in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2008 and such other risks and uncertainties as detailed in the Company's other SEC reports and filings. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis only. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements.
The Company expects AMD Product Company fiscal year 2010 depreciation and amortization expense to be in the range of $340 million to $370 million.
For financial reporting purposes, AMD consolidates the operating results of GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. in its results as of March 2, 2009 and created the Foundry segment as of the start of the fiscal year. "AMD Product Company" refers to AMD, excluding the operating results of the Foundry segment and Intersegment eliminations. Intersegment eliminations consist of revenues, cost of sales and profits on inventory between AMD Product Company and the Foundry segment. AMD is providing the financial information for AMD Product Company because it believes it is important for investors to have visibility into AMD's financial results excluding the Foundry segment and Intersegment eliminations and to better understand AMD's financial results absent the requirement to consolidate the financial results of GLOBALFOUNDRIES.

AMD (NYSE: AMD) today announced that it commenced a cash tender offer for up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 5.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the "notes"). AMD intends to finance the purchase of the notes tendered in the tender offer with the net proceeds from the closing of AMD's private offering of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2017 (the "New Notes Offering"), which was separately announced by AMD today, and from the receipt of the $1.25 billion cash payment (the "Settlement Payment") from Intel Corporation pursuant to the Company's recently announced settlement agreement with Intel.
SUNNYVALE, Calif.  Nov. 18, 2009 
The tender offer will expire at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Wednesday, December 16, 2009, unless extended (such date and time, as it may be extended, the "Expiration Date") or earlier terminated by AMD. Holders who validly tender, and do not validly withdraw, their notes on or prior to the Expiration Date will be entitled to receive $990 for each $1,000 principal amount of notes purchased in the tender offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of payment for the notes accepted for payment. Tenders of notes must be made on or prior to the Expiration Date, and notes may be withdrawn at any time on or prior to the Expiration Date.
To the extent that acceptances of all validly tendered notes would require AMD to purchase more than $1,000,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes in connection with the tender offer, AMD will allocate acceptances on a pro rata basis among the tendering Holders.
The tender offer is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the closing of New Notes Offering, which will be subject to customary closing conditions, and the receipt of the Settlement Payment.
Full details of the terms and conditions of the tender offer are included in the Offer to Purchase, dated November 18, 2009, and AMD's Schedule TO which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Neither AMD, nor any member of its Board of Directors, nor the dealer managers nor the information agent is making any recommendation to Holders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their notes into the tender offer. Holders must decide whether they will tender in the offer and, if so, how many notes they will tender.
This release is for information purposes only and is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell the notes or any other securities. The tender offer is only being made pursuant to the tender offer documents, including the Offer to Purchase and the related letter of transmittal that AMD is distributing to Holders.
