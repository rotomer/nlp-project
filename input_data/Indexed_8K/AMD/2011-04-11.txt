In its Definitive Proxy Statement for the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (the "Company") disclosed that Benjamin Eberhart, the son of Paulett Eberhart, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, is employed as a manager for PRTM Management Consultants, Inc., a global management consulting firm ("PRTM"). In fiscal 2010, the Company paid PRTM approximately $1.6 million for consulting services. Mr. Eberhart was not involved in providing consulting services to AMD. The Company's Board of Directors considered this transaction and determined that it would not interfere with Ms. Eberhart's exercise of independent judgment as a member of the Company's Board of Directors or Chair of the Compensation Committee.
In its 2011 U.S. Proxy Voting Guidelines Summary dated January 27, 2011, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") categorizes a director as an Affiliated Outside Director, if among other things, such director or an immediate family member is an employee of an organization that provides professional services to the company in excess of $10,000 per year. In this regard, the Company is clarifying that PRTM does not currently provide services to the Company. In addition, in light of this ISS policy, the Company does not currently intend to engage PRTM for future services.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
