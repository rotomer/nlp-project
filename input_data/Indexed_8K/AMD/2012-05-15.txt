Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On May 9 and 10, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the "Company") took the following compensation actions with respect to certain Named Executive Officers of the Company (as set forth in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2012):
 
 
On the grant date, each of the above Named Executive Officer's Award Value will be converted into a mix of time-based stock options (with a grant date fair value equal to 25% of the Award Value), time-based restricted stock units (with a grant date fair value equal to 25% of the Award Value) and performance-based restricted stock units (with a grant date fair value equal to 50% of the Award Value) using the 30-day stock price average on the grant date and then-current binomial discount factor. These awards will be granted on June 15, 2012 under the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated.
The time-based stock options will have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the grant date, and will vest 33 1/3% on June 15, 2013 and 8.33% per quarter over the next eight following quarters.
The time-based restricted stock units will vest 1/3 on each of August 9, 2013, August 9, 2014 and August 9, 2015.
The performance-based restricted stock units will vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date if (i) the weighted average closing price of the Company's common stock over any 30-day period during the three-year vesting period is equal to or greater than $10.00 per share and (ii) the respective Named Executive Officer continues his employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
