Item 12.
Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On October 21, 2003, Amgen Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations and financial condition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
 
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-GAAP financial measures with respect to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2003
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with the Company's acquisition of Immunex Corporation ("Immunex") in July 2002 (the "Acquisition") and the Company's share of the loss incurred relating to the settlement of a patent litigation between the Company and Genentech, Inc. (the "Genentech Settlement").
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also relate to amounts associated with the recovery of certain cost and expenses associated with the Company's arbitration with Johnson & Johnson for breach of the license agreement with the Company (the "Cost Recovery") and the Company's cash contribution to the Amgen Foundation (the "Foundation Contribution").
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for the following operating expenses: cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative, which were each adjusted to exclude incremental compensation payable to certain Immunex employees for a limited period, principally under the Immunex short-term retention plan for the applicable period. The Company believes that excluding such incremental compensation provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the foregoing operating expense amounts, as well as excluding ongoing, non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets and the Genentech Settlement. The Company believes that excluding the ongoing, non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition (primarily ENBREL) treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the Genentech Settlement provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such item did not occur.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude all of the items identified above as being excluded in the three months ended September 30, 2003 for the reasons discussed above. The nine months ended September 30, 2003 also excludes the Cost Recovery and the Foundation Contribution. The Company believes that excluding the Cost Recovery and the Foundation Contribution provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur.
 
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2002
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to the amounts associated with the Acquisition and the benefit related to the recovery of certain amounts previously provided for in connection with terminating collaboration agreements with various third parties (the "Termination Benefit").
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for the following operating expenses: cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative, which were each adjusted to exclude incremental compensation payable to certain Immunex employees for a limited period, principally under the Immunex short-term retention plan for the applicable period. Cost of sales was further adjusted to exclude the non-cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired from Immunex at fair value (the "Fair Value Inventory Expense"). Selling, general and administrative was further adjusted to exclude external, incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integration of Immunex in connection with the Acquisition (the "Integration Costs"). The Company believes that excluding such incremental compensation, the Fair Value Inventory Expense and the Integration Costs provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses and costs are incurred.
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the foregoing operating expense amounts, as well as excluding the ongoing, non-cash amortization of intangible assets, the non-cash expense associated with writing off the acquired in-process research and development related to the Acquisition (the "IPR&D Write-off") and the Termination Benefit. The Company believes that excluding the ongoing, non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Acquisition (primarily ENBREL) treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the IPR&D Write-off and the Termination Benefit provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur.
 
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., October 21, 2003  Amgen Inc. (Nasdaq: AMGN) today announced that adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2003 was 53 cents versus adjusted earnings per share of 34 cents for the third quarter of 2002, an increase of 56%. Adjusted net income was $714 million in the third quarter of 2003 versus adjusted net income of $437 million in the third quarter of 2002, a 63% increase.
 
Adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 exclude certain expenses related to the acquisition of Immunex, and certain other items. These expenses and other items are detailed on the reconciliation tables below.
 
On a reported basis, calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Amgen reported earnings per share of 46 cents in the third quarter of 2003 versus a loss of $2.10 per share in the third quarter of 2002. GAAP net income for the third quarter 2003 was $612 million versus a loss of $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2002. The third quarter 2002 loss was principally due to the one-time write-off of in-process research and development of $3 billion related to the acquisition of Immunex.

Total revenue increased 47% to $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2003 versus the same period in 2002.
 
"This quarter we've seen solid performance across all of our marketed products, highlighted by the continuing success of Aranesp ," said Kevin Sharer, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our pipeline continues to progress, including our recent regulatory filings for cinacalcet HCl, a novel treatment that may help chronic kidney disease patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who are at risk of significant bone disease and cardiovascular complications. This quarter was also an active quarter in our collaborations with other companies as we continue our outreach efforts. I want to thank all of our staff at Amgen for their hard work towards bringing important therapies to people with serious illnesses," Sharer added.
 
Product Sales Performance and Expenses
 
Total product sales in the quarter were $2.1 billion, an increase of 54% over the same period last year. U.S. product sales were $1.8 billion, an increase of 47% versus the third quarter of last year. International sales were $300 million for the third quarter versus $138 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 117%. Without the beneficial impact of foreign exchange in the third quarter, international sales would have grown 91%.
 
For the third quarter, combined worldwide sales of EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa), Amgen's anemia therapy for patients on dialysis, and Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa), its latest anemia product for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure and anemia due to chemotherapy, increased 58% to $1.1 billion from $672 million for the third quarter of 2002. This increase was substantially driven by worldwide Aranesp sales. EPOGEN sales were $626 million for the third quarter, an increase of 12% over the same quarter last year. The company indicated that the growth was principally due to a favorable revised estimate of dialysis demand for prior quarters. This adjustment, which results from spillover, is due to the company's contractual relationship with Johnson & Johnson. (Please refer to the Company's 2002 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of this relationship and a description of spillover.)
 
EPOGEN demand in the third quarter grew in the mid-single-digit range compared to the prior year. For the full year 2003, the company continues to believe that underlying dialysis patient growth, in the range of 4% to 5%, will principally drive EPOGEN sales.
 
Worldwide Aranesp sales in the third quarter were $438 million versus $114 million in the third quarter of last year. The company believes worldwide Aranesp sales were primarily driven by demand. Sales growth reflects the mid-year 2002 approval for the incremental indication for chemotherapy-induced anemia in

oncology in the U.S. and growth in Europe. Third quarter U.S. Aranesp sales were $284 million versus $77 million last year. International Aranesp sales were $154 million versus $37 million in the third quarter last year. The growth in international Aranesp sales was aided by $19 million in foreign exchange benefits due to a weaker U.S. dollar.
 
The company now expects combined EPOGEN/Aranesp sales to be between $3.8 and $4.0 billion in 2003 versus the previous range of between $3.7 and $3.9 billion.
 
Combined worldwide sales of Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim) increased 39% to $657 million from $474 million in the third quarter last year. Worldwide Neulasta sales were $327 million in the third quarter of 2003, $23 million of which were international sales. U.S. Neulasta sales were $304 million in the third quarter versus $142 million for the third quarter last year, and were demand driven. Worldwide NEUPOGEN sales were $330 million for the third quarter of 2003, a slight decline from the third quarter of 2002. This reflects a decline in the U.S. due to conversion to Neulasta, offset by the sales growth in international markets. Neulasta is Amgen's once-per-cycle product for decreasing the risk of chemotherapy-related infections, and NEUPOGEN is used to decrease the incidence of infection during many types of cancer-related chemotherapy. The company indicated that the conversion from NEUPOGEN to Neulasta has slowed in the U.S.
 
On a geographic basis, third quarter NEUPOGEN sales were $228 million in the U.S. versus $241 million in the third quarter of 2002, and $103 million outside the U.S. versus $91 million in the third quarter of 2002. International NEUPOGEN sales growth was due to a weaker U.S. dollar.
 
The company continues to expect combined NEUPOGEN/Neulasta sales to range between $2.4 and $2.6 billion in 2003.
 
ENBREL (etanercept), Amgen's leading inflammation biologic, had third quarter sales of $342 million, a 116% increase over third quarter 2002 sales of $158 million. ENBREL sales in the third quarter were driven by new patients in both rheumatology and dermatology. Third quarter 2002 ENBREL sales were adversely affected by supply shortages, and to a lesser extent, reflect two weeks fewer sales as a result of the acquisition of Immunex on July 15, 2002. Amgen continues to expect ENBREL sales to range between $1.2 and $1.4 billion in 2003.
 
The company now expects total product sales will range between $7.6 and $7.9 billion in 2003 versus the previous range of between $7.5 and $8.0 billion. Total revenue is now expected to range between $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion versus the previous range of between $8.0 and $8.5 billion.

Operating Expenses on an adjusted basis in both periods were as follows:
 
 
 
 
Amgen indicated that it expected fourth quarter adjusted 2003 R&D and SG&A spending to be higher than previous quarters of 2003 in dollars and as a percentage of sales. Amgen also indicated that it now expects adjusted operating expense to range between $4.7 and $4.9 billion for 2003 versus the previous range of between $4.6 and $4.8 billion.
 
For the full year, the company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95. The company indicated that in the fourth quarter it will expense the up-front payment of $86.5 million associated with the licensing agreement with Biovitrum. This payment will impact GAAP and adjusted earnings.
 
In the third quarter of 2003, share repurchases were $323 million representing the repurchase of approximately 5 million shares. Through the first nine months of 2003, share repurchases were approximately $1.2 billion representing 20 million shares. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $388 million compared to $209 million for the same period a year ago. The increase was principally related to the company's Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion, the construction of the company's research center in Seattle, and the building of a new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island. The company's cash and marketable securities were $5.0 billion at the end of the quarter.
 
The company announced plans to provide financial guidance for 2004 on a conference call in December.

Pipeline Update
 
Amgen announced that it had submitted an application to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for cinacalcet HCl, the company's first small molecule therapeutic, for hyperparathyroidism.
 
The company announced earlier that it had received approval for a 50 mg once-weekly dosage of ENBREL for adult patients across all indications, including moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active arthritis in patients with psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and a 0.8mg/kg once-weekly dosage (maximum 50 mg per week) for patients ages four to 17 years with moderately-to-severely active juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 
The company indicated that it has almost 40 development programs. Included are molecules that may provide advancements in oncology supportive care, targeted treatment of malignancy, pain control, management of inflammatory disease, treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, control of bone turnover, and the management of metabolic disturbances.
 
The company also announced plans to hold a meeting to review its R&D pipeline in the first quarter of 2004.
