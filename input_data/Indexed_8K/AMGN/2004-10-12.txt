Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 5, 2004, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Amgen Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Amgen Retirement and Savings Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2003) (the "Retirement and Savings Plan") and approved the amendment and restatement of the Amgen Supplemental Retirement Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective November 1, 1999) (the "Supplemental Retirement Plan") and the Amgen Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan"), respectively. A description of the amendment and the amendment and restatement, as the case may be, to each plan follows below.
 
Third Amendment of the Retirement and Savings Plan
 
The Third Amendment to the Retirement and Savings Plan, effective on the dates specified therein, provides, among other things, clarification of the groups of individuals who are eligible to participate in the plan and eliminates the year of service requirement for regular part-time employee eligibility. It also provides that true-up matching contributions will generally be made quarterly and that the suspension of a participant from the plan for plan loan default is six months instead of twelve months. The amendment provides that if a participant has entered into an arbitration agreement with the Company, that arbitration agreement will govern following the participant's compliance with the plan's claims procedures. Further this amendment is designed to clarify certain administrative practices and allows the plan to be a "safe harbor" plan to eliminate certain non-discrimination testing requirements. The form of this amendment is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Amendment and Restatement of the Supplemental Retirement Plan
 
The Supplemental Retirement Plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2005 to incorporate amendments to the plan since its most recent amendment and restatement and to provide, among other things, that employees of certain subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company are eligible to participate, that eligible employees are automatically enrolled and will receive a contribution equal to 10% of their eligible compensation, that installments are eliminated as a distribution option and that the vesting schedule for contributions under the plan is a three-year cliff (except for contributions made with respect to contributions to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, which vest immediately). The plan is further amended to provide that the elapsed time method for counting service will be used in lieu of tracking actual hours of service. The form of this plan as amended and restated is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.2.
 
Amendment and Restatement of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
 
The Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan is amended and restated effective January 1, 2005 to incorporate amendments made to the plan since its adoption and to amend the plan to provide, among other things, that employees of certain subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company are eligible to participate, that the minimum annual deferral be raised to $5,000 and that participants may elect to time their plan deferrals so that deferrals will begin after they have made the maximum deferrals allowed under the Company's 401(k) or 1165(e) plan, as applicable. The plan's distribution provisions are amended to eliminate retirement age as a basis for distribution, to allow a participant who terminates his or her employment for any reason to receive installments, to provide that installments will commence and lump sum distributions will occur as soon as administratively practicable after the start of the plan year following the plan year in which the participant's employment terminated and to eliminate voluntary in-service withdrawals (except for those relating to unforeseeable financial emergencies). The plan is also amended to limit installment elections to vested account balances in excess of $50,000 and to eliminate the ability of beneficiaries to convert installment payments to a lump sum distribution. Further, the plan is amended to provide that if a participant has entered into an arbitration agreement with the Company, that arbitration agreement will govern following the participant's compliance with the plan's claims procedures. The form of this plan as amended and restated is filed with this report as Exhibit 10.3.
 
Also on October 5, 2004, the Compensation Committee approved a retention payment in the amount of $1,000,000.00 to be credited to the account of Fabrizio Bonanni, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. The retention payment constitutes a "Company Contribution" under the terms of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan and, pursuant to the terms of that plan, the Compensation Committee established vesting provisions for such Company Contribution. Under these provisions, Mr. Bonanni will vest in the Company Contribution when he satisfies the following conditions: 1) he remains actively and continuously employed with the Company or an Employer (as defined in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan) through and including August 1, 2007 and 2) it is determined by Kevin Sharer, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, (or his successor or designee), in his (or her) sole discretion, that during the period between the awarding of the Company Contribution and August 1, 2007, Mr. Bonanni continued to perform his job responsibilities in an exceptional manner. Further, if prior to August 1, 2007, Mr. Bonanni's employment terminates as a result of his death or if Mr. Bonanni experiences a Disability (as defined in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan), the Company Contribution will vest immediately. The Company Contribution is subject to gains and losses, depending upon Mr. Bonanni's Measurement Fund (as defined in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan) selections. Such Company Contribution will be credited to Mr. Bonanni's account on October 13, 2004. Except where made more specific by the above, the general terms and conditions of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended from time to time, apply to the Company Contribution.

Company's Right to Terminate
 
 
9.1 . This Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan for tax law purposes and for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), maintained primarily to provide benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. This Plan is not intended to create an investment contract, but to provide tax planning opportunities and retirement benefits to eligible individuals who have elected to participate in the Plan. Eligible individuals are members of management who, by virtue of their position with the Company, are uniquely informed as to the Company's operations and have the ability to materially affect the Company's profitability and operations.
Unfunded Plan
 
9.2 . Neither you nor your Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns will have any legal or equitable rights, interest or claims in any property or assets of the Company, nor will they be Beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts or the proceeds therefrom owned or which may be acquired by the Company. Such policies or other assets of the Company will not be held under any trust for your benefit or that of your Beneficiaries, heirs, successors or assigns, or held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Company under this Plan. Any and all of the Company's assets and policies will be, and remain, the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligation under the Plan will be that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor
 
9.3 . The Company will pay all Plan benefits. At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of such benefits. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof will be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company will have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits will remain the obligation of, and paid by, the Company.
Trust Fund
 
9.4 . Neither you nor any other person may commute, sell, assign, transfer, hypothecate or convey in advance of actual receipt the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable. No part of the amounts payable will, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by you or any other person (other than amounts owed to the Company's creditors in the event of the Company's insolvency), nor be transferable by operation of law in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of you or any other person (other than the Company). Notwithstanding the above, vested benefits will be payable to an individual other than you under this Plan in accordance with a court order upon the determination by the Committee that such order (i) has been issued by a court with appropriate jurisdiction (ii) has been properly served on the Company, (iii) is reasonably clear to, and administrable by, the Committee, (iv) does not require any benefit not otherwise provided under the Plan, and (v) requires payment of a portion of your vested Account to someone other than you.
Nonassignability
 
9.5 . The terms and conditions of this Plan may not be construed to constitute a contract of employment between you and the Company and you (or your Beneficiary) will have no rights against the Company except as otherwise specifically provided herein. Moreover, nothing in this Plan will be deemed to give you the right to be retained in the service of the Company as an employee or otherwise, or to interfere with the right of the Company to discipline or discharge you at any time.
Not a Contract of Employment
 
9.6 . You are required to cooperate with the Company by furnishing any and all information requested by the Company in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder.
Cooperation
 
9.7 . Whenever words are used in this Plan in the masculine they will be construed as though they were used in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and whenever any words are used in this Plan in the singular or in the plural, they will be construed as though they were used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.
Terms
 
9.8 . The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of this Plan are for convenience only and do not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.
Captions
 
9.9 . The provisions of this Plan are to be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California to the extent that they have not been preempted by federal law.
Governing Law
 
9.10 . In case any provision of this Plan is found to be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts hereof, but this
