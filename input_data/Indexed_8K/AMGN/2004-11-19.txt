The Securities were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee.
The Purchase Agreement provides that the Securities will be offered and sold to the Initial Purchasers and reoffered by the Initial Purchasers without being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), in reliance on applicable exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
The Initial Purchasers and their direct and indirect transferees will be entitled to the benefits of a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2004 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to register the Securities under the Securities Act within a specified time or pay additional amounts to the holders of notes.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, which were approximately $1.99 billion, primarily for purchases of shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital.
The 2009 Notes will bear interest at 4.00% per year and will mature on November 18, 2009. The 2014 Notes will bear interest at 4.85% per year and will mature on November 18, 2014. Interest on the Securities will be payable on May 18 and November 18 of each year, beginning on May 18, 2005. Interest on the Securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and will accrue from November 18, 2004.
The Company has the right to redeem any or all of the Securities at any time pursuant to a make-whole provision. The Securities are not entitled to a sinking fund and the Holders of the Securities may not require the Company to repurchase the Securities.
The above descriptions of the Indenture, the Securities, the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement are summaries only and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the respective exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS "OFFSHORE TRANSACTION." "UNITED STATES" AND "U.S. PERSON" HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. THE INDENTURE CONTAINS A PROVISION REQUIRING THE TRUSTEE TO REFUSE TO REGISTER ANY TRANSFER OF THIS NOTE IN VIOLATION OF THE FOREGOING RESTRICTION."

Certificated Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Certificated Notes tendered into the Exchange Offer pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. Such Global Securities and Certificated Notes shall will not contain the restrictive legend set forth in Item 7 above. Concurrently with the issuance of such Exchange Securities, the Company will instruct the Trustee to cause the aggregate principal amount of the applicable Global Securities and Certificated Notes to be reduced accordingly. 8.

The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to (i) cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the 1933 Act within 270 days of the Closing Date (or if such 270th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) and (ii) consummate the Exchange Offer within 310 days of the Closing Date (or if such 310th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day). Upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Exchange Offer by delivering the related exchange offer Prospectus and accompanying documents, if any, to each Holder stating, in addition to such other disclosures as are required by applicable law: (i) that the Exchange Offer is being made pursuant to this Registration Rights Agreement and that all Registrable Securities validly tendered will be accepted for exchange; (ii) the expiration date for acceptance for exchange (which shall be a date at least 20 Business Days from the date such Prospectus is delivered, and which may be extended by the Company from time to time pursuant to the procedures set forth in such Prospectus) (the "EXPIRATION Date"); (iii) that any Registrable Security not tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest, but will not retain any rights under this Registration Rights Agreement; (iv) that Holders electing to have a Registrable Security exchanged pursuant to the Exchange Offer will be required to surrender such Registrable Security, together with the enclosed letters of transmittal, if any, to the institution and at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date; and (v) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election, not later than the close of business on the Expiration Date, by sending to the institution and at the address specified in such Prospectus a written or facsimile notice of withdrawal setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Registrable Securities delivered for exchange and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such 5
Securities exchanged. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Expiration Date, the Company shall: (i) accept for exchange Registrable Securities or portions thereof tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and (ii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation all Registrable Securities or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the Company and issue, and cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and deliver to each Holder, an Exchange Security equal in principal amount to the principal amount of the Registrable Securities surrendered by such Holder. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and other applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer. The Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the Exchange Offer does not violate applicable law or any applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC. The Company agrees (x) to include in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement a prospectus for use in any resales by any holder of Exchange Securities that is a Participating Broker-Dealer and (y) to use reasonable efforts to keep such Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective for a period of 90 days after the Expiration Date (as such period may be extended pursuant to the penultimate paragraph of Section 3 of this Agreement) (the "RESALE Period"). (b) In the event that (i) the Company determines that the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not available or may not be consummated within a reasonable period of time after the Expiration Date because it would violate applicable law or the applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any other reason consummated within 310 days of the Closing Date or (iii) the Exchange Offer has been completed and in the opinion of counsel for the Initial Purchasers, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, a Registration Statement must be filed and a Prospectus must be delivered by the Initial Purchasers in connection with any offering or sale of Registrable Securities, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such determination, date or notice of such opinion of counsel is given to the Company, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration Statement providing for the sale by the Holders of all of the Registrable Securities and shall use its reasonable efforts to have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC, provided, that, in no event shall the Company be required to file or cause to be declared effective such Shelf Registration Statement before the date on which it is required to file or cause to be declared effective, as applicable, the Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a). In the event the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration Statement solely as a result of the matters referred to in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall file and use its reasonable efforts to have declared 6
effective by the SEC both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2(a) with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the Exchange Offer. The Company agrees to use its reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the expiration of the period referred to in Rule 144(k) with respect to the Registrable Securities or such shorter period that will terminate when all of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company further agrees to supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration Statement, by the 1933 Act or by any other rules and regulations thereunder for shelf registration or if reasonably requested by a Holder with respect to information relating to such Holder, and to use its reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective and such Shelf Registration Statement to become usable as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. The Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after its being used or filed with the SEC. (c) The Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with the registration pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b). Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. (d) Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, the Company acknowledges that any failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) may result in material irreparable injury to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the Company's obligations under Section 2(a) and Section 2(b). 3. Registration Procedures. In connection with the obligations of the Company with respect to the Registration Statements pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b), the Company shall: (a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on the appropriate form under the 1933 Act, which form (x) shall be selected by the Company and (y) shall, in the case of a Shelf Registration, be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities by the selling Holders thereof and (z) shall comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable form and include all financial statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith, and use its reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective in accordance with Section 2; 7
(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments to each Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the applicable period and cause each Prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement and, as so supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the 1933 Act; to keep each Prospectus current during the period described under Section 4(3) and Rule 174 under the 1933 Act that is applicable to transactions by brokers or dealers with respect to the Registrable Securities or Exchange Securities; (c) in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each selling Holder of Registrable Securities, to counsel for the Initial Purchasers, to counsel for the Holders and to each Underwriter of an Underwritten Offering of Registrable Securities, if any, without charge, as many copies of each Prospectus, including each preliminary Prospectus, and any amendment or supplement thereto and such other documents as such Holder or Underwriter may reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities; and the Company consents to the use of such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law by each of the selling Holders of Registrable Securities and any such Underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by and in the manner described in such Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with applicable law; (d) use its reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Securities under all applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement shall reasonably request in writing by the time the applicable Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, to cooperate with reasonable requests by such Holders in connection with any filings required to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary to enable such Holder to consummate the disposition in each such jurisdiction of such Registrable Securities owned by such Holder; provided, however, that, without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), (ii) file any general consent to service of process, (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not so subject or (iv) make any changes to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws; (e) in the case of a Shelf Registration, notify each selling Holder of Registrable Securities, counsel for the Holders and counsel for the Initial Purchasers promptly (i) when a Registration Statement has become effective and when any post-effective amendment thereto has been filed and becomes effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC or any state securities authority for amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement and Prospectus or for additional information after the Registration 8
Statement has become effective, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the happening of any event during the period a Shelf Registration Statement is effective which makes any statement made in such Registration Statement or the related Prospectus untrue in any material respect or which requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to make the statements therein not misleading and (v) of any determination by the Company that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be required by applicable law; (f) make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement at the earliest practicable date; (g) in the case of a Shelf Registration, furnish to each Holder of Registrable Securities upon written request therefor, without charge, one conformed copy of each Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto (without documents incorporated therein by reference or exhibits thereto, unless requested); (h) in the case of a Shelf Registration, cooperate with the selling Holders of Registrable Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends and enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations (consistent with the provisions of the Indenture) and registered in such names as the selling Holders may reasonably request in writing at least five Business Days prior to the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities; (i) in the case of a Shelf Registration, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section 3(e)(iv), use its reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement or the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Securities, such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company agrees to notify the selling Holders to suspend use of the Prospectus as promptly as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of such an event, and such Holders hereby agree to suspend use of the Prospectus until the Company has amended or supplemented the Prospectus to correct such misstatement or omission; (j) obtain a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, not later than the effective date of a Registration Statement; (k) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA, in connection with the 9
registration of the Exchange Securities or Registrable Securities, as the case may be, cooperate with the Trustee and the Holders to effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA and execute, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely manner; (l) in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by any Underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement, and attorneys and accountants designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, all financial and other records, pertinent documents and properties of the Company, and cause the respective officers, directors and employees of the Company to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement; (m) if reasonably requested by any Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable incorporate in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect to such Holder as such Holder reasonably requests to be included therein and (ii) make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment after the Company has received written notification of the matters to be incorporated in such filing, and, in the case of a post-effective amendment, use its reasonable best efforts to have the post-effective amendment declared effective; and (n) in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary underwriting agreements or similar agreements and take all such other customary actions in connection therewith as any selling Holders aggregating at least a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold may reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, pursuant to an Underwritten Offering and in such connection, (i) to the extent reasonably practicable, make such representations and warranties to the Holders and any Underwriters of such Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Registration Statement, Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same if and when requested, (ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company (which counsel may be the Company's general counsel or assistant general counsel and which opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and such Underwriters and their respective counsel) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities (it being agreed that the matters to be covered by any such opinion shall include the due incorporation, valid existence and good standing of the Company; the qualification of the Company to transact business as a foreign 10
corporation; the due authorization, execution and delivery of the relevant agreements of the type referred to in this Section 2(o); the due authorization, execution, authentication, issuance and delivery, and the validity and enforceability of the Registrable Securities; the absence of governmental approvals required to be obtained in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities, this Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement or any agreement of the type referred to in Section 2(o), except such approvals as may be required under state securities or blue sky laws; the material compliance as to form of such Shelf Registration Statement and any documents incorporated by reference therein and of the Indenture with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the TIA and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, respectively; and, as of the date of the opinion and of the Shelf Registration Statement or most recent post-effective amendment thereto, as the case may be, the absence from such Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus included therein, as then amended or supplemented, and from the documents incorporated by reference therein (in each case other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein) of an untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of such documents, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time that such documents were filed with the SEC under the 1934 Act)), (iii) obtain "cold comfort" letters from the independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the Company, or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included in the Registration Statement) addressed to each selling Holder and Underwriter of Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in connection with underwritten offerings, and (iv) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties of the Company made pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in an underwriting agreement. In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Company such information in writing regarding the Holder and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing. In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(e)(iv), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(i), and, if so directed by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company (at its expense) all copies in its possession, 11
other than permanent file copies then in such Holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

The Company may give any such notice only twice during any 365 day period and any such suspensions may not exceed 45 days in any three month period or 120 days in any 12 month period. No Special Interest shall accrue or be payable during any such suspension period. The Holders of Registrable Securities covered by a Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers (the "UNDERWRITERS") that will administer the offering will be selected by the Majority Holders of the Registrable Securities included in such offering. 4. Special Interest. (a) The parties acknowledge that the Holders of Securities or Exchange Securities, as the case may be, will suffer damages if the Company fails to perform its obligations under Section 2 or 3 and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages. Accordingly, in the event that: (i) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been filed on or prior to the 180th day following the Closing Date; (ii) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective on or prior to the 270th day following the Closing Date; (iii) the Exchange Offer has not been consummated on or prior to the 310th day following the Closing Date (if the Exchange Offer is then required to be completed); or (iv) after either the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, such Registration Statement ceases to be effective or usable in connection with the Exchange Offer or resales of the Securities during a period in which it is required to be effective hereunder (taking into account the suspension periods provided for in the penultimate paragraph of Section 3) without being succeeded within five Business Days by any additional Registration Statement or post- 12
effective amendment covering the Securities or the Exchange Securities, as the case may be, which has been filed and declared effective; (each such event referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), a "REGISTRATION DEFAULT"), then special interest ("SPECIAL INTEREST") will accrue on the principal amount of the Securities and the Exchange Securities, respectively (in addition to the stated interest on the Securities and the Exchange Securities), from and including the date on which any Registration Default first occurs and while any such Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, to but excluding the date on which all filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations, as the case may be, have been achieved which, if achieved on a timely basis, would have prevented the occurrence of all of the then existing Registration Defaults. Special Interest will accrue at a rate of 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following such first occurrence of a Registration Default and while any such Registration Default has occurred and is continuing, and shall increase to 0.50% per annum for any additional days after such 90-day period during which a Registration Default had occurred and is continuing, until the date on which all of the filings, declarations of effectiveness and consummations referred to in the preceding sentence have been achieved, on which date the interest rate on the Securities and the Exchange Securities, respectively, will revert to the interest rate originally borne by such notes. (b) The Company shall notify the Trustee immediately upon its knowledge of the happening of each and every Registration Default. (c) The Company shall pay the Special Interest due on the Securities or Exchange Securities, as the case may be, by depositing with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders thereof, prior to 10:00 a.m. on the next interest payment date specified in the Indenture sums sufficient to pay the Special Interest then due. The Special Interest due shall be payable on each interest payment date specified by the Indenture to the record holders entitled to receive the interest payment to be made on such date. (d) The parties agree that the Special Interest provided for in this Section 4 constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by Holders of Securities or Exchange Securities by reason of the happening of any Registration Default. 5. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, each Holder and each Person, if any, who controls each Initial Purchaser or any Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, or is under common control with, or is controlled by, any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, from and against all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Initial Purchaser, any Holder or any such controlling or affiliated Person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) pursuant to which Exchange Securities or 13
Registrable Securities were registered under the 1933 Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to an indemnified party furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such indemnified party expressly for use therein, provided however that, the foregoing indemnity with respect to any preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased Securities, or any person controlling such Holder, if a copy of the final Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Holder to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if the final Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. In connection with any Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Company will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement. (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Initial Purchaser and the other selling Holders, and each of their respective directors, officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company, any Initial Purchaser and any other selling Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or any Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above, such Person (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any 14
indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (a) the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Initial Purchasers and all Persons, if any, who control any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, (b) the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (c) the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Holders and all Persons, if any, who control any Holders within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In such case involving any Initial Purchaser and Persons who control any Initial Purchaser, such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. In such case involving the Holders and such Persons who control Holders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Majority Holders. In all other cases, such firm shall be designated by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such 15
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Holders shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Registrable Securities of such Holder that were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement. (e) The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which Registrable Securities were sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity. The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser, any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any Person controlling the Company, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement. 16
6. Miscellaneous. (a) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered into, and on or after the date of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back, if telexed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied; and on the next Business Day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery. Copies of all such notices, demands, or other communications shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee, at the address specified in the Indenture. (d) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express assignment, subsequent Holders; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement. If any transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities, in any manner, whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be held subject to all of the terms of this Agreement, 17
and by taking and holding such Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof. The Initial Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or obligation to the Company with respect to any failure by a Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of such Holder under this Agreement. (e) Purchases and Sales of Securities. The Company shall not, and shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its affiliates (as defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) not to, purchase and then resell or otherwise transfer any Securities.

The Holders shall be third party beneficiaries to the agreements made hereunder between the Company, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent they deem such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect their rights as Holders hereunder. (g) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. (h) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. (i) Governing Law.

(k) Section References. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Agreement to sections are to the sections of this Agreement. (l) Termination. This Agreement shall terminate when there are no longer any Registrable Securities, except for (i) any liabilities or obligations under Section 2(c) and Section 5 and (ii) the Company's obligation to make payments of, and to provide for, Special Interest under Section 4, to the extent Special Interest accrued prior to such time, each of which shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms. 18

(d) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3(d), (ii) file any general consent to service of process, (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not so subject or (iv) make any changes to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws. (e) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, to pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and the Company's accountants in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities and all other fees or expenses of the Company in connection with the preparation of each Memorandum and all amendments and supplements thereto, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the delivering of copies thereof to the Initial Purchasers, in the quantities herein above specified, (ii) all costs and expenses related to the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers, including any transfer or other taxes payable thereon, (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 6(d) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Initial Purchasers in connection with such qualification and in connection with the preparation of any Blue Sky or legal investment memorandum, (iv) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Securities, (v) the costs and charges of the Trustee, and (vi) all other cost and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not 14

(f) Not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to, sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined in the Securities Act) which could be integrated with the sale of the Securities in a manner which would require the registration under the Securities Act of the Securities. (g) Not to solicit any offer to buy or offer or sell the Securities by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are used in Regulation D under the Securities Act) or in any manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. (h) While any of the Securities remain "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) of the Securities Act, to make available, upon request, to any seller of such Securities the information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act, unless the Company is then subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (i) Not to, and to cause its Affiliates or any person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchasers) not to, engage in any directed selling efforts (as that term is defined in Regulation S) with respect to the Securities, and the Company and its Affiliates and each person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchasers) will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S. (j) During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to resell any of the Securities which constitute "restricted securities" under Rule 144 that have been reacquired by any of them. 7. Offering of Securities; Restrictions on Transfer. (a) Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents and warrants that such Initial Purchaser is a qualified institutional buyer as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (a "QIB"). Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that (i) it will not solicit offers for, or offer or sell, such Securities by any form of general solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are used in Regulation D under the Securities Act) or in any manner 15
involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and (ii) it will solicit offers for such Securities only from, and will offer such Securities only to, persons that it reasonably believes to be (A) in the case of offers inside the United States, QIBs and (B) in the case of offers outside the United States, to persons other than U.S. persons ("FOREIGN PURCHASERS," which term shall include dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a discretionary basis for foreign beneficial owners (other than an estate or trust)) in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act that, in each case, in purchasing such Securities are deemed to have represented and agreed as provided in the Final Memorandum under the caption "Transfer Restrictions". (b) Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents, warrants, and agrees with respect to offers and sales outside the United States that: (i) such Initial Purchaser understands that no action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by the Company that would permit a public offering of the Securities, or possession or distribution of either Memorandum or any other offering or publicity material relating to the Securities, in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required; (ii) such Initial Purchaser will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which it acquires, offers, sells or delivers Securities or has in its possession or distributes either Memorandum or any such other material, in all cases at its own expense; (iii) the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act; (iv) such Initial Purchaser has offered the Securities and will offer and sell the Securities (A) as part of their distribution at any time and (B) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the Closing Date, only in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S or as otherwise permitted in Section 7(a); accordingly, neither such Initial Purchaser, its Affiliates nor any persons acting on its or their behalf have engaged or will engage in any directed selling efforts (within the meaning of Regulation S) with respect to the Securities, and any such Initial Purchaser, its Affiliates and any such persons have complied and will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S; 16
(v) such Initial Purchaser has (A) not offered or sold and, prior to the date six months after the Closing Date, will not offer or sell any Securities to persons in the United Kingdom except to persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995; (B) complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom, and (C) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Securities in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to the Company; (vi) such Initial Purchaser understands that the Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities and Exchange Law of Japan, and represents that it has not offered or sold, and agrees not to offer or sell, directly or indirectly, any Securities in Japan or for the account of any resident thereof except pursuant to any exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities and Exchange Law of Japan and otherwise in compliance with applicable provisions of Japanese law; and (vii) such Initial Purchaser agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of sales of the Securities, it will have sent to each distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration that purchases Securities from it during the restricted period a confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect: "The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and may not be offered and sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering and the closing date, except in either case in accordance with Regulation S (or Rule 144A if available) under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meaning given to them by Regulation S." Terms used in this Section 7(b) have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. 17
8. Indemnity and Contribution. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Initial Purchaser may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either Memorandum or any other prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus) relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such Initial Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in either Memorandum or any other prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus) relating to the Securities, or in any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Initial Purchaser expressly for use in either Memorandum as amended or supplemented; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Memorandum or preliminary prospectus, including any amendment or supplement thereto, shall not inure to the benefit of any Initial Purchaser from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities, or any person controlling such Initial Purchaser, if a copy of the Final Memorandum (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of such Initial Purchaser to such person, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the Securities to such person, and if the Final Memorandum (as so amended or supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability. (b) Each Initial Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in either Memorandum or any other prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus) relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, 18
that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in either Memorandum or any other prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus) relating to the Securities, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Initial Purchaser expressly for use in either Memorandum as amended or supplemented; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. (c) As promptly as reasonably practical after receipt by an indemnified party under paragraph (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it of its obligations (i) under paragraph (a) or (b), as applicable, of this Section 8 unless and only to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by the failure to notify, or (ii) from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such applicable subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, and retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (1) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (2) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would, in the written opinion of legal counsel to the indemnified party, be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be 19
reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or, if Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is not an indemnified party and is not reasonably likely to become an indemnified party, by the Initial Purchasers that are indemnified parties, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (a) above, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to paragraph (b) above. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (I) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (II) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Initial Purchaser on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and each Initial Purchaser on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Initial Purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions and discounts received by such Initial Purchaser in respect thereof. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to 20
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or by any Initial Purchaser on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and each Initial Purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if all Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Initial Purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities referred to in paragraph (d) above that were offered and sold to the public through such Initial Purchaser exceeds the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Initial Purchasers under this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by or through each such Initial Purchaser to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates and are not joint. (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act; and the obligations of each Initial Purchaser under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which such Initial Purchaser may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. 9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the Initial Purchasers' absolute discretion, by written notice to the Company, if (a) 21
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the judgment of the Initial Purchasers, is material and adverse and (b) in the case of any of the events specified in clauses (a)(i) through (iv), such event, singly or together with any other such event, makes it, in the judgment of the Initial Purchasers, impracticable to market the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Final Memorandum. 10. Effectiveness; Defaulting Initial Purchasers. This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Initial Purchaser has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Initial Purchaser. If, on the Closing Date any Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser or of the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Final 22
Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Initial Purchasers, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers or such Initial Purchasers as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder. 11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 12. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, including, without limitation, Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law. 13. Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not be affected or impaired thereby. 14. Section References. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Agreement to sections are to the sections of this Agreement. 15. Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the construction hereof. 16. Notice.
