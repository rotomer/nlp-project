Pursuant to a delegation by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Amgen Inc. (the "Company"), on November 21, 2005, the Company amended the Amgen Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective January 1, 2005) (the "Plan"). A description and the form of this amendment follow below.
 
Second Amendment to the Plan
 
The Plan was amended to incorporate certain 2005 transition rules permitted by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
Under the first transition rule, a participant may elect to revoke his or her participation in the Plan no later than December 31, 2005. If the participant elects to revoke participation, the participant's deferrals, as adjusted for earnings, will be distributed and included in the participant's taxable income in 2005. In addition, any outstanding deferral election the participant has on file for 2005, including any 2005 bonus payable in early 2006, will be cancelled. This special transition rule does not permit participants to receive a distribution of any amounts in their Plan accounts attributable to Company contributions.
 
The second transition rule incorporated in the Plan was added to reflect the Plan's operation under a special rule for 2005 deferral elections made on or before March 15, 2005. Pursuant to the transition rule, participants were permitted to revoke or revise prior 2005 deferral elections that were intended to become effective when the participant could no longer make deferrals into the Amgen Retirement Savings Plan because of IRS limits. Participants were permitted to revoke or revise their previously-elected deferral amount or to elect a specified date in 2005 for the election to take effect.
 
The amendment also added a provision that allows participants to make separate distribution elections for each year's deferrals under the Plan, effective January 1, 2005. Participants are also permitted to make a separate distribution election that will apply to all deferrals made under the Plan prior to January 1, 2005. Distribution elections for 2005 and prior deferrals must be made during the period specified by the Plan administrator, but no later than December 31, 2006.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
Article 2 of the Amgen Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2005, (the "Plan") is hereby amended by adding the following new Section 2.5 to the Plan immediately following Section 2.4 thereof:
 
 
 
 
 
To record this Second Amendment to the Plan as set forth herein, the Company has caused its Authorized Officer to execute this document this 21st day of November, 2005.
