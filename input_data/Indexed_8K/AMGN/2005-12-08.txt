Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
 
 
 
(a) The purpose of the Amended and Restated 1991 Equity Incentive Plan as amended and restated in December 2005 (the "Plan") is to provide a means by which employees or directors of and consultants to Amgen Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and its Affiliates, as defined in paragraph 1(b), directly, or indirectly through Trusts, may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the stock of the Company through the granting of (i) incentive stock options, (ii) nonqualified stock options, (iii) stock bonuses, and (iv) rights to purchase restricted stock, all as defined below. For purposes of the incentive stock option rules of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Plan is a new plan.
 
(b) The word "Affiliate" as used in the Plan means (a) any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the regulations and official guidance promulgated thereunder, the "Code") and (b) any domestic eligible entity that is disregarded, under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3, as an entity separate from either (i) the Company or (ii) any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Code.
 
(c) The Company, by means of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of persons now employed by or serving as directors or consultants to the Company, to secure and retain the services of persons capable of filling such positions, and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company.
 
(d) The Company intends that the rights issued under the Plan shall, in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") or any committee to which responsibility for administration of the Plan has been delegated pursuant to paragraph 2(c), be either (i) stock options granted pursuant to Sections 5 or 6 hereof, including incentive stock options as that term is used in Section 422 of the Code ("Incentive Stock Options"), or options which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options ("Nonqualified Stock Options") (together hereinafter referred to as "Options"), or (ii) stock bonuses or rights to purchase restricted stock granted pursuant to Section 7 hereof (all such rights included in (i) and (ii), collectively "Stock Awards").
(e) The word "Trust" as used in the Plan shall mean a trust created for the benefit of the employee, director or consultant, his or her spouse, or members of their immediate family. The word optionee shall mean the person to whom the option is granted or the employee, director or consultant for whose benefit the option is granted to a Trust, as the context shall require.
 
 
(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board unless and until the Board delegates administration to a committee, as provided in paragraph 2(c).
 
(b) The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
 
(1) To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Stock Awards; when and how Stock Awards shall be granted; whether a Stock Award will be an Incentive Stock Option, a Nonqualified Stock Option, a stock bonus, a right to purchase restricted stock, or a combination of the foregoing; the provisions of each Stock Award granted (which need not be identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase or receive stock pursuant to a Stock Award; and the number of shares with respect to which Stock Awards shall be granted to each such person.
 
(2) To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.
 
(3) To amend the Plan as provided in Section 14.
 
(4) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company.
 
(c) The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a committee composed of not fewer than two (2) members of the Board (the "Committee"). One or more of these members may be non-employee directors and outside directors, if required and as defined by the provisions of paragraphs 2(e) and 2(f). If administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board (except amendment of Section 6 or the options granted thereunder shall only be by action taken by the Board or a committee of one or more members of the Board to which such authority has been specifically delegated by the Board), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. Notwithstanding anything else in this paragraph 2(c) to the contrary, at any
 
time the Board or the Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board the authority to grant or amend Stock Awards to all employees, directors or consultants or any portion or class thereof.
 
(d) Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan to the contrary, at any time the Board or the Committee may authorize by duly adopted resolution one or more Officers (as defined below) (each a "Delegated Officer") to take the actions described in paragraph 2(b)(1) of the Plan with respect to Options only, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan; , , that a Delegated Officer shall not have the power to (1) grant any Options to himself, any non-employee director, consultant, Trust, other Delegated Officer or Officer, (2) determine the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option (i.e., vesting), (3) determine the exercise price of an Option, or (4) grant any Option to a parent corporation of the Company, as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code. The resolution authorizing a Delegated Officer to act as such shall specify the total number of shares of Common Stock that a Delegated Officer may grant with respect to Options. The exercise price, which shall be not less than 100% of the closing price of the Common Stock of the Company as quoted on the NASDAQ system on the grant date, or in the Board or the Committee's sole discretion, otherwise determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Code Section 409A (the "Option Fair Market Value") and the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall, however, be set by the Board or the Committee and not by a Delegated Officer to the extent required by Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157 or any other applicable law. The term "Officer" shall include any natural person who is elected as a corporate officer of the Company by the Board.
provided
however
 
(e) The term "non-employee director" shall mean a member of the Board who (i) is not currently an officer of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) or an employee of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company; (ii) does not receive compensation from the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company for services rendered in any capacity other than as a member of the Board (including a consultant) in an amount required to be disclosed to the Company's stockholders under Rule 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Rule 404"); (iii) does not possess an interest in any other transaction required to be disclosed under Rule 404; or (iv) is not engaged in a business relationship required to be disclosed under Rule 404, as all of these provisions are interpreted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 
(f) The term "outside director," as used in this Plan, shall mean an administrator of the Plan, whether a member of the Board or of any Committee to which responsibility for administration of the Plan has been delegated pursuant to paragraph 2(c), who is considered to be an "outside director" in accordance with the rules, regulations or interpretations of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(g) Any requirement that an administrator of the Plan be a "non-employee director" or "outside director" shall not apply if the Board or the Committee expressly declares that such requirement shall not apply.
 
 
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate One Hundred Ninety-Two Million (192,000,000) shares of the Company's $.0001 par value common stock (the "Common Stock"). If any Stock Award granted under the Plan shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, the Common Stock not purchased under such Stock Award shall again become available for the Plan. Shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to any repurchase rights reserved by the Company pursuant to the Plan shall not be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
 
(b) The Common Stock subject to the Plan may be unissued shares or reacquired shares, bought on the market or otherwise.
 
(c) An Incentive Stock Option may be granted to an eligible person under the Plan only if the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which incentive stock options (as defined by the Code) are exercisable for the first time by such optionee during any calendar year under all such plans of the Company and its Affiliates does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). If it is determined that an entire Option or any portion thereof does not qualify for treatment as an Incentive Stock Option by reason of exceeding such maximum, such Option or the applicable portion shall be considered a Nonqualified Stock Option.
 
 
(a) Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees (including officers) of the Company or its Affiliates. A director of the Company shall not be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options unless such director is also an employee of the Company or any Affiliate. Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to employees (including officers) or directors of or consultants to the Company or any Affiliate or to Trusts of any such employee, director or consultant.
 
(b) A director shall in no event be eligible for the benefits of the Plan (other than from a Director NQSO under Section 6 of the Plan) unless and until such director is expressly declared eligible to participate in the Plan by action of the Board or the Committee, and only if, at any time discretion is exercised by the Board or the Committee in the selection of a director as a person to whom Stock Awards may be granted, or in the determination of the number of shares which may be covered by Stock Awards granted to a director, the Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as from time to time in effect. The Board shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as from time to time in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this paragraph 4(b) shall not apply if the Board or Committee expressly declares that such restrictions shall not apply.
 
(c) No person shall be eligible for the grant of an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan if, at the time of grant, such person owns (or is deemed to own pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Affiliates unless the exercise price of such Incentive Stock Option is at least one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant and the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
 
(d) Stock Awards shall be limited to a maximum of 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock per person per calendar year.
 
 
An option granted pursuant to this Section 5 (a "Discretionary Stock Option") shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
 
(a) No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted.
 
(b) The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option and each Nonqualified Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Option Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted.
 
(c) The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either: (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised; or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, either at
 
the time of grant or exercise of the Option (A) by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock that have been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company's reported earnings and valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to paragraph 5(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued.
 
In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at not less than the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.
 
(d) An Option granted to a natural person shall be exercisable during the lifetime of such person only by such person, provided that such person during such person's lifetime may designate a Trust to be such person's beneficiary with respect to any Incentive Stock Options granted after February 25, 1992 and with respect to any Nonqualified Stock Options, and such beneficiary shall, after the death of the person to whom the Option was granted, have all the rights that such person has while living, including the right to exercise the Option. In the absence of such designation, after the death of the person to whom the Option is granted, the Option shall be exercisable by the person or persons to whom the optionee's rights under such Option pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
(e) The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). From time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable ("vest") with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option was not fully exercised. During the remainder of the term of the Option (if its term extends beyond the end of the installment periods), the Option may be exercised from time to time with respect to any shares then remaining subject to the Option. The provisions of this paragraph 5(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
(f) The Company may require any optionee, or any person to whom an Option is transferred under paragraph 5(d), as a condition of exercising any such Option: (i) to give
 
written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, and that such person is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Option; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the Common Stock subject to the Option for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. These requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if: (x) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise of the Option has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"); or (y) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities law.
 
(g) An Option shall terminate three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate, unless the Option by its term specifies either (i) that it shall terminate sooner than three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate; or (ii) that it may be exercised more than three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate. This paragraph 5(g) shall not be construed to extend the term of any Option or to permit anyone to exercise the Option after expiration of its term, nor shall it be construed to increase the number of shares as to which any Option is exercisable from the amount exercisable on the date of termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director.
 
(h) The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the optionee may elect at any time during the term of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or any Affiliate to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the stated vesting dates of the Option. Any shares so purchased from any unvested installment or Option may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board or the Committee determines to be appropriate.
 
(i) To the extent provided by the terms of an Option, each optionee may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise of such Option by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of the Common Stock otherwise issuable to the optionee as a result of the exercise of the Option a number of shares
 
having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the Common Stock having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
(j) Without in any way limiting the authority of the Board or Committee to make or not to make grants of Discretionary Stock Options under this Section 5, the Board or Committee shall have the authority (but not an obligation) to include as part of any Option agreement a provision entitling the optionee to a further Option (a "Re-Load Option") in the event the optionee exercises the Option evidenced by the Option agreement, in whole or in part, by surrendering other shares of Common Stock in accordance with this Plan and the terms and conditions of the Option agreement. Any such Re-Load Option (i) shall be for a number of shares equal to the number of shares surrendered as part or all of the exercise price of such Option; (ii) shall have an expiration date which is the same as the expiration date of the Option the exercise of which gave rise to such Re-Load Option; and (iii) shall have an exercise price which is equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Option Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Option or, in the case of a Re-Load Option which is an Incentive Stock Option and which is granted to a 10% stockholder (as defined in paragraph 4(c)), shall have an exercise price which is equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Option Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Option.
 
Any such Re-Load Option may be an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option, as the Board or Committee may designate at the time of the grant of the original Option, provided, however, that the designation of any Re-Load Option as an Incentive Stock Option shall be subject to the one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) annual limitation on exercisability of Incentive Stock Options described in paragraph 3(c) of the Plan and in Section 422(d) of the Code. There shall be no Re-Load Option on a Re-Load Option. Any such Re-Load Option shall be subject to the availability of sufficient shares under paragraph 3(a) and shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Board or Committee may determine.
 
 
(a) Prior to December 9, 2003, on January 27 of each year, each person who is at that time an Eligible Director of the Company, (as defined in paragraph 6(k)), shall automatically be granted under the Plan, without further action by the Company, the Board, or the Company's stockholders, a Nonqualified Stock Option (a "Director NQSO") to purchase sixteen thousand (16,000) shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth
 
herein. An Eligible Director may designate that such Director NQSO be granted in the name of a Trust instead of in the name of such Eligible Director. The Director NQSO shall be on the terms and conditions set forth herein and should the date of grant set forth above be a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, such grant shall be made on the next business day. Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan to the contrary, this paragraph 6(a) shall be of no force and effect from and after December 9, 2003.
 
(b) Prior to December 9, 2003, each person who becomes an Eligible Director, shall, upon the date such person first becomes an Eligible Director, automatically be granted under the Plan, without further action by the Company, the Board, or the Company's stockholders, a Director NQSO to purchase sixty thousand (60,000) shares of Common Stock on the terms and conditions set forth herein. An Eligible Director may designate that such Director NQSO be granted in the name of a Trust instead of in the name of such Eligible Director. The Director NQSO shall be on the terms and conditions set forth herein and should the date of grant set forth above be a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, such grant shall be made on the next business day. Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan to the contrary, this paragraph 6(b) shall be of no force and effect from and after December 9, 2003.
 
(c) Each Director NQSO granted pursuant to this Section 6 (or any Director Re-Load Option granted pursuant to paragraph 6(j)) shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Director NQSO's need not be identical, but each Director NQSO shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Director NQSO or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as set forth in paragraphs 6(d) through 6(j), inclusive.
 
(d) The term of each Director NQSO shall be ten (10) years from the date it was granted.
 
(e) The exercise price of each Director NQSO shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the Option Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to such Director NQSO on the date such Director NQSO is granted.
 
(f) The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to a Director NQSO shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the Director NQSO is exercised; (ii) by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock that have been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company's reported earnings and valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise; or (iii) pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instructions to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued.
 
(g) A Director NQSO shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Eligible Director with respect to whom it was granted only by the person to whom it was granted (whether the Eligible Director or a Trust), provided that such person during the Eligible Director's lifetime may designate a Trust to be a beneficiary with respect to the Director NQSO, and such beneficiary shall, after the death of the Eligible Director to whom the Director NQSO was granted, have all of the rights designated for such beneficiary. In the absence of such designation, after the death of the Eligible Director with respect to whom the Director NQSO was granted, if such Director NQSO was granted to the Eligible Director, the Director NQSO shall be exercisable by the person or persons to whom the optionee's rights under such option pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
(h) A Director NQSO shall not vest with respect to an Eligible Director, or the affiliate of such Eligible Director, as the case may be, (i) unless the Eligible Director, has, at the date of grant, provided three (3) years of prior continuous service as an Eligible Director, or (ii) until the date upon which such Eligible Director has provided one year of continuous service as an Eligible Director following the date of grant of such Director NQSO, whereupon such Director NQSO shall become fully vested and exercisable in accordance with its terms.
 
(i) The Company may require any optionee under this Section 6, or any person to whom a Director NQSO is transferred under paragraph 6(g), as a condition of exercising any such option: (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, and that such person is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Director NQSO; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the Common Stock subject to the Director NQSO for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock. These requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (i) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise of the Director NQSO has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or (ii), as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws.
 
(j) Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph 6(j), each Director NQSO shall include a provision entitling the optionee to a further Nonqualified Stock Option (a "Director Re-Load Option") in the event the optionee exercises the Director NQSO evidenced by the Director NQSO grant, in whole or in part, by surrendering other shares of Common
 
Stock in accordance with the Plan and the terms of the Director NQSO grant. Any such Director Re-Load Option (i) shall be for a number of shares equal to the number of shares surrendered as part or all of the exercise price of the original Director NQSO; (ii) shall have an expiration date which is the same as the expiration date of the original Director NQSO; and (iii) shall have an exercise price which is equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Option Fair Market Value of the Common Stock subject to the Director Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Director NQSO. Any such Director Re-Load Option shall be subject to the availability of sufficient shares under paragraph 3(a). There shall be no Director Re-Load Option on a Director Re-Load Option. Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan to the contrary, this paragraph 6(j) shall be of no force and effect from and after June 23, 1998.
 
(k) For purposes of this Section 6, the term "Eligible Director" shall mean a member of the Board who is not an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, and the term "affiliate" shall mean a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Eligible Director.
 
 
Each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as appropriate:
 
(a) The purchase price under each stock purchase agreement shall be such amount as the Board or Committee shall determine and designate in such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may determine that eligible participants in the Plan may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement or stock purchase agreement in consideration for future services to be rendered or past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(b) No rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be assignable by any participant under the Plan, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except where such assignment is required by law or expressly authorized by the terms of the applicable stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement.
 
(c) The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement shall be paid either: (i) in cash at the time of purchase; (ii) at the discretion of the
 
Board or the Committee, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Common Stock is sold; or (iii) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price of the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee to which administration of the Plan has been delegated may award Common Stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement or stock purchase agreement in consideration for future services to be rendered or past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(d) Shares of Common Stock sold or awarded under the Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board or the Committee.
 
(e) In the event a person ceases to be an employee of or ceases to serve as a director or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate, the Company may repurchase or otherwise reacquire any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by that person which have not vested as of the date of termination under the terms of the stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement between the Company and such person.
 
(f) To the extent provided by the terms of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement, a participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the lapsing of a repurchase option in favor of the Company or vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of the Common Stock otherwise deliverable to a participant as a result of the lapsing of a repurchase option in favor of the Company or the vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award a number of shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the Common Stock having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
 
(a) During the terms of the Stock Awards granted under the Plan, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards up to the number of shares of Common Stock authorized under the Plan.
 
(b) The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of Common Stock under the Stock Awards granted under the Plan; provided, however, that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act either the Plan, any Stock Award granted under the Plan or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.
 
 
Proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company.
 
 
(a) The Board or Committee shall have the power to accelerate the time during which a Stock Award may be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest, notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time during which it may be exercised or the time during which it will vest. Each Discretionary Stock Option providing for vesting pursuant to paragraph 5(e) may also provide that if the employee's employment or a director's or consultant's affiliation with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is terminated by reason of death or disability, then the vesting schedule of Discretionary Stock Options granted to such employee, director or consultant or to the Trusts of such employee, director or consultant may be accelerated.
 
(b) Neither an optionee nor any person to whom an Option is transferred under the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Option unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Option pursuant to its terms.
 
(c) Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any eligible employee, consultant, director, optionee or holder of Stock Awards under the Plan any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate or to continue acting as a consultant or director or shall affect the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment or consulting relationship or directorship of any eligible employee, consultant, director, optionee or holder of Stock Awards under the Plan with or without cause. In the event that a holder of Stock Awards under the Plan
 
is permitted or otherwise entitled to take a leave of absence, the Company shall have the unilateral right to (i) determine whether such leave of absence will be treated as a termination of employment or relationship as consultant or director for purposes hereof, and (ii) suspend or otherwise delay the time or times at which exercisability or vesting would otherwise occur with respect to any outstanding Stock Awards under the Plan.
 
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Board or the Committee shall have the power to condition the grant or vesting of stock bonuses and rights to purchase restricted stock under the Plan upon the attainment of performance goals, determined by the Board or the Committee in their respective sole discretion, with respect to any one or more of the following business criteria with respect to the Company, any Affiliate, any division, any operating unit or any product line: (i) return on capital, assets or equity, (ii) sales or revenue, (iii) net income, (iv) cash flow, (v) earnings per share, (vi) adjusted earnings or adjusted net income as defined below, (vii) working capital, (vii) total shareholder return, (ix) economic value or (x) product development, research, in-licensing, out-licensing, litigation, human resources, information services, manufacturing, manufacturing capacity, production, inventory, site development, plant, building or facility development, government relations, product market share, mergers, acquisitions or sales of assets or subsidiaries. "Adjusted net income" and "adjusted earnings" shall mean net income or earnings, as the case may be, for the relevant performance period computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. which may be adjusted by the Committee, as specified in writing, for such performance period, at the time a performance goal is established for the performance period, for the following: (a) any item of significant gain or loss for the performance period determined to be related to a change in accounting principle as reflected in the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, (b) amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets, (c) expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development and (d) any other items of significant income or expense which are determined to be appropriate adjustments and are specified in writing by the Committee at the time the goal is established for the performance period. With respect to any stock bonuses or rights to purchase restricted stock granted to persons who are or who may be "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board or the Committee shall have the power to grant such awards upon terms and conditions that qualify such awards as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. Stock bonuses and rights to purchase restricted stock made in accordance with this paragraph 10(d) shall contain the terms and conditions of Section 7 above.
 
 
If any change is made in the Common Stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award granted under the Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan and outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the Plan, the maximum number of shares which may be granted to a participant in a calendar year, the class(es) and number of shares and price per share of stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be granted as provided for in paragraphs 6(a) and 6(b). Such adjustment shall be made by the Board or the Committee, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a "transaction not involving the receipt of consideration".) The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may accomplish any such adjustment in a manner calculated not to constitute a "modification" of any such Stock Awards (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) that would cause any such Stock Award to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).
 
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), then, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) the time during which Stock Awards become vested shall automatically be accelerated so that the unvested portions of all Stock Awards shall be vested prior to the Change in Control and (ii) the time during which the Options may be exercised shall automatically be accelerated to prior to the Change in Control. Upon and following the acceleration of the vesting and exercise periods, at the election of the holder of the Stock Award, the Stock Award may be: (x) exercised (with respect to Options) or, if the surviving or acquiring corporation agrees to assume the Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards, (y) assumed; or (z) replaced with substitute stock awards. Options not exercised, substituted or assumed prior to or upon the Change in Control shall be terminated. The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause any such assumption or substitution to be conducted in a manner so as not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any such Stock Award that would cause any such Stock Award to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).
 
(b) For purposes of the Plan, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred at any of the following times:
 
(i) upon the acquisition (other than from the Company) by any person, entity or "group," within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (excluding, for this purpose, the Company or its affiliates, or any employee benefit plan of the Company or its affiliates which acquires beneficial ownership of voting securities of the Company), of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of fifty percent (50%) or more of either the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or
 
(ii) at the time individuals who, as of April 2, 1991, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to April 2, 1991, whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the Directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of the Plan, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; or
 
(iii) immediately prior to the consummation by the Company of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, (in each case, with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, own more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company's then outstanding voting securities) or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
 
(iv) the occurrence of any other event which the Incumbent Board in its sole discretion determines constitutes a Change of Control.
 
 
(a) Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, rights under Stock Awards may be assigned to an Alternate Payee to the extent that a QDRO so provides. (The terms "Alternate Payee" and "QDRO" are defined in paragraph 13(c) below.) The assignment of a Stock Award to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO shall not be treated as having caused a new grant. The transfer of an Incentive Stock Option to an Alternate Payee may,
 
however, cause it to fail to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. If a Stock Award is assigned to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee generally has the same rights as the grantee under the terms of the Plan; provided however, that (i) the Stock Award shall be subject to the same vesting terms and exercise period as if the Stock Award were still held by the grantee, (ii) an Alternate Payee may not transfer a Stock Award and (iii) an Alternate Payee is ineligible for Re-Load Options described at paragraph 5(j) or Director Re-Load Options described at paragraph 6(j).
 
(b) In the event of the Plan administrator's receipt of a domestic relations order or other notice of adverse claim by an Alternate Payee of a grantee of a Stock Award, transfer of the proceeds of the exercise of such Stock Award, whether in the form of cash, stock or other property, may be suspended. Such proceeds shall thereafter be transferred pursuant to the terms of a QDRO or other agreement between the grantee and Alternate Payee. A grantee's ability to exercise a Stock Award may be barred if the Plan administrator receives a court order directing the Plan administrator not to permit exercise.
 
(c) The word "QDRO" as used in the Plan shall mean a court order (i) that creates or recognizes the right of the spouse, former spouse or child (an "Alternate Payee") of an individual who is granted a Stock Award to an interest in such Stock Award relating to marital property rights or support obligations and (ii) that the administrator of the Plan determines would be a "qualified domestic relations order," as that term is defined in section 414(p) of the Code and section 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), but for the fact that the Plan is not a plan described in section 3(3) of ERISA.
 
 
(a) The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan. However, except as provided in Section 10 relating to adjustments upon changes in the Common Stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or after the adoption of the amendment, where the amendment will:
 
(i) increase the number of shares reserved for Stock Awards under the Plan;
 
(ii) modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan (to the extent such modification requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code); or
 
(iii) modify the Plan in any other way if such modification requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code.
 
(b) The Board may in its sole discretion submit any other amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation to certain executive officers.
 
(c) It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide optionees with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to employee Incentive Stock Options and/or to bring the Plan and/or Options granted under it into compliance therewith.
 
(d) Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by any amendment of the Plan, unless: (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted; and (ii) such person consents in writing.
 
(e) Any amendment of the Plan may be accomplished in a manner calculated to cause such amendment not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any Stock Awards that would cause such Stock Awards to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Board or the Committee determines that any Stock Award may be subject to Code Section 409A, the Board or the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and without a Participant's prior consent to amend the Plan or any Stock Award as it may determine is necessary or desirable either for the Plan and Stock Awards to be exempt from the application of Section 409A or to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, including by adding conditions with respect to the vesting and/or the payment of the Stock Awards.
 
 
(a) The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. No Incentive Stock Options may be granted under the Plan after February 22, 2009.
 
(b) Rights and obligations under any Stock Awards granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.
 
 
The Plan shall become effective as determined by the Board.
 
 
Except as may be expressly provided with respect to any Stock Award granted under the Plan, the Plan and the Stock Awards are not intended to constitute a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, but rather are intended to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Plan and/or Stock Awards are nevertheless deemed to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Plan and Stock Awards shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the grant of any Stock Award. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Stock Award to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any Stock Award may be or become subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the affected Stock Award (as described above) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Plan and any Stock Award from the application of Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Stock Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Article I, Section 12 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, shares of common stock of the Company shall be available for issuance under the Plan.
 
(b) If any Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, the stock not acquired under such Stock Award shall revert to and again become available for issuance under Article II of the Plan.
 
(c) For purposes of Article I, Section 4(a), except as to forfeited shares, the payment of cash dividends and dividend equivalents in conjunction with outstanding awards shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance.
 
 
(a) Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees, Directors or Consultants.
 
(b) Prior to the Listing Date no person shall be eligible for the grant of an Option or an award to purchase restricted stock if, at the time of grant, such person owns (or is deemed to own pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Affiliates unless the exercise price of such Option is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of such stock at the date of grant and the Option is not exercisable after
 
the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant or, in the case of a restricted stock purchase award, the purchase price is at least one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of such stock at the date of grant. After the Listing Date this provision shall apply only to Incentive Stock Options.
 
(c) Subject to the provisions of Article I, Section 12 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, no person shall be eligible to be granted Options covering more than one million (1,000,000) shares of the Company's common stock in any calendar year. This Article I, subsection 5(c) shall not apply prior to the Listing Date and, following the Listing Date, shall not apply until (i) the earliest of: (A) the first material modification of the Plan (including any increase to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan in accordance with Article I, Section 4); (B) the issuance of all of the shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan; (C) the expiration of the Plan; or (D) the first meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs after the close of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which occurred the first registration of an equity security under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or (ii) such other date required by Section 162(m) of the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 
 
Each Option shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
 
(a). No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted.
Term
 
(b). The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted; the exercise price of each Nonstatutory Stock Option shall be not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option (whether an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option) may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth in the preceding sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code.
Price
 
(c). The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, at the time of the grant of the Option, (A) by delivery to the Company of shares of common stock of the Company that have been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company's
Consideration
 
reported earnings and valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement (however, in the event the Company reincorporates in Delaware, then payment of the common stock's "par value" (as defined in the Delaware General Corporation Law) shall not be made by deferred payment) with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to Article I, subsection 6(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds before stock is issued.
 
In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at no less than the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.
 
(d) . Prior to the Listing Date, an Option shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the person to whom the Option is granted only by such person. A Nonstatutory Stock Option, but not an Incentive Stock Option, that is granted after the Listing Date may be transferable to the extent provided in the Option Agreement. The person to whom the Option is granted may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of the death of the Optionee, shall thereafter be entitled to exercise the Option.
Transferability
 
(e) . The total number of shares of stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). The Option Agreement may provide that, from time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable ("vest") with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option became vested but was not fully exercised. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate. Prior to the Listing Date, the vesting provisions of individual Options may vary but in each case will provide for vesting of at least twenty percent (20%) per year of the total number of shares subject to the Option; , , that an Option granted to an officer, director or consultant (within the meaning of Section 260.140.41 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations) may become fully exercisable, subject to reasonable conditions such as continued employment, at any time or during any period established by the Company or of any of its

Affiliates. The provisions of this Article I, subsection 6(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
(f) . In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability), the Optionee may exercise the Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it as of the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date three (3) months following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant (or such longer or shorter period, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days unless such termination is for cause, specified in the Option Agreement) or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise the entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise the Option within the time specified in the Option Agreement, the Option shall terminate and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
Termination of Employment or Relationship as a Director or Consultant
 
An Optionee's Option Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director, or Consultant (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability) would result in liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in the Option Agreement or (ii) the tenth (10th) day after the last date on which such exercise would result in such liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Finally, an Optionee's Option Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant (other than upon the Optionee's death or disability) would be prohibited at any time solely because the issuance of shares would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of the Option set forth in the first paragraph of this Article I, subsection 6(f) or (ii) the expiration of a period of three (3) months after the termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such registration requirements.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in the Plan or any Stock Award Agreement to the contrary but subject to Sections 13(d) and (e), the Board, in its sole discretion, may provide, by Board action or otherwise, an Optionee with the right to continue to vest in an Option for a certain period of time following the date the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates ("Continued Vesting Period"), as determined by the Board, and to exercise such Option during such Continued Vesting Period and for a certain
 
period of time following such Continued Vesting Period, as determined by the Board; that no Option may be exercised after the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement.
provided, however,
 
(g) . In the event an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates as a result of the Optionee's disability, the Optionee may exercise the Option (to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it as of the date of termination), but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months following such termination (or such longer or shorter period, which prior to the Listing Date shall not be less than six (6) months, specified in the Option Agreement) or (ii) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to exercise the entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise the Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
Disability of Optionee
 
(h) . In the event of the death of an Optionee during, or within a period specified in the Option Agreement after the termination of, the Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant, the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option as of the date of death) by the Optionee's estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the option upon the Optionee's death pursuant to Article I, subsection 6(d), but only within the period ending on the earlier of (i) the date eighteen (18) months following the date of death (or such longer or shorter period, which prior to the Listing Date shall not be less than six (6) months, specified in the Option Agreement) or (ii) the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement. If, at the time of death, the Optionee was not entitled to exercise the entire Option, the shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan. If, after death, the Option is not exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the shares covered by such Option shall revert to and again become available for issuance under the Plan.
Death of Optionee
 
(i) . The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Optionee may elect at any time while an Employee, Director or Consultant to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option. Any unvested shares so purchased may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate. Prior to the Listing Date, however, any unvested shares so purchased shall be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company, with the repurchase price to be equal to the original purchase

price of the stock, or to any other restriction the Board determines to be appropriate; , , that (i) the right to repurchase at the original purchase price shall lapse at a minimum rate of twenty percent (20%) per year over five (5) years from the date the Option was granted, (ii) such right shall be exercisable only within (A) the ninety (90) day period following the termination of employment or the relationship as a Director or Consultant, or (B) such longer period as may be agreed to by the Company and the Optionee (for example, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Section 1202(c)(3) of the Code (regarding "qualified small business stock")) and (iii) such right shall be exercisable only for cash or cancellation of purchase money indebtedness for the shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares received on exercise of an Option by an officer, director or consultant (within the meaning of Section 260.140.41 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations) may be subject to additional or greater restrictions.
provided
however
 
(j) . The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the Company may elect, prior to the Listing Date, to exercise a right of first refusal following receipt of notice from the Optionee of the intent to transfer all or any part of the shares exercised pursuant to the Option. Such right of first refusal shall be exercised by the Company no more than thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of the Optionee's intent to transfer shares and must be exercised as to all the shares the Optionee intends to transfer unless the Optionee consents to exercise for less than all the shares offered. The purchase of the shares following exercise shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the Company's receipt of notice of the Optionee's intent to transfer shares, or such longer period of time as has been offered by the person to whom the Optionee intends to transfer the shares, or as may be agreed to by the Company and the Optionee (for example, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Section 1202(c)(3) of the Code (regarding "qualified small business stock")).
Right of First Refusal
 
(k) . Without in any way limiting the authority of the Board or Committee to make or not to make grants of Options hereunder, the Board or Committee shall have the authority (but not an obligation) to include as part of any Option Agreement a provision entitling the Optionee to a further Option (a "Re-Load Option") in the event the Optionee exercises the Option evidenced by the Option Agreement, in whole or in part, by surrendering other shares of common stock in accordance with the Plan and the terms and conditions of the Option Agreement. Any such Re-Load Option: (i) shall be for a number of shares equal to the number of shares surrendered as part or all of the exercise price of such Option; (ii) shall have an expiration date which is the same as the expiration date of the Option the exercise of which gave rise to such Re-Load Option; and (iii) shall have an exercise price which is equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the common stock subject to the Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Re-Load Option which is granted to a 10% stockholder (as described in Article I, subsection 5(b)), shall have an
Re-Load Options
 
exercise price which is equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Re-Load Option on the date of exercise of the original Option and shall have a term which is no longer than five (5) years.
 
Any such Re-Load Option may be an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option, as the Board or Committee may designate at the time of the grant of the original Option; , , that the designation of any Re-Load Option as an Incentive Stock Option shall be subject to the one hundred thousand dollar ($100,000) annual limitation on exercisability of Incentive Stock Options described in Article I, subsection 11(e) and in Section 422(d) of the Code. There shall be no Re-Load Options on a Re-Load Option. Any such Re-Load Option shall be subject to the availability of sufficient shares under Article I, subsection 4(a) and the limits on the grants of Options under Article I, subsection 5(c) and shall be subject to such other terms and conditions as the Board or Committee may determine which are not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan regarding the terms of Options.

Each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as appropriate:
 
(a) . The purchase price under each restricted stock purchase agreement shall be such amount as the Board or Committee shall determine and designate in such Stock Award Agreement, but prior to the Listing Date the purchase price shall not be less than eighty-five percent (85%), and after the Listing Date the purchase price shall not be less than fifty percent (50%), of the stock's Fair Market Value on the date such award is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may determine that eligible participants in the Plan may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
Purchase Price
 
(b) . Rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be transferable only by will or the laws of descent and distribution, so long as stock awarded under such Stock Award Agreement remains subject to the terms of the agreement.
Transferability
 
(c) . The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement shall be paid either: (i) in cash at the time of purchase; (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement (however,

in the event the Company reincorporates in Delaware, then payment of the common stock's "par value" (as defined in the Delaware General Corporation Law) shall not be made by deferred payment) with the person to whom the stock is sold; or (iii) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price of the Company from the sales proceeds before stock is issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee to which administration of the Plan has been delegated may award stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(d) . Shares of stock sold or awarded under the Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board or the Committee. Prior to the Listing Date, the applicable agreement shall provide (i) that the right to repurchase at the original purchase price shall lapse at a minimum rate of twenty percent (20%) per year over five (5) years from the date the Stock Award was granted (except that a Stock Award granted to an officer, director or consultant (within the meaning of Section 260.140.41 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations) may become fully vested, subject to reasonable conditions such as continued employment, at any time or during any period established by the Company or of any of its Affiliates), (ii) such right shall be exercisable only (A) within the ninety (90) day period following the termination of employment or the relationship as a Director or Consultant, or (B) such longer period as may be agreed to by the Company and the holder of the Stock Award (for example, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of Section 1202(c)(3) of the Code (regarding "qualified small business stock")) and (iii) such right shall be exercisable only for cash or cancellation of purchase money indebtedness for the shares.
Vesting
 
(e) . In the event a Participant's Continuous Status as an Employee, Director or Consultant terminates, the Company may repurchase or otherwise reacquire, subject to the limitations described in Article I, subsection 7(d), any or all of the shares of stock held by that person which have not vested as of the date of termination under the terms of the stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement between the Company and such person.
Termination of Employment or Relationship as a Director or Consultant
 
 
 
(a) During the terms of the Stock Awards, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards.
 
(b) The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of stock upon exercise of the Stock Award; , , that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act either the Plan, any Stock Award or any stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.
provided
however
 
 
Proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to Stock Awards shall constitute general funds of the Company.
 
 
(a) Subject to any applicable provisions of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968 and related regulations relied upon prior to the Listing Date as a condition of issuing securities pursuant to the Plan, the Board shall have the power to accelerate the time at which a Stock Award may first be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest pursuant to Article I, subsection 6(e) or 7(d), notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest.
 
(b) Neither an Employee, Director or Consultant nor any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred under Article I, subsection 6(d) or 7(b) shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Stock Award unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Stock Award pursuant to its terms.
 
(c) Throughout the term of any Stock Award, the Company shall deliver to the holder of such Stock Award, not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each of the Company's fiscal years during the term of such Stock Award, a balance sheet and an income statement. This subsection shall not apply (i) after the Listing Date or (ii) when issuance is limited to key employees whose duties in connection with the Company assure them access to equivalent information.
 
(d) Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any Employee, Director, Consultant or other holder of Stock Awards any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate (or to continue acting as a Director or Consultant) or shall affect the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of any Employee with or without cause the right of the Company's
 
Board of Directors and/or the Company's stockholders to remove any Director as provided in the Company's Bylaws and the provisions of the applicable laws of the Company's state of incorporation or the right to terminate the relationship of any Consultant subject to the terms of such Consultant's agreement with the Company or Affiliate.
 
(e) To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year under all plans of the Company and its Affiliates exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the Options or portions thereof which exceed such limit (according to the order in which they were granted) shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.
 
(f) The Company may require any person to whom a Stock Award is granted, or any person to whom a Stock Award is transferred pursuant to Article I, subsection 6(d) or 7(b), as a condition of exercising or acquiring stock under any Stock Award: (1) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative reasonably satisfactory to the Company who is knowledgeable and experienced in financial and business matters, and that he or she is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Stock Award; and (2) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the stock subject to the Stock Award for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the stock. The foregoing requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if (i) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act or (ii) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities laws. The Company may, upon advice of counsel to the Company, place legends on stock certificates issued under the Plan as such counsel deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with applicable securities laws, including, but not limited to, legends restricting the transfer of the stock.
 
(g) To the extent provided by the terms of a Stock Award Agreement, the person to whom a Stock Award is granted may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of stock under a Stock Award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (1) tendering a cash payment; (2) authorizing the Company to withhold shares from the shares of the common stock otherwise issuable to the participant as a result of the exercise or acquisition of stock under the Stock Award having a Fair Market Value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (3) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered
 
shares of the common stock of the Company having a Fair Market Value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
 
(a) If any change is made in the stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan will be appropriately adjusted in the type(s) of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Article I, subsection 4(a) and the outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the type(s) and number of securities and price per share of stock subject to such outstanding Stock Awards. Such adjustments shall be made by the Board or the Committee, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a "transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company".)
 
(b) In the event of: (1) a dissolution, liquidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; (2) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation; (3) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation but the shares of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise; (4) after the Listing Date the acquisition by any person, entity or group within the meaning of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act, or any comparable successor provisions (excluding any employee benefit plan, or related trust, sponsored or maintained by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company) of the beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or comparable successor rule) of securities of the Company representing at least fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors; or (5) at the time individuals who, as of the first date as of which the Company has a class of equity securities which are actively traded on any established stock exchange or a national market system (including NASDAQ), constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to such date, whose election or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of Directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of the Plan, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board, then: (i) any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation shall assume any Stock Awards outstanding under
 
the Plan or shall substitute similar stock awards (including an award to acquire the same consideration paid to the stockholders in the transaction described in this Article I, subsection 12(b)) for those outstanding under the Plan; or (ii) in the event any surviving corporation or acquiring corporation refuses to assume such Stock Awards or to substitute similar stock awards for those outstanding under the Plan, (A) with respect to Stock Awards held by persons then performing services as Employees, Directors or Consultants and subject to any applicable provisions of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968 and related regulations relied upon as a condition of issuing securities pursuant to the Plan, the vesting of such Stock Awards (and, if applicable, the time during which such Stock Awards may be exercised) shall be accelerated prior to such event and the Stock Awards terminated if not exercised (if applicable) after such acceleration and at or prior to such event, and (B) with respect to any other Stock Awards outstanding under the Plan, such Stock Awards shall be terminated if not exercised (if applicable) prior to such event.
 
 
(a) Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, rights under Stock Awards may be assigned to an Alternate Payee to the extent that a QDRO so provides. (The terms "Alternate Payee" and "QDRO" are defined in Article I, subsection 13(c) below.) The assignment of a Stock Award to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO shall not be treated as having caused a new grant. The transfer of an Incentive Stock Option to an Alternate Payee may, however, cause it to fail to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. If a Stock Award is assigned to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee generally has the same rights as the grantee under the terms of the Plan; , , that (i) the Stock Award shall be subject to the same vesting terms and exercise period as if the Stock Award were still held by the grantee, and (ii) an Alternate Payee may not transfer a Stock Award.

(b) In the event of the Plan administrator's receipt of a domestic relations order or other notice of adverse claim by an Alternate Payee of a grantee of a Stock Award, transfer of the proceeds of the exercise of such Stock Award, whether in the form of cash, stock or other property, may be suspended. Such proceeds shall thereafter be transferred pursuant to the terms of a QDRO or other agreement between the grantee and Alternate Payee. A grantee's ability to exercise a Stock Award may be barred if the Plan administrator receives a court order directing the Plan administrator not to permit exercise.
 
(c) The word "QDRO" as used in Article I of the Plan shall mean a court order (i) that creates or recognizes the right of the spouse, former spouse or child (an "Alternate Payee") of an individual who is granted a Stock Award to an interest in such Stock Award relating to marital property rights or support obligations and (ii) that the administrator of the Plan determines would be a "qualified domestic relations order," as that term is defined in Section 414(p) of the Code and Section 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), but for the fact that the Plan is not a plan described in Section 3(3) of ERISA.
 
 
(a) Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by any amendment of the Plan unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted and (ii) such person consents in writing.
 
(b) The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the terms of any one or more Stock Award; , , that the rights and obligations under any Stock Award shall not be impaired by any such amendment unless (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted and (ii) such person consents in writing.

(a) The purpose of Article II of the Plan is to provide a means by which employees or directors of and consultants to Amgen Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and its Affiliates, as defined in Article II, subsection 1(b), directly, or indirectly through Trusts, may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the stock of the Company through the granting of (i) incentive stock options, (ii) nonqualified stock options, (iii) stock bonuses, and (iv) rights to purchase restricted stock, all as defined below.
 
(b) The word "Affiliate" as used in Article II of the Plan means (i) any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the regulations and other official guidance promulgated thereunder, the "Code"), or (ii) any domestic eligible entity that is disregarded under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3, as an entity separate from either (I) the Company or (II) any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Code.
 
(c) The Company, by means of Article II of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of persons now employed by or serving as directors or consultants to the Company, to secure and retain the services of persons capable of filling such positions, and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company.
 
(d) The Company intends that the rights issued under Article II of the Plan shall, in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") or any committee to which responsibility for administration of the Plan has been delegated pursuant to Article II, subsection 2(c), be either (i) stock options granted pursuant to Article II, Sections 5 or 6 hereof, including incentive stock options as that term is used in Section 422 of the Code ("Incentive Stock Options"), or options which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options ("Nonqualified Stock Options") (together hereinafter referred to as "Options"), or (ii) stock bonuses or rights to purchase restricted stock granted pursuant to Article II, Section 7 hereof (all such rights included in (i) and (ii), collectively "Stock Awards").
 
(e) The word "Trust" as used in Article II of the Plan shall mean a trust created for the benefit of the employee, director or consultant, his or her spouse, or members of their immediate family. The word optionee shall mean the person to whom the option is granted or the employee, director or consultant for whose benefit the option is granted to a Trust, as the context shall require.
 
 
(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board unless and until the Board delegates administration to a committee, as provided in Article II, subsection 2(c).
 
(b) The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
 
(1) To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Stock Awards; when and how Stock Awards shall be granted; whether a Stock Award will be an Incentive Stock Option, a Nonqualified Stock Option, a stock bonus, a right to purchase restricted stock, or a combination of the foregoing; the provisions of each Stock Award granted (which need not be identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase or receive stock pursuant to a Stock Award; and the number of shares with respect to which Stock Awards shall be granted to each such person.
 
(2) To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.
 
(3) To amend the Plan as provided in Article II, Section 14.
 
(4) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company.
 
(c) The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a committee composed of not fewer than two (2) members of the Board (the "Committee"). One or more of these members may be non-employee directors and outside directors, if required and as defined by the provisions of Article II, subsections 2(e) and 2(f). If administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board (except amendment of any program adopted pursuant to Article II, Section 6 or any Non-Discretionary Director Awards granted thereunder shall only be by action taken by the Board or a committee of one or more members of the Board to which such authority has been specifically delegated by the Board), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of Article II of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. Notwithstanding anything else in this Article II, subsection 2(c) to the contrary, at any time the Board or the Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more
 
members of the Board the authority to grant or amend Stock Awards to all employees, directors or consultants or any portion or class thereof.
 
(d) Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan to the contrary, at any time the Board or the Committee may authorize by duly adopted resolution one or more Officers (as defined below) (each a "Delegated Officer") to take the actions described in Article II, subsection 2(b)(1) of the Plan with respect to Options only, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of Article II of the Plan; , , that a Delegated Officer shall not have the power to (1) grant any Options to himself, any non-employee director, consultant, Trust, other Delegated Officer or Officer, (2) determine the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option (i.e., vesting), (3) determine the exercise price of an Option, or (4) grant any Option to a parent corporation of the Company, as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code. The resolution authorizing a Delegated Officer to act as such shall specify the total number of shares of Common Stock that a Delegated Officer may grant with respect to Options. The exercise price, which shall be not less than 100% of the closing price of the Common Stock of the Company as quoted on the NASDAQ system on the grant date, or in the Board or the Committee's sole discretion, otherwise determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Code Section 409A (the "Option Fair Market Value") and the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall, however, be set by the Board or the Committee and not by a Delegated Officer to the extent required by Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157 or any other applicable law. The term "Officer" shall include any natural person who is elected as a corporate officer of the Company by the Board.
provided
however
 
(e) The term "non-employee director" shall mean a member of the Board who (i) is not currently an officer of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) or an employee of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company; (ii) does not receive compensation from the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company for services rendered in any capacity other than as a member of the Board (including a consultant) in an amount required to be disclosed to the Company's stockholders under Rule 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Rule 404"); (iii) does not possess an interest in any other transaction required to be disclosed under Rule 404; or (iv) is not engaged in a business relationship required to be disclosed under Rule 404, as all of these provisions are interpreted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 
(f) The term "outside director," as used in Article II of the Plan, shall mean an administrator of the Plan, whether a member of the Board or of any Committee to which
 
responsibility for administration of the Plan has been delegated pursuant to Article II, subsection 2(c), who is considered to be an "outside director" in accordance with the rules, regulations or interpretations of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(g) Any requirement that an administrator of the Plan be a "non-employee director" or "outside director" shall not apply if the Board or the Committee expressly declares that such requirement shall not apply.
 
 
(a) Subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan after the Effective Time shall not exceed in the aggregate 1,153,152 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock"), plus any forfeited shares and any shares which revert to and become available for issuance under Article II of the Plan pursuant to Article I, subsection 4(b). For purposes of this Article II, subsection 3(a), "forfeited shares" means any shares issued pursuant to Stock Awards made under the Plan which are forfeited to the Company pursuant to the Stock Award's terms and conditions; , , that the term "forfeited shares" shall not include shares as to which the original recipient received any benefits of ownership (other than voting rights).
provided
however
 
(b) If any Stock Award shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate, in whole or in part, without having been exercised in full, the Common Stock not acquired under such Stock Award shall revert to and again become available for issuance under Article II of the Plan.
 
(c) For purposes of Article II, subsection 3(a), except as to forfeited shares, the payment of cash dividends and dividend equivalents in conjunction with outstanding awards shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance.
 
(d) An Incentive Stock Option may be granted to an eligible person under the Plan only if the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which incentive stock options (as defined by the Code) are exercisable for the first time by such optionee during any calendar year under all such plans of the Company and its Affiliates does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). If it is determined that an entire Option or any portion thereof does not qualify for treatment as an Incentive Stock Option by reason of exceeding such maximum, such Option or the applicable portion shall be considered a Nonqualified Stock Option. In no event, however, except as adjusted pursuant to Article II, Section 11, shall be more than 902,006 of the shares eligible for issuance under the Plan in any calendar year be issued upon exercise of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Incentive Stock Options shall be granted under Article II of the Plan unless the Company's stockholders approve the Plan within twelve months after the Restatement Date.
 
 
(a) Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees (including officers) of the Company or its Affiliates. A director of the Company shall not be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options unless such director is also an employee of the Company or any Affiliate. Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to employees (including officers) or directors of or consultants to the Company or any Affiliate or to Trusts of any such employee, director or consultant. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Stock Award may be granted to any person who is an employee or director of or consultant to the Company or its Affiliates (other than Tularik Inc.) on the Restatement Date.
 
(b) A director shall in no event be eligible for the benefits of the Plan (other than Non-Discretionary Director Awards, as defined in Article II, Section 6) unless and until such director is expressly declared eligible to participate in the Plan by action of the Board or the Committee, and only if, at any time discretion is exercised by the Board or the Committee in the selection of a director as a person to whom Stock Awards may be granted, or in the determination of the number of shares which may be covered by Stock Awards granted to a director, the Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as from time to time in effect. The Board shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as from time to time in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this Article II, subsection 4(b) shall not apply if the Board or Committee expressly declares that such restrictions shall not apply.
 
(c) No person shall be eligible for the grant of an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan if, at the time of grant, such person owns (or is deemed to own pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Affiliates unless the exercise price of such Incentive Stock Option is at least one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant and the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
 
(d) Subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in Common Stock, no person shall be eligible to be granted Stock Awards covering more than 451,000 shares of Common Stock per person per calendar year.
 
 
An option granted pursuant to this Article II, Section 5 (a "Discretionary Stock Option") shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but
 
each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
 
(a) No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted.
 
(b) The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option and each Nonqualified Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted.
 
(c) The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either: (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised; or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, at the time of grant of the Option (A) by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock that have been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company's reported earnings and valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to Article II, subsection 5(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued.
 
In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at not less than the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.
 
(d) An Option granted to a natural person shall be exercisable during the lifetime of such person only by such person, provided that such person during such person's lifetime may designate a Trust to be such person's beneficiary with respect to any Incentive Stock Options and with respect to any Nonqualified Stock Options, and such beneficiary shall, after the death of the person to whom the Option was granted, have all the rights that such person has while living, including the right to exercise the Option. In the absence of such designation, after the death of the person to whom the Option is granted, the Option shall be exercisable by the person or persons to whom the optionee's rights under such Option pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
(e) The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). From time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable ("vest")
 
with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option was not fully exercised. During the remainder of the term of the Option (if its term extends beyond the end of the installment periods), the Option may be exercised from time to time with respect to any shares then remaining subject to the Option. The provisions of this Article II, subsection 5(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
(f) The Company may require any optionee, or any person to whom an Option is transferred under Article II, subsection 5(d), as a condition of exercising any such Option: (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, and that such person is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Option; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the Common Stock subject to the Option for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. These requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if: (x) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise of the Option has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"); or (y) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities law.
 
(g) An Option shall terminate three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate, unless the Option by its term specifies either (i) that it shall terminate sooner than three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate; or (ii) that it may be exercised more than three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate. This Article II, subsection 5(g) shall not be construed to extend the term of any Option or to permit anyone to exercise the Option after expiration of its term, nor shall it be construed to increase the number of shares as to which any Option is exercisable from the amount exercisable on the date of termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director.
 
(h) The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the optionee may elect at any time during the term of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or any Affiliate to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the stated vesting dates of the Option. Any shares
 
so purchased from any unvested installment or Option may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board or the Committee determines to be appropriate.
 
(i) To the extent provided by the terms of an Option, each optionee may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise of such Option by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of the Common Stock otherwise issuable to the optionee as a result of the exercise of the Option a number of shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the Common Stock having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
 
The Board may from time to time adopt award programs under the Plan providing for the grant of formula or non-discretionary Stock Awards to directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any Affiliate ("Non-Discretionary Director Awards"). The terms and conditions of any such program shall be established by the Board in its sole discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
 
 
Each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreements may change from time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as appropriate:
 
(a) The purchase price under each stock purchase agreement shall be such amount as the Board or Committee shall determine and designate in such agreement, but the purchase price shall not be less than fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date such award is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may determine that eligible participants in the Plan may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(b) No rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be assignable by any participant under the Plan, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except where such assignment is required by law or expressly authorized by the terms of the applicable stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement.
 
(c) The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement shall be paid either: (i) in cash at the time of purchase; (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Common Stock is sold; or (iii) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price of the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee to which administration of the Plan has been delegated may award Common Stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(d) Shares of Common Stock sold or awarded under the Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board or the Committee.
 
(e) In the event a person ceases to be an employee of or ceases to serve as a director or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate, the Company may repurchase or otherwise reacquire any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by that person which have not vested as of the date of termination under the terms of the stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement between the Company and such person.
 
(f) To the extent provided by the terms of a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement, a participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the lapsing of a repurchase option in favor of the Company or vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of the Common Stock otherwise deliverable to a participant as a result of the lapsing of a repurchase option in favor of the Company or the vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award a number of shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the Common Stock having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
 
(a) During the terms of the Stock Awards granted under the Plan, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards up to the number of shares of Common Stock authorized under the Plan.
 
(b) The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of Common Stock under the Stock Awards granted under the Plan; , , that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act either the Plan, any Stock Award granted under the Plan or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.
provided
however
 
 
Proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company.
 
 
(a) The Board or Committee shall have the power to accelerate the time during which a Stock Award may be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest, notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time during which it may be exercised or the time during which it will vest. Each Discretionary Stock Option providing for vesting pursuant to Article II, subsection 5(e) may also provide that if the employee's employment or a director's or consultant's affiliation with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is terminated by reason of death or disability, then the vesting schedule of Discretionary Stock Options granted to such employee, director or consultant or to the Trusts of such employee, director or consultant may be accelerated.
 
(b) Neither an optionee nor any person to whom an Option is transferred under the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Option unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Option pursuant to its terms.
 
(c) Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any eligible employee, consultant, director, optionee or holder of Stock Awards under the Plan any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate or to continue acting as a consultant or director or shall affect the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment or consulting relationship or directorship of any
 
eligible employee, consultant, director, optionee or holder of Stock Awards under the Plan with or without cause. In the event that a holder of Stock Awards under the Plan is permitted or otherwise entitled to take a leave of absence, the Company shall have the unilateral right to (i) determine whether such leave of absence will be treated as a termination of employment or relationship as consultant or director for purposes hereof, and (ii) suspend or otherwise delay the time or times at which exercisability or vesting would otherwise occur with respect to any outstanding Stock Awards under the Plan.
 
(d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Board or the Committee shall have the power to condition the grant or vesting of stock bonuses and rights to purchase restricted stock under the Plan upon the attainment of performance goals, determined by the Board or the Committee in their respective sole discretion, with respect to any one or more of the following business criteria with respect to the Company, any Affiliate, any division, any operating unit or any product line: (i) return on capital, assets or equity, (ii) sales or revenue, (iii) net income, (iv) cash flow, (v) earnings per share, (vi) adjusted earnings or adjusted net income as defined below, (vii) working capital, (vii) total shareholder return, (ix) economic value or (x) product development, research, in-licensing, out-licensing, litigation, human resources, information services, manufacturing, manufacturing capacity, production, inventory, site development, plant, building or facility development, government relations, product market share, mergers, acquisitions or sales of assets or subsidiaries. "Adjusted net income" and "adjusted earnings" shall mean net income or earnings, as the case may be, for the relevant performance period computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. which may be adjusted by the Committee, as specified in writing, for such performance period, at the time a performance goal is established for the performance period, for the following: (a) any item of significant gain or loss for the performance period determined to be related to a change in accounting principle as reflected in the Company's audited consolidated financial statements, (b) amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets, (c) expenses associated with acquired in-process research and development and (d) any other items of significant income or expense which are determined to be appropriate adjustments and are specified in writing by the Committee at the time the goal is established for the performance period. With respect to any stock bonuses or rights to purchase restricted stock granted to persons who are or who may be "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board or the Committee shall have the power to grant such awards upon terms and conditions that qualify such awards as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. Stock bonuses and rights to purchase restricted stock made in accordance with this Article II, subsection 10(d) shall contain the terms and conditions of Article II, Section 7 above.
 
 
If any change is made in the Common Stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award granted under the Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan and outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the Plan, the maximum number of shares which may be granted to a participant in a calendar year, the class(es) and number of shares and price per share of stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be granted as Non-Discretionary Director Awards, if any. Such adjustment shall be made by the Board or the Committee, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a "transaction not involving the receipt of consideration".) The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may accomplish any such adjustment in a manner calculated not to constitute a "modification" of any such Stock Awards (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) that would cause any such Stock Award to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).
 
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), then, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) the time during which Stock Awards become vested shall automatically be accelerated so that the unvested portions of all Stock Awards shall be vested prior to the Change in Control and (ii) the time during which the Options may be exercised shall automatically be accelerated to prior to the Change in Control. Upon and following the acceleration of the vesting and exercise periods, at the election of the holder of the Stock Award, the Stock Award may be: (x) exercised (with respect to Options) or, if the surviving or acquiring corporation agrees to assume the Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards, (y) assumed; or (z) replaced with substitute stock awards. Options not exercised, substituted or assumed prior to or upon the Change in Control shall be terminated. The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause any such assumption or substitution to be conducted in a manner so as not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any such Stock Award that would cause any such Stock Award to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).
 
(b) For purposes of Article II of the Plan, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred at any of the following times:
 
(i) upon the acquisition (other than from the Company) by any person, entity or "group," within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (excluding, for this purpose, the Company or its affiliates, or any employee benefit plan of the Company or its affiliates which acquires beneficial ownership of voting securities of the Company), of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of fifty percent (50%) or more of either the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or
 
(ii) at the time individuals who, as of the Restatement Date, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the Restatement Date, whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the Directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of Article II of the Plan, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; or
 
(iii) immediately prior to the consummation by the Company of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, (in each case, with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, own more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company's then outstanding voting securities) or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
 
(iv) the occurrence of any other event which the Incumbent Board in its sole discretion determines constitutes a Change of Control.
 
 
(a) Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, rights under Stock Awards may be assigned to an Alternate Payee to the extent that a QDRO so provides. (The terms "Alternate Payee" and "QDRO" are defined in Article II, subsection 13(c) below.) The assignment of a Stock Award to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO shall not be treated as having caused a new grant. The transfer of an Incentive Stock Option to an Alternate Payee may, however, cause it to fail to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. If a Stock Award is
 
assigned to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee generally has the same rights as the grantee under the terms of the Plan; , , that (i) the Stock Award shall be subject to the same vesting terms and exercise period as if the Stock Award were still held by the grantee, and (ii) an Alternate Payee may not transfer a Stock Award.
provided
however
 
(b) In the event of the Plan administrator's receipt of a domestic relations order or other notice of adverse claim by an Alternate Payee of a grantee of a Stock Award, transfer of the proceeds of the exercise of such Stock Award, whether in the form of cash, stock or other property, may be suspended. Such proceeds shall thereafter be transferred pursuant to the terms of a QDRO or other agreement between the grantee and Alternate Payee. A grantee's ability to exercise a Stock Award may be barred if the Plan administrator receives a court order directing the Plan administrator not to permit exercise.
 
(c) The word "QDRO" as used in Article II of the Plan shall mean a court order (i) that creates or recognizes the right of the spouse, former spouse or child (an "Alternate Payee") of an individual who is granted a Stock Award to an interest in such Stock Award relating to marital property rights or support obligations and (ii) that the administrator of the Plan determines would be a "qualified domestic relations order," as that term is defined in Section 414(p) of the Code and Section 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), but for the fact that the Plan is not a plan described in Section 3(3) of ERISA.
 
 
(a) The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan. However, except as provided in Article II, Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in the Common Stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or after the adoption of the amendment, where the amendment will:
 
(i) increase the number of shares reserved for Stock Awards under the Plan;
 
(ii) modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan (to the extent such modification requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code); or
 
(iii) modify the Plan in any other way if such modification requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code.
 
(b) The Board may in its sole discretion submit any other amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation to certain executive officers.
 
(c) It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide optionees with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to employee Incentive Stock Options and/or to bring the Plan and/or Options granted under it into compliance therewith.
 
(d) Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by any amendment of the Plan, unless: (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted; and (ii) such person consents in writing.
 
(e) Any amendment of the Plan may be accomplished in a manner calculated to cause such amendment not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any Stock Awards that would cause such Stock Awards to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Board or the Committee determines that any Stock Award may be subject to Code Section 409A, the Board or the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and without a Participant's prior consent to amend the Plan or any Stock Award as it may determine is necessary or desirable either for the Plan and Stock Awards to be exempt from the application of Section 409A or to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, including by adding conditions with respect to the vesting and/or the payment of the Stock Awards.
 
 
(a) The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. Unless sooner terminated, the Plan shall terminate on March 2, 2007. No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated.
 
(b) Rights and obligations under any Stock Awards granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.
 
 
Except as may be expressly provided with respect to any Stock Award granted under the Plan, the Plan and the Stock Awards are not intended to constitute a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, but rather are intended to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Plan and/or Stock Awards are nevertheless deemed to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Plan and Stock Awards shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury
 
regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the grant of any Stock Award. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Stock Award to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any Stock Award may be or become subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the affected Stock Award (as described above) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Plan and any Stock Award from the application of Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Stock Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

7.4 .
Exercise of Options
 
The Plan Administrator shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option the time at which, or the installments in which, the Option shall vest and become exercisable, which provisions may be waived or modified by the Plan Administrator at any time. If not so established in the instrument evidencing the Option, the Option shall vest and become exercisable according to the following schedule, which may be waived or modified by the Plan Administrator at any time:
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option granted under Article I of the Plan shall become 100% vested and exercisable on the date of termination of an Optionee's employment or service relationship with the Company or a Related Corporation on account of the Optionee's
 
death, provided that the Optionee has been in the continuous employment of or service to the Company or a Related Corporation for at least two years at the date of such Optionee's death.
 
The Plan Administrator may adjust the vesting schedule of an Option held by an Optionee who works less than "full-time" as that term is defined by the Plan Administrator.
 
To the extent that the right to purchase shares has accrued thereunder, an Option may be exercised from time to time by delivery to the Company of a stock option exercise agreement or notice, in a form and in accordance with procedures established by the Plan Administrator, setting forth the number of shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, the restrictions imposed on the shares purchased under such exercise agreement, if any, and such representations and agreements as may be required by the Company, accompanied by payment in full as described in Article I, Section 7.5. An Option may not be exercised as to less than a reasonable number of shares at any one time, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
 
7.5 .
Payment of Exercise Price
 
The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either: (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised; or (ii) at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, either at the time of grant or exercise of the Option (A) by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock that have been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company's reported earnings and valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to Article I, Section 10, or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Plan Administrator in its discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued.
 
In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at not less than the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.
 
7.6 .
Post-Termination Exercises
 
The Plan Administrator shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option whether the Option shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and conditions of such exercise, if an Optionee ceases to be employed by, or to provide services to, the Company or its Related Corporations, which provisions may be waived or modified by the Plan Administrator at any time. If not so established in the instrument evidencing the Option, the Option shall be exercisable according to the following terms and conditions, which may be waived or modified by the Plan Administrator at any time:
 
(a) Any portion of an Option that is not vested and exercisable on the date of termination of the Optionee's employment or service relationship (the "Termination Date") shall expire on such date, unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise.
 
(b) Any portion of an Option that is vested and exercisable on the Termination Date shall expire upon the earliest to occur of:
 
(i) the last day of the Option Term;
 
(ii) if the Optionee's Termination Date occurs for reasons other than Cause, Disability, death or Retirement, the three-month anniversary of such Termination Date; and
 
(iii) if the Optionee's Termination Date occurs by reason of Disability, death or Retirement, the one-year anniversary of such Termination Date.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Optionee dies after the Termination Date while the Option is otherwise exercisable, the Option shall expire upon the earlier to occur of (y) the last day of the Option Term and (z) the first anniversary of the date of death.
 
Also notwithstanding the foregoing, in case of termination of the Optionee's employment or service relationship for Cause, the Option shall automatically expire upon first notification to the Optionee of such termination, unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise. If an Optionee's employment or service relationship with the Company is suspended pending an investigation of whether the Optionee shall be terminated for Cause, all the Optionee's rights under any Option likewise shall be suspended during the period of investigation.
 
An Optionee's transfer of employment or service relationship between or among the Company and its Related Corporations, or a change in status from an employee to a consultant that is evidenced by a written agreement between an Optionee and the Company or a Related
 
Corporation, shall not be considered a termination of employment or service relationship for purposes of this Article I, Section 7. Employment or service relationship shall be deemed to continue while the Optionee is on a bona fide leave of absence, if such leave was approved by the Company or a Related Corporation in writing and if continued crediting of service for purposes of this Article I, Section 7 is expressly required by the terms of such leave or by applicable law (as determined by the Company). The effect of a Company-approved leave of absence on the terms and conditions of an Option shall be determined by the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion.
 
 
To the extent required by Section 422 of the Code, Incentive Stock Options shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions:
 
8.1 .
Dollar Limitation
 
To the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Grant Date) of Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other stock option plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such portion in excess of $100,000 shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option. In the event the Optionee holds two or more such Options that become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, such limitation shall be applied on the basis of the order in which such Options are granted.
 
8.2 .
More Than 10% Stockholders
 
If an individual owns more than 10% of the total voting power of all classes of the Company's stock, then the exercise price per share of an Incentive Stock Option shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date and the Option Term shall not exceed five years. The determination of more than 10% ownership shall be made in accordance with Section 422 of the Code.
 
8.3 .
Eligible Employees
 
Individuals who are not employees of the Company or one of its parent corporations or subsidiary corporations may not be granted Incentive Stock Options. For purposes of this Article I, Section 8.3, "parent corporation" and "subsidiary corporation" shall have the meanings attributed to those terms for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.
 
8.4 .
Term
 
Except as provided in Article I, Section 8.2, the Option Term shall not exceed 10 years.
 
8.5 .
Exercisability

For purposes of this Article I, Section 8.5, Disability shall mean "disability" as that term is defined for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.
 
8.6 .
Taxation of Incentive Stock Options
 
In order to obtain certain tax benefits afforded to Incentive Stock Options under Section 422 of the Code, the Optionee must hold the shares issued upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option for two years after the Grant Date and one year from the date of exercise. An Optionee may be subject to the alternative minimum tax at the time of exercise of an Incentive Stock Option. The Optionee shall give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares acquired by the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option prior to the expiration of such holding periods.
 
 
The Company may require the Optionee to pay to the Company the amount of any withholding taxes that the Company is required to withhold with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of any Option. Subject to the Plan and applicable law, the Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit the Optionee to satisfy withholding obligations, in whole or in part, by paying cash, by electing to have the Company withhold shares of Common Stock or by transferring shares of Common Stock to the Company, in such amounts as are equivalent to the Fair Market Value of the withholding obligation. The Company shall have the right to withhold from any Option or any shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to an Option or from any
 
cash amounts otherwise due or to become due from the Company to the Optionee an amount equal to such taxes. The Company may also deduct from any Option any other amounts due from the Optionee to the Company or a Related Corporation.
 
 
Options granted under Article I of the Plan and any interest therein may not be assigned, pledged or transferred by the Optionee and may not be made subject to attachment or similar proceedings otherwise than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, and, during the Optionee's lifetime, such Options may be exercised only by the Optionee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by Section 422 of the Code, the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may permit such assignment, transfer and exercisability and may permit an Optionee to designate a beneficiary who may exercise the Option or receive compensation under the Option after the Optionee's death; , , that any Option so assigned or transferred shall be subject to all the same terms and conditions contained in the instrument evidencing the Option.
provided
however
 
 
11.1 .
Adjustment of Shares
 
The aggregate number and class of shares for which Options may be granted under the Plan, the number and class of shares covered by each outstanding Option and the exercise price per share thereof (but not the total price), shall all be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a split-up or consolidation of shares or any like capital adjustment, or the payment of any stock dividend (not including the stock dividend approved by the Board of Directors of Immunex on February 23, 1999).
 
11.2 .
Cash, Stock or Other Property for Stock
 
Except as provided in Article I, Section 11.3, upon a merger (other than a merger of the Company in which the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of Common Stock in the surviving corporation immediately after the merger), consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization (other than a mere reincorporation or the creation of a holding company) or liquidation of the Company, as a result of which the stockholders of the Company receive cash, stock or other property in exchange for or in connection with their shares of Common Stock, any Option granted hereunder
 
shall terminate, but the Optionee shall have the right immediately prior to any such merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation or reorganization to exercise such Option in whole or in part whether or not the vesting requirements set forth in the Option agreement have been satisfied.
 
11.3 .
Conversion of Options on Stock for Stock Exchange
 
If the stockholders of the Company receive capital stock of another corporation ("Exchange Stock") in exchange for their shares of Common Stock in any transaction involving a merger (other than a merger of the Company in which the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of Common Stock in the surviving corporation immediately after the merger), consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation or reorganization (other than a mere reincorporation or the creation of a holding company), the Company and the corporation issuing the Exchange Stock, in their sole discretion, may determine that all Options granted hereunder shall be converted into options to purchase shares of Exchange Stock instead of terminating in accordance with the provisions of Article I, Section 11.2. The amount and price of converted options shall be determined by adjusting the amount and price of the Options granted hereunder in the same proportion as used for determining the number of shares of Exchange Stock the holders of the Common Stock receive in such merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation or reorganization. Unless accelerated by the Board, the vesting schedule set forth in the Option agreement shall continue to apply to the options granted for the Exchange Stock. The aggregate number and kind of shares for which options may be granted under this Plan shall be proportionately adjusted in the event of such merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, liquidation or reorganization.
 
11.4 .
Fractional Shares
 
In the event of any adjustment in the number of shares covered by any Option, any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be disregarded and each such Option shall cover only the number of full shares resulting from such adjustment.
 
11.5 .
Determination of Board to Be Final
 
All Article I, Section 11 adjustments shall be made by the Plan Administrator, and its determination as to what adjustments shall be made, and the extent thereof, shall be final, binding and conclusive. Unless an Optionee agrees otherwise, any change or adjustment to an Incentive Stock Option shall be made in such a manner so as not to constitute a "modification"
 
as defined in Section 424(h) of the Code and so as not to cause his or her Incentive Stock Option issued hereunder to fail to continue to qualify as an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422(b) of the Code.
 
11.6 .
Limitations
 
The grant of Options shall in no way affect the Company's right to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
 
 
12.1 .
Amendment of Plan
 
The Plan may be amended only by the Board in such respects as it shall deem advisable; , , that to the extent required for compliance with Section 422 of the Code or any applicable law or regulation, stockholder approval shall be required for any amendment that would (a) increase the total number of shares available for issuance under the Plan, (b) modify the class of persons eligible to receive Options, or (c) otherwise require stockholder approval under any applicable law or regulation. Any amendment made to the Plan that would constitute a "modification" to Incentive Stock Options outstanding on the date of such amendment shall not, without the consent of the Optionee, be applicable to such outstanding Incentive Stock Options but shall have prospective effect only.
provided
however
 
12.2 .
Termination of Plan
 
The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. The Plan shall have no fixed expiration date; , , that no Incentive Stock Options may be granted more than 10 years after the later of (a) the Plan's adoption by the Board of Directors of Immunex and (b) the adoption by the Board of Directors of Immunex of any amendment to the Plan that constitutes the adoption of a new plan for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.
provided
however
 
12.3 .
Consent of Optionee
 
The amendment or termination of the Plan or the amendment of an outstanding Option shall not, without the Optionee's consent, impair or diminish any rights or obligations under any Option theretofore granted to the Optionee under the Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no outstanding Option shall be terminated without the consent of the Optionee. Any
 
change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall not, without the consent of the Optionee, be made in a manner so as to constitute a "modification" that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option.
 
 
13.1 .
Evidence of Options
 
Options granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written instrument that shall contain such terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions as the Plan Administrator shall deem advisable and that are not inconsistent with the Plan.
 
13.2 .
No Individual Rights
 
Nothing in the Plan or any Option granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any Optionee any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Corporation or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Related Corporation of the Company to terminate an Optionee's employment or other relationship at any time, with or without Cause.
 
13.3 .
Registration
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless such issuance, delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act), and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
 
The Company shall be under no obligation to any Optionee to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify under state securities laws, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue in effect any such registrations or qualifications if made. The Company may issue certificates for shares with such legends and subject to such restrictions on transfer and stop-transfer instructions as counsel for the Company deems necessary or desirable for compliance by the Company with federal and state securities laws.
 
To the extent that the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Option provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.
 
13.4 .
No Rights as a Stockholder
 
No Option shall entitle the Optionee to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a stockholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan of the shares that are the subject of such Option.
 
13.5 .
Compliance With Laws and Regulations
 
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to Optionees who are officers or directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other Optionees. Additionally, in interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan shall, to the extent permitted by law, be construed as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
 
13.6 .
Optionees in Foreign Countries
 
The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Related Corporations may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Options granted to Optionees employed in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
 
13.7 .
No Trust or Fund
 
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan. Nothing contained herein shall require the Company to segregate any monies or other property, or shares of Common Stock, or to create any trusts, or to make any special deposits for any immediate or deferred amounts payable to any Optionee, and no Optionee shall have any rights that are greater than those of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
 
13.8 .
Severability
 
If any provision of the Plan or any Option is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person, or would disqualify the Plan or any Option under any law deemed applicable by the Plan Administrator, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or, if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the Plan Administrator's determination, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Option, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Option, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Option shall remain in full force and effect.
 
13.9 .
Choice of Law
 
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.
 
 
The Effective Date of the Original Plan was the date on which it was adopted by the Board of Directors of Immunex, provided that it was approved by Immunex's stockholders at any time within 12 months of such adoption.
 
 
Notwithstanding anything in Article I of the Plan or any program adopted under the Original Plan to the contrary, effective as of the Effective Time (as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between the Company, AMS Acquisition Inc. and Immunex dated as of December 16, 2001, as amended by that certain First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 15, 2002 (as amended, the "Merger Agreement")), the following provisions shall constitute an addendum (the "Addendum") to Article I of the Plan:
 
15.1. At the Effective Time, each option granted pursuant Article I of the Plan shall be treated in accordance with the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement.
 
15.2. In the event that an optionee's employment with Immunex or the Company is terminated by the optionee for Good Reason or by Immunex or the Company without Cause during the fifteen (15) months following the Effective Time, each option held by such optionee
 
for Common Stock that was granted pursuant to the Merger Agreement with respect to (a) a Cancelled Company Option (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or (b) an option for common stock of Immunex that was granted after December 16, 2001, shall immediately vest in full and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of the optionee's termination of employment or (y) the end of the term of such option.
 
15.3. In the event that an optionee who is a nonemployee director of Immunex immediately prior to the Effective Time ceases to be a director of Immunex or the Company for any reason immediately prior to, at, or during the fifteen (15) months following the Effective Time, each option held by such optionee for Common Stock shall immediately vest in full and shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of the date such optionee ceases to be a director of Immunex or the Company or (y) the end of the term of such option.
 
15.4.

15.5. For purposes of this Addendum only, "Cause" shall mean (a) the willful and continued failure by the optionee to substantially perform the optionee's duties with Immunex or the Company (other than such failure resulting form the optionee's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) or (b) the willful engaging by the optionee in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to Immunex or the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this definition, no act, or failure to act, on the optionee's part shall be deemed willful unless done, or omitted to be done, by the optionee not in good faith or without reasonable belief that the optionee's act, or failure to act, was in the best interest of Immunex or the Company.
 
 
 
The following provisions of this Article II shall govern awards granted under the Plan on or after the Restatement Date:
 
 
(a) The purpose of Article II of the Plan is to provide a means by which employees or directors of and consultants to Amgen Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and its Affiliates, as defined in Article II, paragraph 1(b), directly, or indirectly through Trusts, may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of the stock of the Company through the granting of (i) incentive stock options, (ii) nonqualified stock options, (iii) stock bonuses, and (iv) rights to purchase restricted stock, all as defined below.
 
(b) The word "Affiliate" as used in Article II of the Plan means (a) any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the regulations and other official guidance promulgated thereunder, the "Code") and (b) any domestic eligible entity that is disregarded, under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3, as an entity separate from either (i) the Company or (ii) any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation, as those terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and (f), respectively, of the Code.
 
(c) The Company, by means of Article II of the Plan, seeks to retain the services of persons now employed by or serving as directors or consultants to the Company, to secure and retain the services of persons capable of filling such positions, and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company.
 
(d) The Company intends that the rights issued under Article II of the Plan shall, in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") or any committee to which responsibility for administration of the Plan has been delegated pursuant to Article II, paragraph 2(c), be either (i) stock options granted pursuant to Article II, Sections 5 or 6 hereof, including incentive stock options as that term is used in Section 422 of the Code ("Incentive Stock Options"), or options which do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options ("Nonqualified Stock Options") (together hereinafter referred to as "Options"), or (ii) stock bonuses or rights to purchase restricted stock granted pursuant to Article II, Section 7 hereof (all such rights included in (i) and (ii), collectively "Stock Awards").
 
(e) The word "Trust" as used in Article II of the Plan shall mean a trust created for the benefit of the employee, director or consultant, his or her spouse, or members of their immediate family. The word optionee shall mean the person to whom the option is granted or the employee, director or consultant for whose benefit the option is granted to a Trust, as the context shall require.
 
 
(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board unless and until the Board delegates administration to a committee, as provided in Article II, paragraph 2(c).
 
(b) The Board shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
 
(1) To determine from time to time which of the persons eligible under the Plan shall be granted Stock Awards; when and how Stock Awards shall be granted; whether a Stock Award will be an Incentive Stock Option, a Nonqualified Stock Option, a stock bonus, a right to purchase restricted stock, or a combination of the foregoing; the provisions of each Stock Award granted (which need not be identical), including the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase or receive stock pursuant to a Stock Award; and the number of shares with respect to which Stock Awards shall be granted to each such person.
 
(2) To construe and interpret the Plan and Stock Awards granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Board, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or inconsistency in the Plan or in any Stock Award, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.
 
(3) To amend the Plan as provided in Article II, Section 14.
 
(4) Generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as the Board deems necessary or expedient to promote the best interests of the Company.
 
(c) The Board may delegate administration of the Plan to a committee composed of not fewer than two (2) members of the Board (the "Committee"). One or more of these members may be non-employee directors and outside directors, if required and as defined by the
 
provisions of Article II, paragraphs 2(e) and 2(f). If administration is delegated to a Committee, the Committee shall have, in connection with the administration of the Plan, the powers theretofore possessed by the Board (except amendment of any program adopted pursuant to Article II, Section 6 or any Non-Discretionary Director Awards granted thereunder shall only be by action taken by the Board or a committee of one or more members of the Board to which such authority has been specifically delegated by the Board), subject, however, to such resolutions, not inconsistent with the provisions of Article II of the Plan, as may be adopted from time to time by the Board. Notwithstanding anything else in this Article II, paragraph 2(c) to the contrary, at any time the Board or the Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board the authority to grant or amend Stock Awards to all employees, directors or consultants or any portion or class thereof.
 
(d) Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan to the contrary, at any time the Board or the Committee may authorize by duly adopted resolution one or more Officers (as defined below) (each a "Delegated Officer") to take the actions described in Article II, paragraph 2(b)(1) of the Plan with respect to Options only, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of Article II of the Plan; , , that a Delegated Officer shall not have the power to (1) grant any Options to himself, any non-employee director, consultant, Trust, other Delegated Officer or Officer, (2) determine the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option (i.e., vesting), (3) determine the exercise price of an Option, or (4) grant any Option to a parent corporation of the Company, as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code. The resolution authorizing a Delegated Officer to act as such shall specify the total number of shares of Common Stock that a Delegated Officer may grant with respect to Options. The exercise price, which shall be not less than 100% of the closing price of the Common Stock of the Company as quoted on the NASDAQ system on the grant date, or in the Board or the Committee's sole discretion, otherwise determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Code Section 409A (the "Option Fair Market Value") and the time or times when a person shall be permitted to purchase stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall, however, be set by the Board or the Committee and not by a Delegated Officer to the extent required by Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157 or any other applicable law. The term "Officer" shall include any natural person who is elected as a corporate officer of the Company by the Board.
provided
however
 
(e) The term "non-employee director" shall mean a member of the Board who (i) is not currently an officer of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) or an employee of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company; (ii) does not receive compensation from the
 
Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company for services rendered in any capacity other than as a member of the Board (including a consultant) in an amount required to be disclosed to the Company's stockholders under Rule 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Rule 404"); (iii) does not possess an interest in any other transaction required to be disclosed under Rule 404; or (iv) is not engaged in a business relationship required to be disclosed under Rule 404, as all of these provisions are interpreted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
 
(f) The term "outside director," as used in Article II of this Plan, shall mean an administrator of the Plan, whether a member of the Board or of any Committee to which responsibility for administration of the Plan has been delegated pursuant to Article II, paragraph 2(c), who is considered to be an "outside director" in accordance with the rules, regulations or interpretations of Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
(g) Any requirement that an administrator of the Plan be a "non-employee director" or "outside director" shall not apply if the Board or the Committee expressly declares that such requirement shall not apply.
 
 
(a) Subject to the provisions of Article II, Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in stock, the stock that may be issued pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate 19,273,852 shares of the Company's $.0001 par value common stock (the "Common Stock"). If any Stock Award granted under the Plan shall for any reason expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, the Common Stock not purchased under such Stock Award shall again become available for the Plan. Shares repurchased by the Company pursuant to any repurchase rights reserved by the Company pursuant to the Plan shall not be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
 
(b) The Common Stock subject to the Plan may be unissued shares or reacquired shares, bought on the market or otherwise.
 
(c) An Incentive Stock Option may be granted to an eligible person under the Plan only if the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which incentive stock options (as defined by the Code) are exercisable for the first time by such optionee during any calendar year under all such plans of the Company and its Affiliates does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars
 
($100,000). If it is determined that an entire Option or any portion thereof does not qualify for treatment as an Incentive Stock Option by reason of exceeding such maximum, such Option or the applicable portion shall be considered a Nonqualified Stock Option.
 
 
(a) Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees (including officers) of the Company or its Affiliates. A director of the Company shall not be eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options unless such director is also an employee of the Company or any Affiliate. Stock Awards other than Incentive Stock Options may be granted to employees (including officers) or directors of or consultants to the Company or any Affiliate or to Trusts of any such employee, director or consultant.
 
(b) A director shall in no event be eligible for the benefits of the Plan (other than Non-Discretionary Director Awards, as defined in Article II, Section 6) unless and until such director is expressly declared eligible to participate in the Plan by action of the Board or the Committee, and only if, at any time discretion is exercised by the Board or the Committee in the selection of a director as a person to whom Stock Awards may be granted, or in the determination of the number of shares which may be covered by Stock Awards granted to a director, the Plan complies with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as from time to time in effect. The Board shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, as from time to time in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this Article II, paragraph 4(b) shall not apply if the Board or Committee expressly declares that such restrictions shall not apply.
 
(c) No person shall be eligible for the grant of an Incentive Stock Option under the Plan if, at the time of grant, such person owns (or is deemed to own pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Affiliates unless the exercise price of such Incentive Stock Option is at least one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant and the Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years from the date of grant.
 
(d) Stock Awards shall be limited to a maximum of 649,455 shares of Common Stock per person per calendar year.
 
 
An option granted pursuant to this Article II, Section 5 (a "Discretionary Stock Option") shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of separate Options need not be identical, but each Option shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the Option or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions:
 
(a) No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it was granted.
 
(b) The exercise price of each Incentive Stock Option and each Nonqualified Stock Option shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock subject to the Option on the date the Option is granted.
 
(c) The purchase price of Common Stock acquired pursuant to an Option shall be paid, to the extent permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either: (i) in cash at the time the Option is exercised; or (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, either at the time of grant or exercise of the Option (A) by delivery to the Company of shares of Common Stock that have been held for the period required to avoid a charge to the Company's reported earnings and valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise, (B) according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Option is granted or to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to Article II, paragraph 5(d), or (C) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price to the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued.
 
In the case of any deferred payment arrangement, interest shall be payable at least annually and shall be charged at not less than the minimum rate of interest necessary to avoid the treatment as interest, under any applicable provisions of the Code, of any amounts other than amounts stated to be interest under the deferred payment arrangement.
 
(d) An Option granted to a natural person shall be exercisable during the lifetime of such person only by such person, provided that such person during such person's lifetime may designate a Trust to be such person's beneficiary with respect to any Incentive Stock Options and with respect to any Nonqualified Stock Options, and such beneficiary shall, after the death of the person to whom the Option was granted, have all the rights that such person has while living,
 
including the right to exercise the Option. In the absence of such designation, after the death of the person to whom the Option is granted, the Option shall be exercisable by the person or persons to whom the optionee's rights under such Option pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
(e) The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option may, but need not, be allotted in periodic installments (which may, but need not, be equal). From time to time during each of such installment periods, the Option may become exercisable ("vest") with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to that period, and may be exercised with respect to some or all of the shares allotted to such period and/or any prior period as to which the Option was not fully exercised. During the remainder of the term of the Option (if its term extends beyond the end of the installment periods), the Option may be exercised from time to time with respect to any shares then remaining subject to the Option. The provisions of this Article II, paragraph 5(e) are subject to any Option provisions governing the minimum number of shares as to which an Option may be exercised.
 
(f) The Company may require any optionee, or any person to whom an Option is transferred under Article II, paragraph 5(d), as a condition of exercising any such Option: (i) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company as to such person's knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and/or to employ a purchaser representative who has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, and that such person is capable of evaluating, alone or together with the purchaser representative, the merits and risks of exercising the Option; and (ii) to give written assurances satisfactory to the Company stating that such person is acquiring the Common Stock subject to the Option for such person's own account and not with any present intention of selling or otherwise distributing the Common Stock. These requirements, and any assurances given pursuant to such requirements, shall be inoperative if: (x) the issuance of the shares upon the exercise of the Option has been registered under a then currently effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"); or (y) as to any particular requirement, a determination is made by counsel for the Company that such requirement need not be met in the circumstances under the then applicable securities law.
 
(g) An Option shall terminate three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate, unless the Option by its term specifies either (i) that it shall terminate sooner than three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or an Affiliate; or (ii) that it may be exercised more than three (3) months after termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the
 
Company or an Affiliate. This Article II, paragraph 5(g) shall not be construed to extend the term of any Option or to permit anyone to exercise the Option after expiration of its term, nor shall it be construed to increase the number of shares as to which any Option is exercisable from the amount exercisable on the date of termination of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director.
 
(h) The Option may, but need not, include a provision whereby the optionee may elect at any time during the term of the optionee's employment or relationship as a consultant or director with the Company or any Affiliate to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the shares subject to the Option prior to the stated vesting dates of the Option. Any shares so purchased from any unvested installment or Option may be subject to a repurchase right in favor of the Company or to any other restriction the Board or the Committee determines to be appropriate.
 
(i) To the extent provided by the terms of an Option, each optionee may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise of such Option by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of the Common Stock otherwise issuable to the optionee as a result of the exercise of the Option a number of shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the Common Stock having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
 
The Board may from time to time adopt award programs under the Plan providing for the grant of formula or non-discretionary Stock Awards to directors of the Company who are not employees of the Company or any Affiliate ("Non-Discretionary Director Awards"). The terms and conditions of any such program shall be established by the Board in its sole discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
 
 
Each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be in such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board or the Committee shall deem appropriate. The terms and conditions of stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreements may change from
 
time to time, and the terms and conditions of separate agreements need not be identical, but each stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall include (through incorporation of provisions hereof by reference in the agreement or otherwise) the substance of each of the following provisions as appropriate:
 
(a) The purchase price under each stock purchase agreement shall be such amount as the Board or Committee shall determine and designate in such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee may determine that eligible participants in the Plan may be awarded stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(b) No rights under a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement shall be assignable by any participant under the Plan, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except where such assignment is required by law or expressly authorized by the terms of the applicable stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement.
 
(c) The purchase price of stock acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement shall be paid either: (i) in cash at the time of purchase; (ii) at the discretion of the Board or the Committee, according to a deferred payment or other arrangement with the person to whom the Common Stock is sold; or (iii) in any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Board or the Committee in their discretion; including but not limited to payment of the purchase price pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board which results in the receipt of cash (or a check) by the Company before Common Stock is issued or the receipt of irrevocable instruction to pay the aggregate exercise price of the Company from the sales proceeds before Common Stock is issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board or the Committee to which administration of the Plan has been delegated may award Common Stock pursuant to a stock bonus agreement in consideration for past services actually rendered to the Company or for its benefit.
 
(d) Shares of Common Stock sold or awarded under the Plan may, but need not, be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Board or the Committee.
 
(e) In the event a person ceases to be an employee of or ceases to serve as a director or consultant to the Company or an Affiliate, the Company may repurchase or otherwise reacquire any or all of the shares of Common Stock held by that person which have not vested as of the date of termination under the terms of the stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement between the Company and such person.
 
(f) To the extent provided by the terms of a stock bonus or restricted stock purchase agreement, a participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the lapsing of a repurchase option in favor of the Company or vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award by any of the following means or by a combination of such means: (i) tendering a cash payment; (ii) authorizing the Company to withhold from the shares of the Common Stock otherwise deliverable to a participant as a result of the lapsing of a repurchase option in favor of the Company or the vesting of a stock bonus or a restricted stock award a number of shares having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding; or (iii) delivering to the Company owned and unencumbered shares of the Common Stock having a fair market value less than or equal to the amount of the Company's required minimum statutory withholding.
 
 
(a) During the terms of the Stock Awards granted under the Plan, the Company shall keep available at all times the number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy such Stock Awards up to the number of shares of Common Stock authorized under the Plan.
 
(b) The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to issue and sell shares of Common Stock under the Stock Awards granted under the Plan; , , that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act either the Plan, any Stock Award granted under the Plan or any Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Stock Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise of such Stock Awards unless and until such authority is obtained.
provided
however
 
 
Proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of the Company.
 
 
(a) The Board or Committee shall have the power to accelerate the time during which a Stock Award may be exercised or the time during which a Stock Award or any part thereof will vest, notwithstanding the provisions in the Stock Award stating the time during which it may be exercised or the time during which it will vest. Each Discretionary Stock Option providing for vesting pursuant to Article II, paragraph 5(e) may also provide that if the employee's employment or a director's or consultant's affiliation with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is terminated by reason of death or disability, then the vesting schedule of Discretionary Stock Options granted to such employee, director or consultant or to the Trusts of such employee, director or consultant may be accelerated.
 
(b) Neither an optionee nor any person to whom an Option is transferred under the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares subject to such Option unless and until such person has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Option pursuant to its terms.
 
(c) Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Stock Award granted pursuant thereto shall confer upon any eligible employee, consultant, director, optionee or holder of Stock Awards under the Plan any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate or to continue acting as a consultant or director or shall affect the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment or consulting relationship or directorship of any eligible employee, consultant, director, optionee or holder of Stock Awards under the Plan with or without cause. In the event that a holder of Stock Awards under the Plan is permitted or otherwise entitled to take a leave of absence, the Company shall have the unilateral right to (i) determine whether such leave of absence will be treated as a termination of employment or relationship as consultant or director for purposes hereof, and (ii) suspend or otherwise delay the time or times at which exercisability or vesting would otherwise occur with respect to any outstanding Stock Awards under the Plan.
 
 
If any change is made in the Common Stock subject to the Plan, or subject to any Stock Award granted under the Plan (through merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by the Company), the Plan and outstanding Stock Awards will be appropriately adjusted in the class(es) and maximum number of shares subject to the Plan, the maximum number of shares which may be granted to a participant in a calendar year, the class(es) and number of shares and price per share of stock subject to outstanding Stock Awards, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be granted as Non-Discretionary
 
Director Awards, if any. Such adjustment shall be made by the Board or the Committee, the determination of which shall be final, binding and conclusive. (The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as a "transaction not involving the receipt of consideration".) The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may accomplish any such adjustment in a manner calculated not to constitute a "modification" of any such Stock Awards (within the meaning of Code Section 409A) that would cause any such Stock Award to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).
 
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), then, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) the time during which Stock Awards become vested shall automatically be accelerated so that the unvested portions of all Stock Awards shall be vested prior to the Change in Control and (ii) the time during which the Options may be exercised shall automatically be accelerated to prior to the Change in Control. Upon and following the acceleration of the vesting and exercise periods, at the election of the holder of the Stock Award, the Stock Award may be: (x) exercised (with respect to Options) or, if the surviving or acquiring corporation agrees to assume the Stock Awards or substitute similar stock awards, (y) assumed; or (z) replaced with substitute stock awards. Options not exercised, substituted or assumed prior to or upon the Change in Control shall be terminated. The Board or the Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause any such assumption or substitution to be conducted in a manner so as not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any such Stock Award that would cause any such Stock Award to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).
 
(b) For purposes of Article II of the Plan, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred at any of the following times:
 
(i) upon the acquisition (other than from the Company) by any person, entity or "group," within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act (excluding, for this purpose, the Company or its affiliates, or any employee benefit plan of the Company or its affiliates which acquires beneficial ownership of voting securities of the Company), of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of fifty percent (50%) or more of either the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or
 
(ii) at the time individuals who, as of July 15, 2002, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to July 15, 2002, whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of the Directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall be, for purposes of Article II of the Plan, considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board; or
 
(iii) immediately prior to the consummation by the Company of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, (in each case, with respect to which persons who were the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization, merger or consolidation do not, immediately thereafter, own more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company's then outstanding voting securities) or a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or of the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
 
(iv) the occurrence of any other event which the Incumbent Board in its sole discretion determines constitutes a Change of Control.
 
 
(a) Anything in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, rights under Stock Awards may be assigned to an Alternate Payee to the extent that a QDRO so provides. (The terms "Alternate Payee" and "QDRO" are defined in Article II, paragraph 13(c) below.) The assignment of a Stock Award to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO shall not be treated as having caused a new grant. The transfer of an Incentive Stock Option to an Alternate Payee may, however, cause it to fail to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option. If a Stock Award is assigned to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee generally has the same rights as the grantee under the terms of the Plan; provided however, that (i) the Stock Award shall be subject to the same vesting terms and exercise period as if the Stock Award were still held by the grantee and (ii) an Alternate Payee may not transfer a Stock Award.
 
(b) In the event of the Plan administrator's receipt of a domestic relations order or other notice of adverse claim by an Alternate Payee of a grantee of a Stock Award, transfer of the
 
proceeds of the exercise of such Stock Award, whether in the form of cash, stock or other property, may be suspended. Such proceeds shall thereafter be transferred pursuant to the terms of a QDRO or other agreement between the grantee and Alternate Payee. A grantee's ability to exercise a Stock Award may be barred if the Plan administrator receives a court order directing the Plan administrator not to permit exercise.
 
(c) The word "QDRO" as used in Article II of the Plan shall mean a court order (i) that creates or recognizes the right of the spouse, former spouse or child (an "Alternate Payee") of an individual who is granted a Stock Award to an interest in such Stock Award relating to marital property rights or support obligations and (ii) that the administrator of the Plan determines would be a "qualified domestic relations order," as that term is defined in section 414(p) of the Code and section 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"), but for the fact that the Plan is not a plan described in section 3(3) of ERISA.
 
 
(a) The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan. However, except as provided in Article II, Section 11 relating to adjustments upon changes in the Common Stock, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or after the adoption of the amendment, where the amendment will:
 
(i) increase the number of shares reserved for Stock Awards under the Plan;
 
(ii) modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan (to the extent such modification requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code); or
 
(iii) modify the Plan in any other way if such modification requires stockholder approval in order for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 422(b) of the Code.
 
(b) The Board may in its sole discretion submit any other amendment to the Plan for stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation to certain executive officers.
 
(c) It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable to provide optionees with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to employee Incentive Stock Options and/or to bring the Plan and/or Options granted under it into compliance therewith.
 
(d) Rights and obligations under any Stock Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by any amendment of the Plan, unless: (i) the Company requests the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted; and (ii) such person consents in writing.
 
(e) Any amendment of the Plan may be accomplished in a manner calculated to cause such amendment not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any Stock Awards that would cause such Stock Awards to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Board or the Committee determines that any Stock Award may be subject to Code Section 409A, the Board or the Committee may, in its sole discretion, and without a Participant's prior consent to amend the Plan or any Stock Award as it may determine is necessary or desirable either for the Plan and Stock Awards to be exempt from the application of Section 409A or to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, including by adding conditions with respect to the vesting and/or the payment of the Stock Awards.
 
 
(a) The Board may suspend or terminate the Plan at any time. No Stock Awards may be granted under the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. No Incentive Stock Options may be granted under the Plan after February 22, 2009.
 
(b) Rights and obligations under any Stock Awards granted while the Plan is in effect shall not be impaired by suspension or termination of the Plan, except with the consent of the person to whom the Stock Award was granted.
 
 
Except as may be expressly provided with respect to any Stock Award granted under the Plan, the Plan and the Stock Awards are not intended to constitute a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, but rather are intended to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A. To the extent that the Plan and/or Stock Awards are nevertheless deemed to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Plan and Stock Awards
 
shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the grant of any Stock Award. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or any Stock Award to the contrary, in the event that the Committee determines that any Stock Award may be or become subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the affected Stock Award (as described above) or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Plan and any Stock Award from the application of Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Stock Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, at any time the Committee determines that the Performance Units may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and without a Participant's prior consent to amend the Program as it may determine is necessary or desirable either for the Performance Units to be exempt from the application of Section 409A or to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, including by adding conditions with respect to the vesting and/or the payment of the Performance Units, provided that no such amendment may change the Program's "performance goals," within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to any person who is a "covered employee," within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Amendment and Termination
provided, however
 
9.3 . Nothing contained in this Program or in any document related to this Program or to any Award shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue as an employee or in the employ of the Company or an Affiliate or constitute any contract or agreement of employment for a specific term or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or an Affiliate to reduce such person's compensation, to change the position held by such person or to terminate the employment of such person, with or without cause.
No Contract for Employment
 
9.4 . No benefit payable under, or interest in, this Program shall be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge and any such attempted action shall be void and no such benefit or interest shall be, in any manner, liable for, or subject to, debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of any Participant or beneficiary; , that, nothing in this Section 9.4 shall prevent transfer (i) by will, (ii) by applicable laws of descent and distribution or (iii) to an Alternate Payee to the extent that a QDRO so provides. The assignment of an Award to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a QDRO shall not be treated as having caused a new grant. If an Award is assigned to an Alternate Payee, the Alternate Payee generally has the same rights as the Participant under the terms of the
Nontransferability
provided, however
 
Program; , that (i) the Award shall be subject to the same vesting terms as if the Award were still held by the Participant, and (ii) an Alternate Payee may not transfer an Award. In the event of the 1991 Plan administrator's receipt of a domestic relations order or other notice of adverse claim by an Alternate Payee of a Participant, transfer of the proceeds of such Award may be suspended. Such proceeds shall thereafter be transferred pursuant to the terms of a QDRO or other agreement between the Participant and Alternate Payee. A Participant's ability to receive payment of an Award may be barred if the 1991 Plan administrator receives a court order directing the 1991 Plan administrator not to make such payment.
provided however
 
9.5 . No Participant, beneficiary or other person shall have any right, title or interest in any fund or in any specific asset of the Company or any Affiliate by reason of any award hereunder. There shall be no funding of any benefits which may become payable hereunder. Nothing contained in this Program (or in any document related thereto), nor the creation or adoption of this Program, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Program shall create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or an Affiliate and any Participant, beneficiary or other person. To the extent that a Participant, beneficiary or other person acquires a right to receive payment with respect to an Award hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or other employing entity, as applicable. All amounts payable under this Program shall be paid from the general assets of the Company or employing entity, as applicable, and no special or separate fund or deposit shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts. Nothing in this Program shall be deemed to give any employee any right to participate in this Program except in accordance herewith.
Nature of Program
 
9.6 . This Program shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

In the event that, for any reason, any Units are deemed to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" notwithstanding the foregoing, then, with respect to any such Units, the specified payment date applicable to such Units shall be the year immediately following the end of the Performance Cycle. Shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Unit shall be deemed to be issued in consideration of past services actually rendered by you to the Company or an Affiliate or for its benefit for which you have not previously been compensated or for future services to be rendered, as the case may be, which the Company deems to have a value at least equal to the aggregate par value thereof.

Any shares of Common Stock withheld by the Company hereunder shall not be deemed to have been issued by the Company for any purpose under the Plan and shall remain available for issuance thereunder. The number of shares of Common Stock tendered by you pursuant to this subsection shall be determined by the Company and be valued at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the Tax Obligations arise. To the extent that the number of shares tendered by you pursuant to this subsection is insufficient to satisfy the Tax Obligations, you hereby authorize the Company to deduct from your compensation the additional amount necessary to fully satisfy the Tax Obligations. If the Company chooses not to deduct such amount from your compensation, you agree to pay the Company, in cash or by check, the additional amount necessary to fully satisfy the Tax Obligations. You agree to take any further actions and execute any additional documents as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section V. Notwithstanding Section IV above, no certificates representing the shares of Common Stock shall be delivered to you unless and until you have satisfied your obligations with respect to the full amount of all federal, state and local tax withholding or other employment taxes applicable to you resulting from the payment of the Units earned.

Any amendment of this Program may, in the sole discretion of the Board, be accomplished in a manner calculated to cause such amendment not to constitute an "extension," "renewal" or "modification" (each within the meaning of Code Section 409A) of any RSUs that would cause such RSUs to be considered "nonqualified deferred compensation" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A).

Such proceeds shall thereafter be transferred pursuant to the terms of a QDRO or other agreement between the Eligible Director and Alternate Payee.

Nature of Program
 
5.7 . This Program shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

5.8 . To the extent that this Program constitutes a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date, shall be interpreted and operated in accordance with Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding any provision of this Program to the contrary, in the event that following the grant of any RSUs, the Board determines that any Award does or may violate any of the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Board may adopt such amendments to the Program and any affected Award or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Board determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Program and any such Award from the application of Code Section 409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

8. Any notices provided for in this option or the Plan shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon receipt or, in the case of notices delivered by the Company to
 
you, five (5) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to you at the address specified below or at such other address as you hereafter designate by written notice to the Company.

In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this option and those of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall control.
 
10. The terms of this option shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws.
 
11.

To the extent that this option is nevertheless deemed to be subject to Code Section 409A for any reason, this option shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Grant Date.
