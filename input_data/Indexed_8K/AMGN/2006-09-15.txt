Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 12, 2006, the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Amgen Inc. (the "Company") approved the Third Amendment to the Amgen Retirement and Savings Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2006) (the "Plan") by unanimous written consent. A description of the amendment follows below. The description of the amendment in this report is a summary of the amendment and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the amendment.
Third Amendment to the Retirement and Savings Plan
The Third Amendment to the Plan memorializes the merger of the Retirement and Savings Plan of Amgen Fremont Inc. (the "Amgen Fremont 401(k)") with and into the Plan.
The Company assumed sponsorship of the Amgen Fremont 401(k) effective upon the close of the acquisition of Abgenix, Inc. The Amgen Fremont 401(k) was frozen effective June 30, 2006, as the Amgen Fremont staff members became eligible to participate in the Plan effective July 1, 2006. After June 30, 2006, no new participants or contributions could be added to the Amgen Fremont 401(k).
The Third Amendment provides that (i) Plan and the Amgen Fremont 401(k) will merge effective October 2, 2006, (ii) the assets of the trust under the Amgen Fremont 401(k) shall be transferred to the trustee of the Plan as soon as administratively practicable after October 2, 2006, (iii) the Plan funds into which Amgen Fremont 401(k) account balances will be transferred, provides for the grandfathering of certain Amgen Fremont 401(k) loans, and (iv) generally provides that the benefits, rights and features of the Plan will apply to participants whose balances are transferred from the Amgen Fremont 401(k).
The form of this amendment is set forth with this report as Exhibit 10.1.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
The Amgen Retirement and Savings Plan ("Plan"), as amended and restated effective January 1, 2006, is hereby amended, effective as of October 2, 2006, unless provided otherwise herein, as follows:
 
 
To record this Amendment to the Plan as set forth herein, Amgen Inc. has caused its authorized officer to execute this document this 14th day of September 2006.
