Notice of Meetings
Section 8. .
Quorum and Required Vote for Directors
(a) At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Any shares, the voting of which at said meeting has been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at such meeting. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. All questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present, except for the election of directors, shall, unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange or securities market applicable to the corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to
 
any regulation applicable to the corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of stock of the corporation which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.
(b) .
Required Vote for Directors
(1) . Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; , , that if the Board of Directors determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting (a "Contested Election") by the date that is 10 days prior to the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting as initially announced, each of the directors to be elected at such meeting shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this Section 8, a "majority of the votes cast" shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election. In a Contested Election, stockholders will be entitled to cast votes "for", or to "withhold" votes from, the election of directors but shall not be entitled to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors.
Majority Vote
provided
however
(2) . If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present and at which there was no Contested Election, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors after certification of the election results of the stockholder vote, which resignation shall be contingent upon the Board's acceptance thereof. The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors, or any successor committee thereto, shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days after certification of the election results of the stockholder vote. The Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board of Directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it deems appropriate and relevant, including, without limitation, the reasons that it believes are
Resignation
 
the reasons a majority of the votes cast at the meeting were voted "against" such director's election, the length of service and qualification of the director whose resignation has been tendered, the director's contribution to the corporation, and the corporate governance guidelines of the Board of Directors.
(3) . A director who tenders his or her resignation in accordance with this Section 8 shall not participate in the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If a majority of the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee have tendered their resignations, the Board of Directors shall appoint a committee of independent directors who received the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting for the election of directors to consider the tendered resignations and make recommendations to the Board of Directors. If there are not two such directors, the entire Board of Directors shall act on the tendered resignations; , , that no director nominated for re-election who did not receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at such meeting shall participate in or vote on the decision whether to accept or reject such director's tendered resignation. If an incumbent director's tendered resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve the full term for which he or she was nominated for re-election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. If an incumbent director's tendered resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Section 8, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of these Bylaws or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 16 of these Bylaws.
Acceptance/Rejection of Resignation
provided
however
Section 9. . Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are present either in person or by proxy, or by the chairman of the meeting or the Board of Directors. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings
 
for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
Section 10. . For the purpose of determining those stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting at which it is to be used. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All elections of Directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.
Voting Rights
Section 11. . If shares or other securities having voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of this subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.
Joint Owners of Stock
Section 12. . The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a
List of Stockholders
 
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation. The list of stockholders must also be open to examination at the meeting as required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
Section 13. . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders.

The Secretary, or, in his absence, an Assistant Secretary directed to do so by the Chief Executive Officer, shall act as secretary of the meeting.
(b) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.

further
 
(b) . The corporation shall have the power to indemnify its other employees and other agents as set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Other Employees and Other Agents
(c) . The corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of any such proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding upon receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.
Expenses
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an officer of the corporation in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigate, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (2) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion that, the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director of another corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in which event this paragraph shall not apply.
(d) . Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the corporation and the director or officer
Enforcement
 
who serves in such capacity at any time while this Bylaw and other relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other applicable law, if any, are in effect. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, such person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article XI or otherwise shall be on the corporation.
(e) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws,
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
 
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, as provided by law.
(f) . The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Survival of Rights
(g) . To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.
Insurance
(h) . Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
Amendments
(i) . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

Exhibit 99.1
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.,  Feb. 15, 2007  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) announced today that its Board unanimously voted to approve corporate governance initiatives to declassify the Board of Directors and adopt a majority vote standard for the election of Directors in uncontested elections.
The Board unanimously voted to submit proposals to amend Amgen's certificate of incorporation and bylaws to eliminate the declassification of the Board to stockholders at the 2007 annual meeting. If stockholders approve the proposals by the requisite vote, all directors would stand for election or re-election each year beginning at the Company's annual meeting held after the 2007 annual meeting.
Amgen also announced today that the Board unanimously voted to amend the Company's bylaws to adopt a majority vote standard for the election of directors, beginning with the next election in May 2007. Amgen's amended bylaws require any incumbent nominee for Amgen's Board who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee would then recommend to the Board whether to accept the resignation, and the Board would make a determination within 90 days after certification of the stockholder vote. The Board's decision and rationale for its decision then would be promptly disclosed publicly. The full text of Amgen's amended bylaws is available on Amgen's website at under the "InvestorsCorporate Governance" tab.
