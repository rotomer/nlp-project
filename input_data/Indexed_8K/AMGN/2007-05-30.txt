Section 1  Registrant's Business and Operations
 
On May 24, 2007, Amgen Inc. (the "Company") entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") under which it agreed to sell $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its Senior Floating Rate Notes (the "Floating Rate Notes"), $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of its 5.85% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375% Senior Notes due 2037 (the "2037 Notes" and, together with the Floating Rate Notes and the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc. (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers").
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on May 30, 2007. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $3.98 billion. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Regulation S of the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of August 4, 2003 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York (as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) as trustee (the "Trustee") and an Officers' Certificate dated as of May 30, 2007 (the "Officers' Certificate") establishing the terms of the Notes pursuant thereto. The Indenture is set forth in Exhibit 4.1 of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-107639) filed on August 4, 2003 and is incorporated herein by reference; the Officers' Certificate, including forms of the Notes, is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the descriptions of the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes, respectively.
The Floating Rate Notes will pay interest at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR plus .08% and will be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on August 28, 2007, November 28, 2007, February 28, 2008, May 28, 2008, August 28, 2008 and November 28, 2008. The Floating Rate Notes will mature on November 28, 2008.
The 2017 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.85% per annum and the 2037 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 6.375% per annum, which, in each case, shall be payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1, beginning December 1, 2007. The 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes will mature on June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2037, respectively.
In the event of a change in control triggering event as defined in the Officers Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Company's senior credit facility, its 4.00% Senior Notes due 2009, its 4.85% Senior Notes due 2014, its 0.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2011, and its 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013. The Notes will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness, effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of its subsidiaries' obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and effectively subordinated in right of payment to its secured obligations, to the extent of the assets securing such obligations.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated as of May 30, 2007, with the Initial Purchasers (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Under the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to file a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the notes for a new issue of substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act within 180 days after the closing of the offering of the Notes. The Company has also agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 270 days after the closing of the offering of the Notes and to use its reasonable efforts to consummate the exchange offer within 310 days after the closing of the offering of the Notes. The Company may be required to provide a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the Notes under certain circumstances. If the Company fails to satisfy these obligations, it may be required to pay holders of the Notes an additional amount. A copy of the Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3, is incorporated herein by reference, and is hereby filed; the description of the Registration Rights Agreement in this report is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
On May 29, 2007, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement to repurchase 53,339,035 shares of Common Stock through a purchase agreement between the Company and Merrill Lynch International ("Merrill Lynch"). The agreement allows the Company to repurchase the shares immediately, while Merrill Lynch will purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over time. The initial price per share was $59.96. The Company may receive or be required to remit a price adjustment based upon the price of the Common Stock during the period required for such purchases by Merrill Lynch. The purchase price adjustment is expected to be settled by July 31, 2007.

from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party for such fees and expenses of counsel in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this Section 5 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company and the Holders shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Holders and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Holders' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5(d) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Registrable Securities of such Holder that were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement.
(e) The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which Registrable Securities were sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
