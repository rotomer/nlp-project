Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 26, 2007, Amgen Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").
Three and six months ended June 30, 2007
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R ("SFAS No. 123R") and with the Company's acquisitions of Avidia, Inc. ("Avidia") in October 2006 (the "Avidia Acquisition"), Abgenix, Inc. ("Abgenix") in April 2006 (the "Abgenix Acquisition"), Tularik Inc. ("Tularik") in August 2004 (the "Tularik Acquisition") and Immunex Corporation ("Immunex") in July 2002 (the "Immunex Acquisition"). In addition, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also relate to amounts associated with the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy (the "Manufacturing Charge"), amounts associated with asset impairment charges and related costs primarily associated with reduced capital investments as part of the rationalization of the Company's worldwide manufacturing operations and, to a lesser degree, moderation of the expansion of our research facilities (the "Impairment Charge"), the income tax benefit recognized as a result of resolving certain non-recurring transfer pricing issues with the Internal Revenue Service for prior periods (the "Income Tax Benefit"), as well as the write-off of the pro rata portion of the deferred financing and related costs immediately charged to interest expense as a result of certain holders of our convertible notes due in 2032 exercising their March 1, 2007 put option and the related convertible notes being repaid in cash (the "Convertible Notes Expense").
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales ("COS") expense, research and development ("R&D") expense, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense and diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share were also adjusted to exclude the effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, COS expense was also adjusted to exclude merger related expenses incurred due to the Abgenix Acquisition primarily related to the incremental costs associated with recording inventory acquired at fair value which is in excess of our manufacturing cost (the "Abgenix Merger Expense") and to exclude the impact of the Manufacturing Charge. For the same period, R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets acquired in the Abgenix Acquisition and the Avidia Acquisition (the "R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization") and merger related expenses incurred due to the Tularik Acquisition primarily related to incremental costs associated with retention and/or integration (the "Tularik Merger Expense"). The Company believes that excluding the Abgenix Merger Expense and the Tularik Merger Expense provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the Manufacturing Charge provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such item did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus
 
provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2007, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provisions for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for these periods for the reasons discussed above, the on-going non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Immunex Acquisition (primarily Enbrel
) (the "Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization"), the Impairment Charge and, for the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Convertible Notes Expense. The Company believes that excluding the Impairment Charge and the Convertible Notes Expense provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Three and six months ended June 30, 2006
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and with the Company's acquisitions of Abgenix, Tularik and Immunex.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense and diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per were also adjusted to exclude the effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the on-going non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets acquired in the Abgenix Acquisition (the "Abgenix Intangible Asset Amortization"), the Tularik Merger Expense and the incremental compensation provided to certain Abgenix employees associated with their retention (the "Abgenix Retention Expense"). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, SG&A expense was also adjusted to exclude the Abgenix Retention Expense. The Company believes that excluding the Abgenix Intangible Asset Amortization treats those asset as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company also believes that excluding the Tularik Merger Expense and Abgenix Retention Expense provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2006, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provisions for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, excluding the effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share and the foregoing expense amounts, where applicable, for these periods for the reasons discussed above, the non-cash expense associated with writing off the acquired in-process research and development related to the Abgenix Acquisition (the "Abgenix IPR&D Write-off") and the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization. The Company believes that excluding the Abgenix IPR&D Write-off provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such item did not occur and that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, as a convenience to investors.

Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
 
 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (July 26, 2007)  Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS), excluding stock option expense and certain other expenses, of $1.12 for the second quarter of 2007, an increase of 7 percent compared to $1.05 during the second quarter of 2006. Adjusted net income, excluding stock option expense and certain other expenses, increased 2 percent to $1,265 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $1,235 million in the second quarter of 2006. Stock option expense on a per share basis totaled 3 cents and 4 cents in the second quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Total revenue increased 3 percent during the second quarter of 2007 to $3,728 million versus $3,604 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Adjusted EPS and adjusted net income for the second quarter 2007 and 2006 exclude stock option expense, certain expenses related to acquisitions, asset impairments and certain other items. These expenses and other items are itemized on the reconciliation tables below. Adjusted EPS including the impact of stock option expense is also itemized on the reconciliation tables below.
 
Amgen's Second Quarter Revenue Increased 3 Percent to $3.7 Billion; Second Quarter Adjusted EPS Increased 7 Percent to $1.12

On a reported basis and calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amgen's GAAP EPS was $0.90 in the second quarter of 2007 and includes $289 million of pre-tax charges for asset impairment and related costs. As part of the Company's global review of its business plans, management decided to make changes to various ongoing capital projects. These decisions were primarily focused on rationalizing the Company's network of manufacturing facilities in order to gain cost efficiencies while continuing to meet product demand. In particular, these decisions include a re-scoping of Ireland manufacturing operations, the construction of which was previously reported to have been delayed, certain revisions to planned manufacturing expansion in Puerto Rico and, to a lesser degree, moderated expansion of research facilities. Amgen's GAAP EPS in the second quarter of 2006 was 1 cent and included a $1.1 billion non-tax deductible write-off of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisition of Abgenix, which closed on April 1, 2006. Amgen's GAAP net income increased to $1,019 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $14 million in the second quarter of 2006.
"This has been a difficult period and this quarter's low growth is a reflection of that reality," said Kevin Sharer, chairman & CEO. "That said, we are making progress on many fronts to change this trend and return Amgen to strong future performance."
Product Sales Performance
During the second quarter, total product sales increased 3 percent to $3,604 million from $3,491 million in the second quarter of 2006. Sales in the U.S. totaled $2,879 million, an increase of 1 percent versus $2,861 million in the second quarter of 2006. International sales increased 15 percent to $725 million versus $630 million for the second quarter of 2006. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter 2007 international sales by $41 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total product sales increased 2 percent and international product sales increased 9 percent.
Worldwide sales of Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) decreased 10 percent to $949 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $1,055 million during the second quarter of 2006. This was principally driven by a decline in U.S. demand. U.S. Aranesp sales were $578 million versus $713 million in the second quarter of the prior year, a decrease of 19 percent, reflecting customer reaction to label and reimbursement changes and to a lesser degree unfavorable wholesaler inventory changes offset by end-user inventory build. International Aranesp sales increased 8 percent to $371 million versus $342 million in the second quarter of 2006, primarily due to changes in foreign exchange which positively impacted second quarter 2007 sales by approximately $21 million. In Europe, growth due to increased demand in the nephrology segment was partially offset by slight dosing conservatism in the oncology segment. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, worldwide product sales decreased 12 percent and international sales increased 2 percent.

Sales of EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa) increased 2 percent to $624 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $613 million in the second quarter of 2006. Growth due to patient population growth, positive revised estimates of dialysis demand (spillover) for prior quarters and favorable wholesaler inventory changes was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in dose / utilization and unfavorable changes in customer purchasing patterns versus the second quarter of the prior year. Spillover is a result of the Company's contractual relationship with Johnson & Johnson (please refer to the Company's Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of this relationship and a description of spillover).
Combined worldwide sales of Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim), increased 4 percent to $1,041 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $1,005 million for the second quarter of 2006, driven primarily by increased international demand for Neulasta. Combined sales of Neulasta and NEUPOGEN in the U.S. were $773 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $785 million in the second quarter of 2006, a decrease of 2 percent reflecting unfavorable wholesaler inventory changes and increased discounts that offset growth in unit demand. Combined international sales increased 22 percent to $268 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $220 million for the same quarter in the prior year, reflecting both the continued conversion to Neulasta and changes in foreign exchange which positively impacted second quarter 2007 combined international sales by approximately $16 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, combined worldwide sales increased 2 percent and international product sales increased 15 percent.
Sales of Enbrel (etanercept) increased 14 percent in the second quarter to $823 million versus $724 million during the same period in 2006 reflecting an increase in demand due to increases in both patients and net sales price. Sales growth continued in both rheumatology and dermatology, driven by segment growth that was partially offset by slight share declines versus the second quarter of the prior year. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both segments.
Worldwide sales of Sensipar (cinacalcet HCl) increased 37 percent to $108 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $79 million during the second quarter of 2006. This growth was principally driven by demand.
Vectibix
TM
(panitumumab) sales for the second quarter were $45 million as compared to $51 million in the first quarter of 2007. This decrease was driven by customer reaction to unfavorable PACCE study results released late in the first quarter of 2007 and a decline in EGFr class growth in metastatic colorectal cancer.
Operating Expense Analysis on an Adjusted Basis:
increased 11 percent to $546 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $492 million in the second quarter of 2006. This increase is primarily driven by product mix, owing to higher ENBREL sales, which is more costly to manufacture, as well as some unusual items. These include an increase in inventory reserves due to expiry risk associated with declining demand in some smaller products and excess inventory related to the introduction of a new product presentation.
Cost of sales

Page 4
 
expenses increased 7 percent to $777 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $729 million in the second quarter of 2006. The second quarter increase was primarily to support the increased number and expense of studies to advance the Company's late-stage pipeline, including previously initiated mega-trials, as well as the continued advancement of earlier stage compounds.
R&D
expenses increased 5 percent to $840 million in the second quarter of 2007 versus $799 million in the second quarter of 2006. The increase is principally due to higher Wyeth profit share expenses related to ENBREL sales growth. SG&A expense growth is essentially flat year-over-year excluding higher Wyeth profit share expenses.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
During the second quarter of 2007, adjusted EPS growth of 7 percent exceeded revenue growth of 3 percent by 4 percentage points. Adjusted EPS leverage for the second quarter was principally driven by fewer shares used in the computation of adjusted diluted EPS and a lower adjusted tax rate. The adjusted tax rate was lower in the second quarter versus the same period in 2006 due to a favorable audit settlement in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, the R&D tax credit was retroactively reinstated late in 2006 and expanded effective in 2007. The second quarter of 2006 adjusted tax rate did not reflect any benefit from the R&D credit.
During the second quarter of 2007, Amgen repurchased approximately 77 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $4.5 billion. In July 2007, Amgen's Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of $5.0 billion. The Company currently has $6.5 billion remaining under this and the previously authorized stock repurchase program. Average diluted shares for adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2007 were 1,132 million versus 1,181 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2007 were approximately $402 million versus $233 million in the second quarter of 2006. Worldwide cash and marketable securities were $5.3 billion and debt was $11.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2007.
The Company indicated that current sales and expense trends are consistent with a full year 2007 adjusted EPS target of $4.30. However, the recent acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa are expected to reduce adjusted EPS by 2 cents, to $4.28. The outcome of key events, including the National Coverage Determination (NCD) and Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) meeting, may affect the outlook for full-year 2007, and the Company will provide updates as appropriate.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. The Company's results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments (domestic or foreign) involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products (domestic or foreign) and difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. In addition, sales of our products are affected by reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payors, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and health care cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and products liability claims. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers.
