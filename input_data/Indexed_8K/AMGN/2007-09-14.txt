ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
On September 11, 2007, an amendment to the promissory note entered into between Richard D. Nanula and Amgen Inc. (the "Company") on June 27, 2001 (the "Note") became effective. The principal amount of the Note is $3,000,000 and the interest rate is 5% per annum. Per the Note's terms, Mr. Nanula has not yet repaid any of the principal. The amendment to the Note allows Mr. Nanula to defer the payment of the entire $3,000,000 principal as well as accrued interest at 5% per annum, compounded annually, until June 27, 2010.
The amendment to the Note does not extend the final repayment date and also does not forgive Mr. Nanula's obligation to repay any principal or interest under the Note. Without an amendment, the original terms of the Note would have required payment in three equal annual installments of principal plus accrued interest at a rate of 5% per annum beginning one year after Mr. Nanula's termination date of July 31, 2007, and ending in 2010.
The Company previously reported Mr. Nanula's resignation from the Company.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
