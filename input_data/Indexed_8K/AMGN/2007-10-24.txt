Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 24, 2007, Amgen Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("non-GAAP") financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2007
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R ("SFAS No. 123R"), charges related to the Company's restructuring plan announced in August 2007 which include (i) severance and other separation costs partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued expenses for bonuses and stock-based compensation awards, which will be forfeited as a result of the employees' termination, (ii) asset impairment charges incurred in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide manufacturing operations in order to gain cost efficiencies and, to a lesser degree, the moderation of the expansion of our research facilities, (iii) accelerated depreciation resulting from our decision to accelerate closure of one of our Enbrel commercial bulk production operations in connection with the rationalization of our worldwide network of manufacturing facilities, (iv) cost recoveries for certain restructuring expenses principally with respect to accelerated depreciation in connection with our co-promotion agreement with Wyeth and (v) charges principally related to loss accruals for leases for certain research and development facilities that will not be used in our business (collectively, the "Restructuring Charges") and charges related to the Company's acquisitions of Alantos Pharmaceutical Holding, Inc. ("Alantos") in July 2007 (the "Alantos Acquisition"), Ilypsa, Inc. ("Ilypsa") in July 2007 (the "Ilypsa Acquisition"), Avidia, Inc. ("Avidia") in October 2006 (the "Avidia Acquisition"), Abgenix, Inc. ("Abgenix") in April 2006 (the "Abgenix Acquisition"), Tularik Inc. ("Tularik") in August 2004 (the "Tularik Acquisition") and Immunex Corporation ("Immunex") in July 2002 (the "Immunex Acquisition"). In addition, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also relate to amounts associated with the write-off of inventory principally due to changing regulatory and reimbursement environments (the "Inventory Charge"), the write-off of the cost of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that will not be used due to a change in manufacturing strategy (the "Manufacturing Charge"), the income tax benefit recognized as a result of resolving certain non-routine transfer pricing issues with the Internal Revenue Service for prior periods (the "Income Tax Benefit"), the write-off of the pro rata portion of the deferred financing and related costs immediately charged to interest expense as a result of certain holders of our convertible notes due in 2032 exercising their March 1, 2007 put option and the related convertible notes being repaid in cash (the "Convertible Notes Expense") as well as the tax effect of the adjustments discussed below excluding certain of the Restructuring Charges, certain components of the Inventory Charge, the non-cash expense associated with writing-off acquired in-process research and development related to the Alantos Acquisition and the Ilypsa Acquisition (the "Alantos and Ilypsa Acquisition IPR&D Expense"), the Manufacturing Charge and the Income Tax Benefit (the "2007 Tax Effect").
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) ("COS") expense, research and development ("R&D") expense, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense and diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the Restructuring Charges. Diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share were also adjusted to exclude the effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before
 
and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the Restructuring Charges provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, COS expense was also adjusted to exclude the Inventory Charge and for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, COS expense was also adjusted to exclude merger related expenses incurred due to the Abgenix Acquisition, primarily related to the incremental costs associated with recording inventory acquired at fair value which is in excess of our manufacturing cost (the "Abgenix Merger Expense") and the impact of the Manufacturing Charge. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets acquired with the Abgenix Acquisition and the Avidia Acquisition (the "R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization") and merger related expenses incurred due to the Alantos Acquisition, the Ilypsa Acquisition and the Tularik Acquisition primarily related to incremental costs associated with retention and/or integration (the "Merger Retention Expense"). The Company believes that excluding the Abgenix Merger Expense and the Merger Retention Expense provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the Inventory Charge and the Manufacturing Charge provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provisions for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude all of the items identified above for the applicable periods for the reasons discussed above, the Restructuring Charges, the Alantos and Ilypsa Acquisition IPR&D Expense, the ongoing non-cash amortization of acquired intangible assets, primarily ENBREL, related to the Immunex Acquisition (the "Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization"), the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex Acquisition (the "Impairment Charge") and the 2007 Tax Effect. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the Convertible Notes Expense and the Income Tax Benefit. The Company believes that excluding the Restructuring Charges provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred The Company believes that excluding the Alantos and Ilypsa Acquisition IPR&D Expense, the Impairment Charge, the Convertible Notes Expense, the Income Tax Benefit and the 2007 Tax Effect provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2006
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and charges related to the Abgenix Acquisition, the Tularik Acquisition and the Immunex Acquisition and the tax effect for the adjustments discussed below excluding the non-cash expense associated with writing-off the acquired in-process research and development related to the Abgenix acquisition (the "Abgenix Acquisition IPR&D Expense") (the "2006 Tax Effect").
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense and diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R. Diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share were also adjusted to exclude the effects of adopting SFAS No. 123R. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effect of adopting SFAS No. 123R provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible asset acquired in the Abgenix Acquisition (the "Abgenix R&D Technology Intangible Asset Amortization"). For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, R&D expense and SG&A expense were also adjusted to exclude merger related expenses incurred due to the Tularik Acquisition and Abgenix Acquisition primarily related to the incremental costs associated with retention and/or integration (the "2006 Merger Retention Expense") The Company believes that excluding the Abgenix R&D Technology Intangible Asset Amortization treats the asset as if the Company had developed it internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2006 Merger Retention Expense provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provisions for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude all of the items identified above for the reasons discussed above, the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization, the Impairment Charge and the 2006 Tax Effect. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the Abgenix Acquisition IPR&D Expense. The Company believes that excluding the Abgenix Acquisition IPR&D Expense, the Impairment Charge and the 2006 Tax Effect provides supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, as a convenience to investors.

Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Oct. 24, 2007)  Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS), excluding stock option expense and certain other expenses, of $1.08 for the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 4 percent compared to $1.04 for the third quarter of 2006. Adjusted net income, excluding stock option expense and certain other expenses, decreased 4 percent to $1,181 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $1,224 million in the third quarter of 2006. Stock option expense on a per share basis totaled 2 cents and 3 cents for the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Total revenue remained unchanged during the third quarter of 2007 at $3.6 billion versus the third quarter of 2006.
Adjusted EPS and adjusted net income for the third quarter 2007 and 2006 exclude stock option expense, certain expenses related to acquisitions, restructuring charges and certain other items. These expenses and other items are itemized on the attached reconciliation tables. Adjusted EPS including the impact of stock option expense are also itemized on the attached reconciliation tables.
On a reported basis and calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amgen's GAAP EPS were $0.18 and GAAP net income

Page 2
 
was $201 million for the third quarter of 2007. These amounts are down from the prior year GAAP EPS of $0.94 and GAAP net income of $1.1 billion. GAAP reported results for the third quarter of 2007 were negatively impacted by the write-off of $590 million of acquired in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of Alantos and Ilypsa; $293 million of charges principally related to asset impairment, accelerated depreciation, staff separation costs and accruals for losses on leased facilities in connection with the previously announced restructuring plan; and the write-off of $90 million of inventory principally due to the changing regulatory and reimbursement environments.
As a result of the regulatory and reimbursement changes to Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) products and their impact on the Company's operations, in particular Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa), on Aug. 15, 2007, Amgen announced plans to restructure worldwide operations in order to improve its cost structure while continuing to make significant innovative research and development investments and build the framework for future growth. In connection with this restructuring plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $775 million to $850 million in total restructuring charges (as compared to the prior estimate of $600 million to $700 million). The increase in the total estimated restructuring charges is primarily the result of additional rationalization of manufacturing facilities, including the indefinite postponement of planned manufacturing operations in Ireland and the closure of a clinical manufacturing facility in Thousand Oaks. Through Sept. 30, 2007, Amgen has incurred $582 million of restructuring charges and anticipates that the remaining estimated charges will be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007 and, to a lesser degree, in 2008.
"Sales of our ESA products were adversely affected by regulatory and reimbursement changes," said Kevin Sharer, chairman & CEO. "We are making good progress in implementing a global restructuring plan to rationalize our cost structure and improve cash flow, while continuing to invest in the future."
Product Sales Performance
During the third quarter, total product sales increased 1 percent to $3,524 million from $3,503 million in the third quarter of 2006. Sales in the U.S. totaled $2,809 million, a decline of 2 percent versus $2,864 million in the third quarter of 2006. International sales increased 12 percent to $715 million versus $639 million in the third quarter of 2006. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted third quarter 2007 international sales by $46 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total product sales decreased 1 percent and international product sales increased 5 percent.
Worldwide sales of Aranesp decreased 23 percent to $818 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $1,067 million in the third quarter of 2006. This was principally driven by a decline in U.S. demand. U.S. Aranesp sales were $460 million versus $720 million in the third quarter of the prior year, a decrease of 36 percent. This was due to a decline in demand primarily reflecting reaction to regulatory and reimbursement developments throughout the year, including the National Coverage Determination (NCD) issued by the

Page 3
 
Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on July 30. To a lesser extent, this also reflects a decline in segment share versus the third quarter of the prior year. International Aranesp sales increased 3 percent to $358 million versus $347 million in the third quarter of 2006, due to changes in foreign exchange which positively impacted third quarter 2007 sales by approximately $24 million. In Europe, growth was negatively impacted by dosing conservatism in the oncology segment and price pressure across the ESA class. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, worldwide Aranesp sales decreased 26 percent and international sales decreased 4 percent.
Sales of EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa) decreased 5 percent to $602 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $633 million in the third quarter of 2006. This was primarily driven by a decline in dose / utilization and increased discounts versus the third quarter of the prior year, partially offset by patient population growth of 3 percent. The decline in dose / utilization reflects reaction to regulatory and reimbursement developments throughout the year, including final KDOQI guidelines, revised labeling and pending EMP update.
Combined worldwide sales of Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim), increased 10 percent to $1,100 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $998 million in the third quarter of 2006. Combined sales of Neulasta and NEUPOGEN in the U.S. were $830 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $772 million in the third quarter of 2006, an increase of 8 percent primarily driven by favorable wholesaler inventory changes. Combined international sales increased 19 percent to $270 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $226 million for the same quarter in the prior year, reflecting both increased conversion to Neulasta versus the third quarter of the prior year and changes in foreign exchange which positively impacted third quarter 2007 combined international sales by $18 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, combined worldwide sales increased 8 percent and international product sales increased 12 percent.
Sales of Enbrel (etanercept) increased 16 percent in the third quarter of 2007 to $821 million versus $705 million during the same period in 2006 driven by an increase in demand due to increases in both patients and net sales price. Sales growth continued in both rheumatology and dermatology, driven by segment growth that was partially offset by slight share declines versus the third quarter of the prior year. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both segments.
Worldwide sales of Sensipar (cinacalcet HCl) increased 47 percent to $122 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $83 million in the third quarter of 2006. This growth was principally driven by demand.
Vectibix
TM
(panitumumab) sales for the third quarter were $41 million as compared to $45 million in the second quarter of 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by reaction to unfavorable Panitumumab Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation (PACCE) study results released late in the first quarter of 2007.

Operating Expense Analysis on an Adjusted Basis:
increased 21 percent to $585 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $485 million in the third quarter of 2006. This increase is primarily driven by product mix, due to higher sales of ENBREL, which is more costly to manufacture, as well as certain other items. These include an excess capacity charge at the Company's manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico and the write-off of excess inventory primarily related to certain new product presentations. Excess capacity charges are expected to continue to occur through 2008. Cost of sales margin throughout this period is expected to be similar to the third quarter of 2007 due to excess capacity charges and product mix.
Cost of sales
expenses decreased 16 percent to $699 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $835 million in the third quarter of 2006. R&D expenses were lower primarily due to optimization of ongoing trials, lower in-licensing expenses primarily due to two deals in the third quarter of 2006 and the benefit derived from licensing denosumab in Japan to Daiichi Sankyo. R&D expenses are expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. For the full year, R&D expenses are expected to be below 2006 levels.
Research & Development (R&D)
expenses increased 3 percent to $804 million in the third quarter of 2007 versus $782 million in the third quarter of 2006. The increase was principally due to higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and higher Wyeth profit share expenses due to ENBREL sales growth partially offset by lower promotion and advertising spending on marketed products. SG&A expense growth was essentially flat year-over-year excluding higher Wyeth profit share expenses. As in the past, SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, though not as much as in 2006.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
During the third quarter of 2007, adjusted EPS grew 4 percent while revenue remained unchanged. Adjusted EPS leverage of 4 percentage points for the third quarter was principally driven by fewer shares used in the computation of adjusted diluted EPS partially offset by higher interest expense.
Average diluted shares for adjusted EPS in the third quarter of 2007 were 1,089 million versus 1,174 million in the third quarter of 2006.
Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2007 were approximately $306 million versus $376 million in the third quarter of 2006. Capital expenditures for the full year 2007 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion versus $1.2 billion in the full year 2006. Worldwide cash and marketable securities were $6.0 billion and debt was $11.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2007.
The Company reaffirmed its 2007 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.13 to $4.23 excluding stock option expense and certain other expenses.

Third Quarter Product and Pipeline Update
The Company provided updates on selected late-stage clinical programs including Aranesp, Vectibix, ENBREL, romiplostim (formerly known as AMG 531) and denosumab.
The Company provided an update on its discussions with regulatory agencies regarding product labeling revisions to its ESA products. The Company is working closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to complete revisions to its U.S. labels based on both the Oncologics Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) and Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) recommendations. As previously announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has communicated a proposal for amending prescribing information for ESAs in the European Union (E.U.), including Aranesp. The proposed amendments are expected to be finalized by the end of the year.
Aranesp:
The Company previously announced that the CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending Vectibix for conditional approval in the E.U. for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with non-mutated (wild-type) genes. The Company will continue to integrate and other biomarker analyses into its ongoing clinical program studying Vectibix in earlier lines of mCRC therapy in combination with chemotherapy, as well as in other tumor types. As a result, the protocols of the Phase 3 studies of Vectibix in the treatment of 1
Vectibix:
KRAS
KRAS
st
and 2
nd
line colorectal cancer are being amended. As part of these modifications, the Company plans to increase enrollment in both studies which will extend the completion of these studies versus previously planned timelines. These study changes are expected to allow the Company to assess the utility of Vectibix in patients with and without mutant -bearing tumors.
KRAS
The Company also announced that they and the FDA have adopted changes to the U.S. prescribing information for Vectibix based on the results of the PACCE trial. The update is intended to highlight to clinicians the greater risk seen when Vectibix is combined with Avastin and the specific chemotherapy used in the PACCE trial to treat patients with 1
st
line mCRC. Vectibix is not indicated for the 1
st
line treatment of mCRC and the new safety information applies to an unapproved use of Vectibix.
The Company and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of Wyeth, have submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for the use of ENBREL in treating pediatric patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who have tried another therapy. If approved by the FDA, ENBREL is expected to be the first biologic, as well as the first systemic medication, indicated to treat this disease in pediatric patients.
ENBREL:

The Company has filed for FDA approval of romiplostim for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and expects to file in the E.U., Canada and Australia by the end of 2007. Romiplostim successfully met all key endpoints in its pivotal Phase 3 studies and data from both studies as well as a long-term extension study will be presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) later this year.
Romiplostim (AMG 531):
Denosumab is still on target for review of the entire Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (PMO) data set in the second half of 2008. The Company disclosed that its Phase 2 PMO study in Japan met its primary and secondary endpoints.
Denosumab:
