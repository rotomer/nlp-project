Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 28, 2008, Amgen entered into a variable term accelerated share repurchase transaction with Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (the "ASR Agreement"). The repurchase transaction constitutes a part of Amgen's previously announced stock repurchase programs. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, Amgen repurchased from Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. approximately 31.5 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate initial price of $1.5 billion. Under the ASR Agreement, Amgen may receive or be required to pay a purchase price adjustment following the completion of the transaction. The purchase price adjustment will be based on the volume-weighted average price per share of Amgen's common stock during the term of the transaction. The purchase price adjustments can be settled, at the option of Amgen, in shares of its common stock or in cash.
