On July 11, 2008, Amgen Inc. ("Amgen" or the "Company") announced that it had reached an agreement to settle its outstanding antitrust litigation with Ortho Biotech Products, L.P. ("Ortho Biotech"). Ortho Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson ("J&J"), had alleged that discounts offered to oncology clinics on Amgen's NEUPOGEN and Neulasta and Aranesp products violated antitrust laws. Under terms of the agreement, Amgen will pay Ortho Biotech $200 million and the pending litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey will be dismissed with prejudice. The Company continues to deny that its challenged conduct was unlawful, and admits to no wrongdoing as part of the settlement agreement.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
