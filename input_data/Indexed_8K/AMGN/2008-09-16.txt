On September 16, 2008, the Company will present additional data from its pivotal fracture trial (the "Pivotal Fracture Trial") evaluating its receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) Ligand inhibitor, denosumab, in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This data will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research in Montreal, Canada, and may include data set forth in this Periodic Report on Form 8-K.
: In the Pivotal Fracture Trial, 7,808 women with osteoporosis were randomized to receive either a 60 mg subcutaneous injection of denosumab (N=3,902) or a matching placebo injection (N=3,906) every 6 months for three years. The mean age of the study participants was 72.3 years, and the mean baseline Bone Mineral Density (BMD) T-scores of the subjects was -2.8 at the lumbar spine, -1.9 at the total hip and -2.2 at the femoral neck. Approximately 24% of subjects had prevalent vertebral fractures at baseline. Approximately 83% of the subjects completed the three-year study (denosumab N=3,272; placebo N=3,206). Through month 36 of the study, treatment with 60 mg of denosumab every six months reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures by 68% versus placebo (2.3% denosumab versus 7.2% placebo; P<0.0001), a statistically significant result. Treatment with denosumab also reduced hip fracture risk by 40% (0.7% denosumab versus 1.2% placebo, P=0.036) and nonvertebral fracture risk by 20% (6.5% denosumab versus 8.0% placebo, P=0.011) during the 36 month period, both statistically significant results. Adverse events reported included infections characterized as adverse events (52.9% denosumab, 54.4% placebo), infections characterized as serious adverse events (4.1% denosumab, N=159; 3.4% placebo, N=133), delayed fracture healing (0.1% denosumab, N=2; 0.1% placebo, N=3), stroke (1.4% denosumab, N=56; 1.4% placebo, N=54), coronary heart disease events (1.2% denosumab, N=47; 1.0% placebo, N=39), atrial fibrillation characterized as serious adverse events (0.7% denosumab, N=29; 0.7% placebo, N=29) and new primary malignancy (2.4% denosumab, N=93; 2.2% placebo, N=84). Adverse events reported for at least 2% of subjects and for which P<0.05 included fall (denosumab 5.3%, N=205; placebo 6.4%, N=250) and flatulence (denosumab 2.2%, N=84; placebo 1.4%, N=53), and serious adverse events reported for at least 0.1% of subjects and for which P<0.01 included concussion (denosumab <0.1%, N=1; placebo 0.3%, N=11) and erysipelas (denosumab 0.2%, N=7; placebo 0%, N=0). Additionally, deaths occurred in 1.8% of the denosumab subjects (N=70) and 2.3% of the placebo subjects (N=90). No cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw, or ONJ, were seen in either study group.
