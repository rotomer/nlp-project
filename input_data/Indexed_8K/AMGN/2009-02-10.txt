Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On February 4, 2009, Amgen Inc. ("Amgen" or the "Company") entered into a services agreement (the "Agreement") with Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc.

The Agreement has an initial term of five years and automatically renews thereafter for one-year renewal terms unless notice of non-renewal is provided by the Company. The costs to the Company for the initial five-year term are estimated to be approximately $500 million. Among other rights to terminate the agreement for cause or change of control of the Provider, the Company may terminate the Agreement at its convenience by paying Provider certain costs of Provider associated with the termination with the amount of such costs dependent upon termination fees of subcontracted work and undepreciated value of equipment and materials used by Provider to provide the services.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
