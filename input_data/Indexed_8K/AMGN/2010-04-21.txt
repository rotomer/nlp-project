Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 21, 2010, Amgen Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended March 31, 2010. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("non-GAAP") financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to March 31, 2010 and for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").
As of March 31, 2010
As of March 31, 2010, the Company also reported a non-GAAP financial measure for total outstanding debt which excluded the impact of adopting a new accounting standard on the carrying values of its convertible notes. The Company believes that excluding the impact of this accounting standard on its total outstanding debt provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after its convertible notes are outstanding.
Three months ended March 31, 2010
For the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with: the impact of expensing stock options; the Company's acquisitions of Avidia, Inc. in October 2006 (the "Avidia Acquisition"), Abgenix, Inc. in April 2006 (the "Abgenix Acquisition") and Immunex Corporation in July 2002 (the "Immunex Acquisition"); the net benefit arising from settlements of certain legal proceedings (the "2010 Legal Accruals"); the incremental non-cash interest expense resulting from a change in the accounting for our convertible notes effective January 1, 2009 (the "Non-Cash Interest Expense"); and the tax effect of the adjustments in 2010, discussed below (the "2010 Tax Effect").
For the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) ("COS") expense, research and development ("R&D") expense, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense, interest expense, net ("Interest expense, net") and diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets with alternative future uses acquired with the Abgenix Acquisition and the Avidia Acquisition (the "R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization"). Interest expense, net was adjusted to exclude the Non-Cash Interest Expense. Diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share were adjusted to exclude the related effects of expensing stock options. The Company believes that excluding the impact and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the Non-Cash Interest Expense provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expense is incurred.
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2010, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the related effects of expensing stock options on diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the reasons discussed above, the ongoing, non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights related to the Immunex Acquisition (primarily Enbrel) (the "Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization"), the 2010 Legal Accruals and the 2010 Tax Effect. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2010 Legal Accruals provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such item did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the 2010 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
Three months ended March 31, 2009
For the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with: the impact of expensing stock options, the Avidia Acquisition, the Abgenix Acquisition and the Immunex Acquisition, the Company's restructuring plan announced in August 2007 and the additional cost saving initiatives subsequently identified (the "2009 Restructuring Amounts"), the Non-Cash Interest Expense, the tax effect of the adjustments in 2009 discussed below (the "2009 Tax Effect") and the net tax benefit resulting from adjustments to previously established deferred taxes, primarily related to prior acquisitions and stock option expense, due to changes in California tax law effective for future periods (the "State Tax Adjustment").
For the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense, Interest expense, net and diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization. SG&A expense was also adjusted to exclude the 2009 Restructuring Amounts. Interest expense, net was adjusted to exclude the Non-Cash Interest Expense. Diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share were adjusted to exclude the related effects of expensing stock options. The Company believes that excluding the impact and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2009 Restructuring Amounts and the Non-Cash Interest Expense provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three months ended March 31, 2009, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the related effects of expensing stock options on diluted shares used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the reasons discussed above, the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization, the 2009 Restructuring Amounts, the 2009 Tax Effect and the State Tax Adjustment. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2009 Restructuring Amounts provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2009 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons
 
before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred. The Company believes that excluding the State Tax Adjustment provides a supplemental measure that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such item did not occur.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, as a convenience to investors.

Exhibit 99.1
 
News Release
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (April 21, 2010)  Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 20 percent compared to $1.08 for the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted net income increased 14 percent to $1,282 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $1,120 million for the first quarter of 2009.
Total revenue increased 9 percent for the first quarter of 2010 to $3,592 million versus $3,308 million for the first quarter of 2009.
"We are off to a good start in 2010 with solid first-quarter results," said Kevin Sharer, Chairman & CEO. "We are optimistic about Prolia in the U.S. and EU and will take appropriate steps to manage the impact of the new U.S. health care reform law."
Adjusted EPS and adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009 exclude, for the applicable periods, stock option expense, certain expenses related to acquisitions, non-cash interest expense resulting from a change in accounting in the first quarter of 2009 for our convertible notes and certain other items. These expenses and other items are presented on the attached reconciliation tables.

FIRST QUARTER REVENUE INCREASED 9 PERCENT TO $3.6 BILLION

On a reported basis and calculated in accordance with United States (U.S.) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amgen's GAAP EPS were $1.18 for the first quarter of 2010, a 20 percent increase compared to $0.98 for the first quarter of 2009. GAAP net income increased 15 percent to $1,167 million for the first quarter of 2010 from $1,019 million for the first quarter of 2009.
Product Sales Performance
Total product sales for the first quarter of 2010, increased 9 percent to $3,528 million from $3,238 million for the first quarter of 2009. Sales in the U.S. totaled $2,677 million, an increase of 7 percent versus $2,502 million for the first quarter of 2009. First quarter 2010 U.S. product sales include a $33 million accrual for certain Health Care Reform Legislation provisions that were fully or partially in effect during the first quarter. International sales increased 16 percent to $851 million versus $736 million for the first quarter of 2009. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted first quarter 2010 sales by $39 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, total product sales increased 8 percent and international product sales increased 10 percent.
Worldwide sales of Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) were relatively unchanged for the first quarter of 2010 at $627 million versus $626 million for the first quarter of 2009. In the U.S., Aranesp sales decreased 8 percent to $268 million for the first quarter of 2010 versus $292 million for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease was principally driven by a decline in demand partially offset by favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. The decline in demand was due to a low double digit percentage point decline in units sold, due in part to a slight loss of segment share, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in average net sales price. International Aranesp sales increased 7 percent to $359 million versus $334 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange, which aggregated approximately $16 million, and to a lesser extent, an increase in demand. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, worldwide Aranesp sales decreased 2 percent and international product sales increased 3 percent.
Sales of EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa) increased 10 percent to $623 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $565 million in the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to an increase in demand. The increase in demand was principally due to increased dose utilization, and to a lesser extent, patient population growth.
Combined worldwide sales of Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim) increased 10 percent to $1,179 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $1,073 million for the first quarter of 2009. Combined sales of Neulasta and NEUPOGEN in the U.S. were $862 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus

FIRST QUARTER REVENUE INCREASED 9 PERCENT TO $3.6 BILLION
Page 3
 
$796 million in the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 8 percent due primarily to favorable changes in wholesaler inventories and an increase in demand. The increase in demand was driven by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in average net sales price, partially off-set by a slight decline in units sold. Combined international sales increased 14 percent to $317 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $277 million for the first quarter of 2009. This growth reflects increased demand, driven by the continued conversion from NEUPOGEN to Neulasta and expansion into newer territories, and changes in foreign exchange which positively impacted first quarter sales by approximately $16 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, combined worldwide product sales of NEUPOGEN and Neulasta increased 8 percent and international product sales increased 9 percent.
Sales of Enbrel (etanercept) increased 6 percent in the first quarter of 2010 to $804 million versus $758 million for the first quarter of 2009, driven primarily by favorable changes in wholesaler inventories and an increase in demand. This increase in demand was principally due to a low single-digit percentage point increase in average net sales price, partially offset by a slight decline in units sold reflecting a share decline as a result of increased competitive activity in dermatology. ENBREL continues to maintain a leading position in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.
Worldwide sales of Sensipar (cinacalcet) increased 21 percent to $179 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $148 million during the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of increased international demand, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in U.S. wholesaler inventories.
Vectibix (panitumumab) sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $67 million compared to $53 million for the first quarter of 2009. Sales growth was driven by international demand as a result of recent launches.
Operating Expense Analysis on an Adjusted Basis:
decreased to 14.3 percent of sales for the first quarter of 2010 versus 14.6 percent of sales for the first quarter of 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by lower bulk material cost, lower royalties, higher average net sales price and favorable foreign exchange, largely offset by less favorable product mix.
Cost of sales
expenses increased 2 percent to $617 million for the first quarter of 2010 versus $605 million for the first quarter of 2009. This increase was primarily driven by higher staff-related costs and lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations, which were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs primarily for the denosumab skeletal-related events studies.
Research and Development (R&D)
 
AMGEN'S FIRST QUARTER ADJUSTED EPS INCREASED 20 PERCENT TO $1.30;
FIRST QUARTER REVENUE INCREASED 9 PERCENT TO $3.6 BILLION
Page 4
 
expenses increased 13 percent to $873 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus $774 million in the first quarter of 2009. This increase was due to increased spending for activities in anticipation of the approval of Prolia
Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A)
TM
(denosumab), higher expenses associated with the Pfizer profit share due to higher ENBREL sales, higher staff-related costs and higher litigation expenses. These increases were partially offset by expense recoveries related to the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration to commercialize Prolia in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico.
Excluding expenses associated with the Pfizer profit share of $269 million and $248 million for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively, adjusted SG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2010 increased 15 percent versus the first quarter of 2009.
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was 20.0 percent compared to 21.5 percent for the first quarter of 2009. The decrease in the adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was primarily due to increased bulk manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico and the favorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix, partially offset by the lack of benefit from the Federal R&D tax credit in the first quarter of 2010.
During the first quarter of 2010, Amgen repurchased approximately 29 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $1.7 billion. The Company currently has $4.3 billion remaining under its authorized stock repurchase program.
Average diluted shares for adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2010 were 988 million versus 1,037 million for the first quarter of 2009.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2010 were $94 million versus $117 million for the first quarter of 2009. Worldwide cash and marketable securities were $14.1 billion and adjusted outstanding debt was $12.2 billion as of March 31, 2010. The Company's adjusted outstanding debt excludes the impact of a change in accounting on the carrying values of its convertible notes. The Company's outstanding debt presented in accordance with GAAP was $11.7 billion as of March 31, 2010.
2010 Guidance Update
The Company now expects revenues and adjusted EPS for 2010 to be towards the lower end of the current guidance ranges of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion and $5.05 to $5.25, respectively, including an anticipated impact of $200 million to $250 million due to U.S. Health Care Reform. Adjusted EPS excludes stock option expense, certain expenses related to prior acquisitions and the non-cash interest expense resulting from a change in accounting for our convertible notes.
 
AMGEN'S FIRST QUARTER ADJUSTED EPS INCREASED 20 PERCENT TO $1.30;
FIRST QUARTER REVENUE INCREASED 9 PERCENT TO $3.6 BILLION
Page 5
 
The Company still expects the 2010 adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20 percent to 21 percent and capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million.
First Quarter Product and Pipeline Update
The Company provided updates on selected products and clinical programs.
The Company discussed the previously announced results of its pivotal, Phase 3, head-to-head study where denosumab demonstrated superiority versus Zometa (zoledronic acid) in the treatment of skeletal related events in prostate cancer patients with metastatic bone disease.
Denosumab:
The Company also discussed that, on March 18, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has re-issued a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of Prolia for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fractures, and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures. If approved by the European Commission, Amgen would receive marketing authorization for Prolia in all European Union (EU) Member States.
The Company announced that it has submitted its market authorization application for first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer with the EMA.
Vectibix:
The Company also announced that, on April 16, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited has received approval to market Vectibix in Japan for the treatment of unresectable, advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer with wild-type . In 2008 the Company entered into an agreement under which Takeda would develop and commercialize Vectibix for the Japanese market.
