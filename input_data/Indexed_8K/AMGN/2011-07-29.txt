Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 29, 2011, Amgen Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and its unaudited financial position as of June 30, 2011. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to June 30, 2011 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
As of June 30, 2011
As of June 30, 2011, the Company reported a non-GAAP financial measure for total outstanding debt which excluded the impact of adopting a new accounting standard, effective January 1, 2009, on the carrying values of its convertible notes. The Company believes that excluding the impact of this accounting standard on its total outstanding debt provides a supplemental measure of financial condition that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after its convertible notes are outstanding.
Three and six months ended June 30, 2011
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with: the impact of expensing stock options; the Company's acquisitions of Avidia, Inc. in October 2006 (the Avidia Acquisition) and of Immunex Corporation in July 2002 (the Immunex Acquisition); the accelerated depreciation for manufacturing assets resulting from our transaction with Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) involving our manufacturing operations in Fremont, California (the BI Fremont Transaction Accelerated Depreciation Charge); the loss accruals for certain facility operating leases associated with the BI Fremont transaction that will not be used in our business (the BI Fremont Transaction Lease Loss Accruals); the incremental costs associated with the Laboratorio Quimico Farmaceutico Bergamo Ltda (Bergamo) acquisition, related to recording acquired inventory at fair value which is in excess of its historical manufacturing cost (the Bergamo Inventory Cost); merger-related expenses associated with certain of our recent acquisitions related primarily to transaction costs (the 2011 Acquisitions Costs); the expense arising from certain legal settlements (the 2011 Legal Settlements); the expense related to changes in the estimated fair values of the contingent consideration obligations related to the BioVex Group, Inc. (BioVex) acquisition (the BioVex Contingent Consideration Costs); certain charges (or the reversal of certain previously over-accrued charges) pursuant to our continuing efforts to improve cost efficiencies in our manufacturing operations (the 2011 Cost Savings Initiatives); and the incremental non-cash interest expense resulting from a change in the accounting for our convertible notes effective January 1, 2009 (the Non-Cash Interest Expense). For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also relate to amounts associated with the Company's acquisition of Abgenix, Inc. in April 2006 (the Abgenix Acquisition); the expense resulting from the cash settlement of unvested BioVex employee stock options in connection the BioVex acquisition (the BioVex Employee Stock Option Expense); and the income tax benefit related principally to certain prior period charges excluded from non-GAAP earnings (the 2011 Income Tax Benefit). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also include the tax effect of the adjustments in 2011, discussed below, excluding the 2011 Income Tax Benefit (the 2011 Tax Effect).
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) (COS) expense, research and development (R&D) expense, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options. COS expense was also adjusted to exclude the BI Fremont Transaction Accelerated Depreciation Charge, the BI Fremont Transaction Lease Loss Accruals and the Bergamo Inventory Cost. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the ongoing, non-cash amortization of the R&D technology intangible assets with alternative future uses acquired with the Abgenix Acquisition and the Avidia Acquisition (the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization). For the six months ended June 30, 2011, R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the BioVex Employee Stock Option Expense. SG&A expense was also adjusted to exclude the 2011 Acquisitions Costs. Weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share were adjusted to exclude the related effects of expensing stock options. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the BI Fremont Transaction Accelerated Depreciation Charge, the BI Fremont Transaction Lease Loss Accruals and the 2011 Acquisitions Costs provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the Bergamo Inventory Cost and the BioVex Employee Stock Option Expense provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP provisions for income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the related effects of expensing stock options on weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the reasons discussed above, the ongoing, non-cash amortization of acquired product technology rights related to the Immunex Acquisition (primarily Enbrel ) (the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization), the 2011 Legal Settlements, the BioVex Contingent Consideration Costs, the 2011 Cost Savings Initiatives, the Non-Cash Interest Expense and the 2011 Tax Effect. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, non-GAAP provisions for income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share exclude the 2011 Income Tax Benefit. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Legal Settlements, the 2011 Cost Savings Initiatives and the 2011 Income Tax Benefit provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Non-Cash Interest Expense and the BioVex Contingent Consideration Costs provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred. For the three months ended June 30, 2011, the Company also reported a non-GAAP effective tax rate that excludes the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax. The Company believes that excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such item is incurred.
Three and six months ended June 30, 2010
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with: the impact of expensing stock options; the Avidia Acquisition, the Abgenix Acquisition and the Immunex Acquisition; the Non-Cash Interest Expense; and, for the six months ended June 30, 2010, the net benefit arising from settlements of certain legal proceedings (the 2010 Legal Settlements). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also include the tax effect of the adjustments in 2010, discussed below (the 2010 Tax Effect).
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization. Weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share were adjusted to exclude the related effects of expensing stock options. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the Company reported non-GAAP provisions for income taxes, non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the related effects of expensing stock options on weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the reasons discussed above, the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization, the 2010 Legal Settlements, the Non-Cash Interest Expense and the 2010 Tax Effect. The Company believes that excluding the Immunex Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2010 Legal Settlements provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such item did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Non-Cash Interest Expense provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expense is incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2010 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, as a convenience to investors.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(c) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (July 29, 2011)  Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) reported total revenue increased 4 percent during the second quarter of 2011 to $3,959 million versus $3,804 million in the second quarter of 2010. Total product sales increased 8 percent in the second quarter of 2011 to $3,893 million versus $3,613 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase in total revenue in the second quarter of 2011 included a decline in other revenue due to certain milestone payments earned in the second quarter of 2010.
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.37 for the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of 1 percent compared to $1.38 for the second quarter of 2010. Adjusted net income decreased 3 percent to $1,281 million in the second quarter of 2011 compared to $1,326 million in the second quarter of 2010.
"Our products recorded a strong 8 percent growth during the quarter," said Kevin Sharer, chairman & CEO at Amgen. "Our business has momentum and we expect to be at the upper end of our revenue and EPS guidance ranges for the year."
AMGEN'S SECOND QUARTER 2011 REVENUE INCREASED 4 PERCENT
TO $4.0 BILLION; SECOND QUARTER 2011 ADJUSTED EPS WERE $1.37

Adjusted EPS and adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2011 and 2010 exclude, for the applicable periods stock option expense, certain expenses related to acquisitions and actions to improve cost efficiencies, non-cash interest expense resulting from a change in accounting for our convertible notes, and certain other items. These adjustments and other items are presented on the attached reconciliations.
On a reported basis in accordance with United States (U.S.) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amgen's GAAP diluted EPS were $1.25 in the second quarter of 2011, unchanged from the same quarter last year. GAAP net income of $1,170 million in the second quarter of 2011 decreased 3 percent from $1,202 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Product Sales Performance
Total product sales increased 8 percent to $3,893 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $3,613 million in the second quarter of 2010. U.S. product sales increased 7 percent to $2,975 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $2,787 million in the second quarter of 2010. International sales increased 11 percent to $918 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $826 million in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the $34 million favorable impact of foreign exchange in the second quarter of 2011, both total product sales and international product sales increased 7 percent.
Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) sales decreased 3 percent to $585 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $603 million in the second quarter of 2010. U.S. Aranesp sales decreased 10 percent to $241 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $267 million in the second quarter of 2010, due principally to a mid-teens percentage point decrease in unit demand, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. This sales decrease reflects an overall decline in the segment. International Aranesp sales increased 2 percent to $344 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $336 million in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the $10 million favorable impact of foreign exchange in the second quarter of 2011, international Aranesp sales decreased 1 percent due principally to a low single-digit percentage point decrease in the average net sales price, substantially offset by an increase in unit demand. This sales decrease reflects an overall decline in the segment, largely offset by an increase in share and expansion into newer territories.
EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa) sales decreased 17 percent to $543 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $657 million in the second quarter of 2010, due primarily to a decline in unit demand. The decrease in unit demand reflects a decrease in dose utilization due to implementation of the bundled payment system, offset slightly by patient population growth. The Company announced that it expects an additional decrease in dose utilization related to label changes and reimbursement changes proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, should the proposal be implemented as drafted. If implemented, in aggregate, the Company expects dose utilization would decline in 2011 as compared to 2010 by 20 to 25 percent, offset partially by patient population growth and an increase in the average net sales price. The Company believes that the majority of the dose utilization changes will be implemented by the end of 2011 with some residual impact early in 2012. The Company also believes that mean hemoglobin levels will remain above 10 g/dL in the dialysis setting.

TO $4.0 BILLION; SECOND QUARTER 2011 ADJUSTED EPS WERE $1.37

Combined Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim) sales increased 13 percent to $1,326 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $1,174 million in the second quarter of 2010. Combined U.S. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales increased 15 percent to $999 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $868 million in the second quarter of 2010, driven primarily by increases in unit demand and the average net sales price. Approximately half of the unit demand increase reflects underlying Neulasta demand growth including increased first cycle penetration due to uses of newer, more myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens. The remaining unit demand growth was primarily driven by the timing of customer orders. Combined international Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales increased 7 percent to $327 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $306 million in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding the $14 million favorable impact of foreign exchange, combined international Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales increased 2 percent reflecting growth in Neulasta due, in part, to continued conversion from NEUPOGEN to Neulasta.
Enbrel (etanercept) sales increased 9 percent to $956 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $877 million in the second quarter of 2010, driven primarily by increases in the average net sales price and unit demand. This sales increase reflects segment growth, offset partially by share declines. ENBREL remains the leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.
Sales of Sensipar / Mimpara (cinacalcet) increased 16 percent to $199 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $172 million in the second quarter of 2010. Sales of Vectibix (panitumumab) increased 13 percent to $81 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $72 million in the second quarter of 2010. Sales of Nplate (romiplostim) increased 36 percent to $75 million in the second quarter of 2011 versus $55 million in the second quarter of 2010. These increases were driven by increases in global demand.
Sales of Prolia (denosumab) in the second quarter of 2011 were $44 million, reflecting continued adoption by physicians and expanded access from payers in the U.S. and internationally.
U.S. sales of XGEVA (denosumab) were $73 million in the second full quarter following launch. Sales were driven by increased segment share as well as overall segment growth.

Operating Expense Analysis on an Adjusted Basis:
 
 
 
The adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 2011 was 15.2 percent compared to 20.0 percent for the second quarter of 2010. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of foreign tax credits associated with the new Puerto Rico excise tax effective in 2011 and the benefit of the federal R&D credit in the second quarter of 2011 that was not in effect for the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by the impact of the non-deductible U.S. Healthcare Reform Fee. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, the adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of 2011 would have been 20.3 percent.
Average diluted shares for adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2011 were 934 million versus 964 million for the second quarter of 2010.
Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2011 were $123 million versus $177 million in the second quarter of 2010. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2011 decreased to $1.5 billion versus $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Worldwide cash and marketable securities for the second quarter of 2011 were $19.2 billion and adjusted outstanding debt for the second quarter of 2011 was $14.2 billion, reflecting our $3.0 billion debt issuance in June 2011. The Company's adjusted outstanding debt excludes the impact of a change in accounting for the carrying values of its convertible debt. The Company repurchased 13 million shares of its stock during the second quarter of 2011 at a total cost of $732 million. As of June 30, 2011, the Company had $6.4 billion remaining under its authorized stock repurchase program.

Amgen Announced First Quarterly Cash Dividend
Amgen today announced that on July 28, 2011, its Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock, to be paid on the payment date of Sept. 8, 2011 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date of Aug. 18, 2011. This is the first quarterly dividend declared under the Board's dividend policy announced on April 21, 2011. Future dividends will be subject to Board approval.
2011 Guidance Update
The Company updated its total revenue guidance for 2011 to be at the upper end of the current guidance range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. Amgen now expects 2011 adjusted EPS to be at the upper end of the current guidance range of $5.00 to $5.20, excluding stock option expense, certain expenses related to acquisitions and actions to improve cost efficiencies, non-cash interest expense resulting from a change in accounting for convertible debt, and certain other items presented on the attached reconciliations.
The Company still expects the total impact of U.S. Healthcare Reform in 2011 to be in the range of $400 million to $500 million, including the federal excise fee which is still expected to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million.
With respect to other guidance, Amgen continues to expect the adjusted tax rate for 2011 to be in the range of 15 percent to 16 percent. This reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax.
The Company still expects 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million.
AMGEN'S SECOND QUARTER 2011 REVENUE INCREASED 4 PERCENT
TO $4.0 BILLION; SECOND QUARTER 2011 ADJUSTED EPS WERE $1.37

Prolia: The Company announced that a small Phase 3 Bone Mineral Density study in men with osteoporosis met all endpoints and the safety data were consistent with what has been previously reported in other populations.
XGEVA: The Company discussed the European Medicines Agency marketing authorization it received on July 15th for the prevention of skeletal-related events in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors.
The Company also discussed that it submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application on June 27th to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the indication for XGEVA to treat men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer to reduce the risk of developing bone metastases.
Vectibix: The Company discussed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) positive opinion it received in the European Union for use in combination with chemotherapy in first- and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with wild-type .
KRAS
The Company announced that it received Complete Response Letters from the FDA on the first- and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer supplemental Biologics License Applications. The FDA has requested additional information from the 181 and 203 pivotal trials. The letters do not require additional clinical trials. Amgen is reviewing the Complete Response Letters and will work with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps regarding these applications.
Nplate: The Company announced that the U.S. Prescribing Information for Nplate has been modified to heighten awareness that use is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to myelodysplastic syndrome. The Company also discussed the FDA's recent announcement that they are working to modify the Nplate Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to maintain a focus on physician understanding of appropriate use and potential risks, while eliminating the requirement for restricted distribution of Nplate. This will reduce the burden on physicians prescribing Nplate.
OncoVEX
GM-CSF
: The Company announced that its Phase 3 trial in patients with malignant melanoma is now fully enrolled.
The Company also announced its decision to terminate its current OncoVEX
GM-CSF
Phase 3 trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) to permit significant modification of clinical trial design mandated by the changing therapeutic landscape for patients with SCCHN.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management has presented its operating results in accordance with GAAP and on an "adjusted" (or non-GAAP) basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. In addition, management has presented its outstanding debt in accordance with GAAP and on an "adjusted" (or non-GAAP) basis as of June 30, 2011. The Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in conformity with GAAP. Further, our reconciliations of GAAP to "adjusted" operating results, which are included on the attached tables, are presented in the format of condensed consolidated statements of income solely to facilitate a reader's understanding of the impact of the various adjustments to our GAAP operating results, individually and in the aggregate, and are not intended to place any undue prominence on our adjusted operating results.
Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and others that can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010, and in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. The Company's results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments (domestic or foreign) involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products (domestic or foreign) and difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. In addition, sales of our products are affected by reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and health care cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We, or others, could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers.
