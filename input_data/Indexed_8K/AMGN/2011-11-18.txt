Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On November 15, 2011, Amgen USA Inc. ("Amgen USA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a seven-year Sourcing and Supply Agreement (the "Agreement") with DaVita Inc. ("DaVita") pursuant to which Amgen USA will supply, and DaVita will purchase, EPOGEN (Epoetin alfa) in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of DaVita's and its affiliates' requirements for erythropoiesis stimulating agents used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. The term of the Agreement commences January 1, 2012 and ends on December 31, 2018. The Agreement will replace the Dialysis Organization Agreement, effective January 1, 2011, between Amgen USA and DaVita that expires by its terms on December 31, 2011.
The Agreement, among other things, provides for discount pricing and rebates for EPOGEN. Some of the rebates are subject to various conditions including future pricing levels of EPOGEN by Amgen USA and data submission by DaVita. The Agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the Agreement by the other party.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
