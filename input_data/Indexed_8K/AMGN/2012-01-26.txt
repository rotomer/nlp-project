Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 26, 2012, Amgen Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and its unaudited financial position as of December 31, 2011. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to December 31, 2011 and for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
As of December 31, 2011
As of December 31, 2011, the Company reported a non-GAAP financial measure for total outstanding debt which excluded the impact of adopting a new accounting standard, on the carrying values of its convertible notes. The Company believes that excluding the impact of this accounting standard on its total outstanding debt provides a supplemental measure of financial condition that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after its convertible notes are outstanding.
Three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with:

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also include the tax effect of the adjustments in 2011, discussed below, excluding the 2011 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit (the 2011 Tax Effect).
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) (COS) expense, R&D expense, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options. COS expense was also adjusted to exclude the BI Fremont Transaction Expense. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization. SG&A expense was also adjusted to exclude the 2011 Business Combinations Costs. Weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share were adjusted to exclude the related effects of expensing stock options. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, COS expense was also adjusted to exclude the Bergamo Inventory Cost. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the 2011 Expense Reversal Due To Cost-Saving Initiatives and the BioVex Employee Stock Option Expense. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the BI Fremont Transaction Expense, the 2011 Business Combinations Costs and the 2011 Expense Reversal Due To Cost-Saving Initiatives provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the Bergamo Inventory Cost and the BioVex Employee Stock Option Expense provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP provisions for income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the related effects of expensing stock options on weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the reasons discussed above, the Product Technology Rights' Amortization, the 2011 Cost-Saving Initiatives Expense, the BioVex Contingent Consideration Costs, the 2011 Legal Expense, the Non-Cash Interest Expense and the 2011 Tax Effect and, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the 2011 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit. The Company believes that excluding the Product Technology Rights' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Cost-Saving Initiatives Expense, the BioVex Contingent Consideration Costs and the Non-Cash Interest Expense provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred.The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Legal Expense and the 2011 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company also reported a non-GAAP effective tax rate that excludes the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax. The Company believes that excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such item is incurred.

For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also relate to the benefit related to certain legal poceedings (the 2010 Legal Awards).
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures also include the tax effect of the adjustments in 2010, discussed below, excluding the 2010 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit and the 2010 Income Tax Benefit (the 2010 Tax Effect).
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share. COS expense, R&D expense and SG&A expense were adjusted to exclude the effects of expensing stock options. R&D expense was also adjusted to exclude the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization. Weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share were adjusted to exclude the related effects of expensing stock options. The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provisions for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable, the foregoing expense amounts and the related effects of expensing stock options on weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the reasons discussed above, the Product Technology Rights' Amortization, the Asset Impairment Charge, the Non-Cash Interest Expense, the 2010 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit, the 2010 Income Tax Benefit, the 2010 Tax Effect and, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, the 2010 Legal Awards. The Company believes that excluding the Product Technology Rights' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the Asset Impairment Charge, the 2010 Legal Awards, the 2010 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit and the 2010 Income Tax Benefit provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Non-Cash Interest Expense provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expense is incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2010 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a convenience to investors.

On a reported basis in accordance with United States (U.S.) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amgen's GAAP diluted EPS were $1.08 for the fourth quarter of 2011, unchanged from the same quarter last year. GAAP net income of $934 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 decreased 9 percent from $1,022 million in the same quarter last year.

For the full year 2011, GAAP net income decreased 20 percent to $3,683 million versus $4,627 million for the full year 2010. GAAP diluted EPS and net income for the full year 2011 were negatively impacted by a previously disclosed charge for a legal settlement.
Product Sales Performance
Total product sales increased 4 percent to $3,907 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $3,760 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. U.S. product sales increased 5 percent to $3,007 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $2,869 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. International product sales increased 1 percent to $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $891 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the $28 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in the fourth quarter of 2011, total product sales increased 5 percent and international product sales increased 4 percent. For the year, total product sales increased 4 percent to $15,295 million in 2011 versus $14,660 million in 2010. U.S. product sales increased 4 percent to $11,725 million in 2011 versus $11,254 million in 2010. International product sales increased 5 percent to $3,570 million in 2011 versus $3,406 million in 2010. Excluding the $33 million favorable impact of foreign exchange for the year 2011, total product sales and international product sales both increased 4 percent.
XGEVA (denosumab) sales were $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 31 percent over the third quarter, and $351 million for the full year 2011, reflecting increased segment share as well as overall segment growth.
Prolia (denosumab) sales were $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 59 percent over the third quarter, and $203 million for the full year 2011, reflecting significant growth globally.
Combined Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim) sales increased 7 percent to $1,319 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $1,237 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Combined U.S. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales increased 12 percent to $1,021 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $914 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily driven by an increase in the average net sales price, and to a lesser extent, favorable changes in wholesaler inventories. Combined Neulasta and NEUPOGEN international sales decreased 8 percent to $298 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the $10 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, international Neulasta and NEUPOGEN product sales decreased 5 percent primarily driven by a NEUPOGEN unit decline. For the year, combined Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales increased 8 percent to $5,212 million in 2011 versus $4,844 million in 2010, principally driven by an increase in the U.S. average net sales price and Neulasta unit growth.
Full Year 2011 Revenue Increased 4 Percent to $15.6 Billion and
Adjusted Earnings Per Share Increased 2 Percent to $5.33

Enbrel (etanercept) sales increased 1 percent to $945 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $939 million in the fourth quarter 2010, primarily driven by low single-digit percentage point unit growth, offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventories. For the year, ENBREL sales increased 5 percent to $3,701 million in 2011 versus $3,534 million in 2010, primarily driven by an increase in the average net sales price. ENBREL remains the segment share leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.
Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) sales decreased 15 percent to $538 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $633 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. U.S. Aranesp sales decreased 22 percent to $223 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $285 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, due principally to a unit decline, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price. The unit decline reflects segment contraction resulting from changes to the product label and reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. International Aranesp sales decreased 9 percent to $315 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $348 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the $12 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in the fourth quarter of 2011, international Aranesp sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to a unit decline reflecting segment contraction, while share remained stable. For the year, worldwide Aranesp sales decreased 7 percent to $2,303 million in 2011 versus $2,486 million in 2010, due principally to a high-teens percentage point unit decline in the U.S.
EPOGEN (epoetin alfa) sales decreased 18 percent to $486 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the year, EPOGEN sales decreased 19 percent to $2,040 million in 2011 versus $2,524 million in 2010. This was due to a decrease in dose utilization related to changes in reimbursement and the product label, offset partially by an increase in the average net sales price and patient population growth. Relative to the third quarter of 2011, fourth quarter EPOGEN sales increased 2 percent reflecting signs of dose stabilization.
Sales of our other, growth-phase products increased 16 percent to $1,427 million for the full year 2011 as compared to 2010. Sales of Sensipar/Mimpara (cinacalcet) increased 15 percent to $216 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $188 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales of Vectibix (panitumumab) increased 10 percent to $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales of Nplate (romiplostim) increased 23 percent to $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the year, Sensipar/Mimpara sales increased 13 percent to $808 million in 2011 versus $714 million in 2010, Vectibix sales increased 12 percent to $322 million versus $288 million in 2010, and Nplate sales increased 30 percent to $297 million versus $229 million in 2010. These increases were driven primarily by global unit growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Operating Expense Analysis on an Adjusted Basis:
 
Full Year 2011 Revenue Increased 4 Percent to $15.6 Billion and
Adjusted Earnings Per Share Increased 2 Percent to $5.33
Page 4
 
 
The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 was 14.3 percent compared with 15.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010. The decrease was due primarily to the recognition of foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. This decrease was offset partially by the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee and the full-year benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the enactment of the federal R&D credit. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, the adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 would have been 18.1 percent.
For 2011, the adjusted tax rate was 14.3 percent compared to 18.8 percent for 2010. The decrease in the full year adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the aforementioned foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax offset partially by the non-deductible U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee; excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, the adjusted tax rate for 2011 would have been 19.2 percent.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Amgen repurchased approximately 86 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $5.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2010, Amgen repurchased approximately 20 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $1.1 billion.
During 2011, Amgen repurchased approximately 144 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $8.3 billion and an average price of $57.55. During 2010, Amgen repurchased approximately 66 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $3.8 billion and an average price of $57.14. The Company currently has $5.0 billion remaining under its authorized stock repurchase program.
Full Year 2011 Revenue Increased 4 Percent to $15.6 Billion and
Adjusted Earnings Per Share Increased 2 Percent to $5.33

Average diluted shares for adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2011 were 860 million versus 946 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and 912 million for the full year 2011 versus 965 million for the full year 2010.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $241 million versus $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. For 2011, capital expenditures were $584 million versus $580 million in 2010. Operating cash flow for 2011 decreased 12 percent to approximately $5.1 billion versus approximately $5.8 billion in 2010 due primarily to increased interest expense and working capital increases related to the launches of Prolia and XGEVA. Worldwide cash and marketable securities were $20.6 billion and adjusted outstanding debt was $21.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2011.
2012 Guidance
The Company expects total revenue for 2012 to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion. Amgen expects 2012 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.15, excluding certain expenses related to acquisitions, the non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes, stock option expense and certain expenses related to a cost-saving initiative.
With respect to other guidance, Amgen expects the adjusted tax rate for 2012 to be in the range of 14 percent to 15 percent. This reflects the impact of the foreign tax credit associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Excluding the Puerto Rico excise tax, Amgen expects the adjusted tax rate for 2012 to be in the range of 19 percent to 20 percent.
The Company expects 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million.

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and others that can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010, and in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. The Company's results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments (domestic or foreign) involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products (domestic or foreign) and difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. In addition, sales of our products are affected by reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and health care cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We, or others, could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to successfully complete the acquisition of Micromet, Inc.
DOXIL is a registered trademark of Janssen Biotech Products, LP (formerly known as Centocor Ortho Biotech Products, LP).
