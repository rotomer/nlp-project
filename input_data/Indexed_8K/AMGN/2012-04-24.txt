Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 24, 2012, Amgen Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and its unaudited financial position as of March 31, 2012. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to March 31, 2012 and for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
As of March 31, 2012
As of March 31, 2012, the Company reported a non-GAAP financial measure for total outstanding debt which excluded the impact of bifurcating the debt and equity components of its convertible notes as required by U.S. accounting standards for these securities commencing in 2009. The Company believes that excluding this impact provides a supplemental measure of financial condition that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after its convertible notes are outstanding.
Three months ended March 31, 2012
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) (COS) expense, research and development (R&D) expense, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share:
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2012 BI Fremont Transaction Expense and the acquisition-related expenses provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company reported non-GAAP provision for income taxes, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share excluding, where applicable:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the Product Technology Rights' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the Cost-Savings Initiatives Expense and the Legal Expense provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Contingent Consideration Costs and the Non-Cash Interest Expense provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2012 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
Three months ended March 31, 2011
For the three months ended March 31, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share:
 
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 BI Fremont Transaction Expense and the acquisition-related expenses provide supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the R&D Technology Intangible Assets' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property.
For the three months ended March 31, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the Product Technology Rights' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the Cost-Savings Initiatives Expense and the 2011 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit provide supplemental measures that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Non-Cash Interest Expense provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expense is incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, as a convenience to investors.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(c) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (April 24, 2012)  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) reported total revenue increased 9 percent during the first quarter of 2012 to $4,048 million versus $3,706 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.61 for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 20 percent compared to $1.34 for the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted net income increased 2 percent to $1,287 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $1,258 million in the first quarter of 2011.
"We delivered strong sales and earnings during the first quarter, reflecting broad strength across the portfolio", said Kevin Sharer, chairman & CEO. "The pipeline is developing well and the business is in good shape to address the opportunities and challenges ahead," concluded Sharer.
Adjusted EPS and adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2012 and 2011 exclude, for the applicable periods, certain expenses related to acquisitions and cost-savings initiatives, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes and certain other items. These adjustments and other items are presented on the attached reconciliations.
On a reported basis in accordance with United States (U.S.) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Amgen's GAAP diluted EPS were $1.48 for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 23 percent compared to $1.20 for the first quarter of 2011. GAAP net income increased 5 percent to $1,184 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $1,125 million for the first quarter of 2011.

Product Sales Performance
Total product sales increased 8 percent to $3,901 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $3,618 million in the first quarter of 2011. U.S. product sales increased 8 percent to $2,997 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $2,778 million in the first quarter of 2011. International product sales increased 8 percent to $904 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $840 million in the first quarter of 2011. The impact of foreign exchange on international product sales for the first quarter of 2012 was not material.
XGEVA (denosumab) sales were $153 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 14 percent over the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting increased segment share as well as overall segment growth.
Prolia (denosumab) sales were $88 million in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 9 percent over the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting continued global growth.
Combined Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and NEUPOGEN (Filgrastim) sales increased 9 percent to $1,344 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $1,232 million in the first quarter of 2011. Combined U.S. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales increased 13 percent to $1,053 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $930 million in the first quarter of 2011, driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, an increase in Neulasta unit demand. Combined Neulasta and NEUPOGEN international sales decreased 4 percent to $291 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $302 million in the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price. A mid single-digit percentage point increase in Neulasta unit demand was offset by a decline in NEUPOGEN units due primarily to biosimilar competition.
Enbrel (etanercept) sales increased 7 percent to $938 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $875 million in the first quarter 2011, driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price. ENBREL remains the segment share leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments.
Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) sales decreased 11 percent to $518 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $580 million in the first quarter of 2011. U.S. Aranesp sales decreased 19 percent to $202 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $250 million in the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to a decline in unit demand, offset partially by a mid single-digit percentage point increase in the average net sales price. The unit decline reflects segment contraction resulting from changes to the product label and reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011. International Aranesp sales decreased 4 percent to $316 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $330 million in the first quarter of 2011, due primarily to a decrease in the average net sales price.
EPOGEN (epoetin alfa) sales decreased 17 percent to $446 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $535 million in the first quarter of 2011, reflecting the impact of changes to the label and reimbursement. The decline was comprised of an approximately 30 percent decrease in unit demand driven by a reduction in dose utilization, offset partially by reductions in customer discounts as part of new provider contracts that became effective Jan. 1, 2012.

On a sequential basis, EPOGEN sales decreased 8 percent, comprised of an approximately 20 percent decrease in unit demand driven by the timing of end-user purchases at the end of 2011 and a reduction in dose utilization. These decreases were offset partially by reductions in customer discounts as part of new provider contracts.
Sales of our other, growth-phase products increased 22 percent to $399 million in the first quarter 2012 versus $327 million in the first quarter of 2011. Sales of Sensipar/Mimpara (cinacalcet) increased 17 percent to $219 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $187 million in the first quarter of 2011. Sales of Vectibix (panitumumab) increased 20 percent to $90 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $75 million in the first quarter of 2011. Sales of Nplate (romiplostim) increased 38 percent to $90 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $65 million in the first quarter of 2011. These increases were driven primarily by global unit growth.
Operating Expense Analysis on an Adjusted Basis:
increased to 17.1 percent of sales in the first quarter of 2012 versus 14.9 percent of sales in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, cost of sales would have been 15.0 percent of sales for the first quarter of 2012 versus 14.6 percent of sales for the first quarter of 2011 driven primarily by higher inventory write-offs.
Cost of sales
expenses increased 3 percent to $723 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $703 million in the first quarter of 2011. The increase was due to higher costs associated with supporting our later stage clinical programs including AMG 145, AMG 785 and talimogene laherparepvec. This increase was offset partially by reduced expenses in Discovery Research and Translational Sciences.
Research & Development (R&D) 
expenses increased 5 percent to $1,057 million in the first quarter of 2012 versus $1,011 million in the first quarter of 2011. This increase was driven principally by higher spending on marketed products, related primarily to the launch of ENBREL and Prolia direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns as well as international expansion, and by increased ENBREL profit share expenses. These increases were offset partially by a favorable change to the estimated 2011 U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee.
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A)
The adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 was 15.6 percent compared with 16.6 percent for the first quarter of 2011. The decrease was due primarily to changes in revenue and expense mix, the aforementioned adjustment to the non-deductible healthcare reform federal excise fee, and additional foreign tax credits associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. This decrease was offset partially by the federal R&D credit benefit in the first quarter of 2011. As of March 31, 2012, the U.S. Congress had not extended the R&D tax credit that expired at the end of 2011. Excluding the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax, the adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of 2012 would have been 20.2 percent versus 20.9 percent in the first quarter of 2011.

During the first quarter of 2012, Amgen repurchased approximately 21 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $1.4 billion. The Company currently has $3.6 billion remaining under its authorized stock repurchase program.
The Company previously announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.36 per share dividend for the second quarter of 2012. The dividend will be paid on June 7, 2012, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2012.
Average diluted shares for adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2012 were 799 million versus 940 million for the first quarter of 2011.
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2012 were $129 million versus $100 million in the first quarter of 2011. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2012 was $1.0 billion, approximately the same as the first quarter of 2011. Worldwide cash and marketable securities were $19.4 billion and adjusted outstanding debt was $21.5 billion as of March 31, 2012.
2012 Guidance
The Company continues to expect 2012 total revenue to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion, and 2012 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.15, excluding certain expenses related to acquisitions and cost-savings initiatives, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes and certain other items.
With respect to other guidance, Amgen continues to expect the adjusted tax rate for 2012 to be in the range of 14 percent to 15 percent. Excluding the Puerto Rico excise tax, Amgen still expects the adjusted tax rate for 2012 to be in the range of 19 percent to 20 percent.
The Company still expects 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million.

successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments (domestic or foreign) involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products (domestic or foreign) and difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. In addition, sales of our products are affected by reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and health care cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We, or others, could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.
