The Notes were sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States.

Net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately 669 million for the 2019 Notes and 685 million for the 2029 Notes, in each case after deducting managers' discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
The relevant terms of the Notes are set forth in the Indenture, included as Exhibit 4.1 of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-107639), filed on August 4, 2003, and incorporated herein by reference, and the Officers' Certificate (including forms of the Notes) attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a change in control triggering event as defined in the Officers' Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The descriptions of the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes in this report are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes, respectively.
The Notes will rank equal in right of payment to all of the Company's other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, senior in right of payment to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated indebtedness, effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Company's subsidiaries' obligations (including secured and unsecured obligations) and subordinated in right of payment to the Company's secured obligations, to the extent of the assets securing such obligations.
