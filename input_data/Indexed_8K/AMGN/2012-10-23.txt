Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On October 23, 2012, Amgen Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing its unaudited results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and its unaudited financial position as of September 30, 2012. The full text of the press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto.
In its press release the Company included certain historical non-U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) financial measures as defined in Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to September 30, 2012 and 2011 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. Reconciliations for such historical non-GAAP financial measures are attached to the press release set forth as Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto. The Company believes that its presentation of historical non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. These historical non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
As of September 30, 2012
As of September 30, 2012, the Company reported a non-GAAP financial measure for total outstanding debt which excluded the impact of bifurcating the debt and equity components of its convertible notes as required by U.S. accounting standards for these securities commencing in 2009. The Company believes that excluding this impact provides a supplemental measure of financial condition that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after its convertible notes are outstanding.
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2012
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for cost of sales (excludes amortization of certain acquired intangible assets) (COS) expense, research and development (R&D) expense, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share:
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2012 BI Transaction Expense, the acquisition-related expenses and the 2012 R&D Cost-Savings Initiatives Expense provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the Product Technology Rights' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2012 Cost-Savings Initiatives Expense and the 2012 Legal Expense provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the 2012 Acquisition-related Asset Write-off, the Contingent Consideration Costs and the Non-Cash Interest Expense provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2012 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
As of September 30, 2011
As of September 30, 2011, the Company reported a non-GAAP financial measure for total outstanding debt which excluded the impact of bifurcating the debt and equity components of its convertible notes as required by U.S. accounting standards for these securities commencing in 2009. The Company believes that excluding this impact provides a supplemental measure of financial condition that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after its convertible notes are outstanding.
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2011
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Company's adjustments to GAAP financial measures relate to amounts associated with:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP financial results for COS expense, R&D expense, SG&A expense, and weighted average shares used in the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share:
 
 
 
 
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, COS expense was also adjusted to exclude the acquisition-related expenses.
The Company believes that excluding the impact of expensing stock options and the related effects of expensing stock options provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods before and during when such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 BI Transaction Expense, the acquisition-related expenses and the 2011 Expense Reversal Due To Cost Savings Initiatives provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred.
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Company reported non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding, where applicable:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company believes that excluding the Product Technology Rights' Amortization treats those assets as if the Company had developed them internally in the past, and thus provides a supplemental measure of profitability in which the Company's acquired intellectual property is treated in a comparable manner to its internally developed intellectual property. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Cost-Savings Initiatives Expense, the 2011 Legal Expense and the 2011 Prior Period Charges Tax Benefit provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons between periods in which such items did not occur. The Company believes that excluding the Contingent Consideration Costs and the Non-Cash Interest Expense provides supplemental measures of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after such expenses are incurred. The Company believes that excluding the 2011 Tax Effect provides a supplemental measure of profitability that will facilitate comparisons before, during and after the related adjustments have occurred.
For the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2012, the Company reported Free Cash Flow (FCF) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations, each as determined in accordance with GAAP and as reflected in the statement of cash flows. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company uses this measure internally and believes that providing FCF to investors facilitates additional analysis.
The Company uses the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning.
Due to the differing treatments of expensing stock options for the purpose of presenting adjusted earnings per share within and across industries, the Company also reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share including the impact of expensing stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, as a convenience to investors.

This news release contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and others that can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, and in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. The Company's results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments (domestic or foreign) involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products (domestic or foreign) and difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. In addition, sales of our products are affected by reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and health care cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We, or others, could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be

impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.
