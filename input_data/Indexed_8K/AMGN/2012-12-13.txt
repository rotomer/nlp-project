Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 13, 2012, the Compensation and Management Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Amgen Inc. (the "Company") approved awards of performance units ("performance units") and established the performance goals with respect to the performance units awarded for the 2013-2015 three-year performance period (the "2013-2015 Performance Period") under the Amgen Inc. 2009 Performance Award Program (the "Performance Program"). The 2013-2015 Performance Period will begin on the third business day after the release of the Company's 2012 fourth quarter earnings (which release is expected to occur on January 23, 2013 and the grant date accordingly would be on January 28, 2013 (the "Grant Date")).
The number of shares of Company common stock, par value $.0001 per share ("Common Stock"), earned under the performance goals for the 2013-2015 Performance Period will be based on the percentile rank of the Company's three-year total shareholder return ("TSR") as compared to the percentile rank of the three-year TSR of the companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index as of the Grant Date (the "Reference Group"). The determination of the number of performance units earned for the 2013-2015 Performance Period will be based on the number of performance units granted multiplied by the "Relative Total Shareholder Return Percentage" as summarized below:
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the Committee approved an amendment to the Performance Program to allow the Committee to approve performance goals and awards before the start of the relevant performance period, rather than within the first 90 days of such period.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
