An investment in money market funds is not  insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
Stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies involve substantial risk. Historically, these stocks have experienced greater price volatility than stocks of larger companies, and they can be expected to do so in the future. Stocks of mid-capitalization may be slightly less volatile than those of small-capitalization companies but still involve substantial risk.
 
The investment process used to manage the AXP Quantitative Large Cap Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may underperform its benchmark.  While Ameriprise Financial, Inc. seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often that other funds in its peer group.  Trading activity may result in inceased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
The AXP Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The AXP Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
The AXP Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.
 
High-yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the AXP Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the AXP U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
Principal risks associated with the AXP Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
