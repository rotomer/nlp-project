Item 2.02
              
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 24, 2005, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing, among other things, its financial results for the third quarter of 2005.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.  In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Quarterly Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2005.
 
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 includes references to "adjusted earnings," "adjusted revenues" and "adjusted expenses" and related per diluted share data and other related "adjusted" financial measures, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  These adjusted financial measures exclude accounting changes, discontinued operations, the operations of AMEX Assurance and non-recurring costs related to the Company's separation from American Express Company ("AXP").  T he press release also includes references to "total expenses before separation costs" and "income tax provision before tax benefits attributable to separation costs," which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of non-recurring costs related to the Company's separation from AXP.  The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are more indicative of the Company's operating performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
 
Item 8.01
              
Other Events.
 
On October 24, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing, among other things, that it entered into a Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Settlement Terms regarding the settlement of a class action lawsuit.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and the information under the heading "Settlement of Class Action Lawsuit" of such press release is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.
 
The Company, formerly the subsidiary of AXP known as American Express Financial Corporation, along with various other affiliated defendants listed below, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Settlement Terms ("MOU") to settle the pending consolidated securities class action lawsuit styled In re American Express Financial Advisors Securities Litigation, Master Docket No.1: 04-CV-1773 (S.D.N.Y.).  As previously disclosed in the Company's Registration Statement on Form 10 and Information Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, defendants in the action are the Company, the Company's subsidiary Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. (formerly named American Express Financial Advisors Inc. ("AFSI"), our former parent corporation American Express Company and James Cracchiolo as CEO of the Company and AFSI  (collectively, the "Defendants").  The amended complaint also identifies various proprietary mutual funds, known as American Express or AXP brand mutual funds (the "AXP Funds"), as nominal defendants (the AXP Funds and the funds of its successor brand RiverSource will be referred to collectively as the "Nominal Defendants").  The amended complaint in this litigation alleged that the Defendants fraudulently or otherwise improperly (1) sold mutual funds as part of a program or practice where revenue sharing and/or directed brokerage was paid to any of the Defendants, (2) sold AXP Funds, and (3) sold financial plans to members of the purported class during the alleged class period.  The class period covered by the MOU is March 10, 1999 through and including the date of the stipulation of settlement (the "Class Period").  The Defendants have denied any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the claims raised in the litigation. Under the terms of the MOU, the named plaintiffs, the Defendants, and the Nominal Defendants agree that the final stipulation will contain a disclaimer of liability or wrongdoing, consistent with the MOU.
SM
 
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, the Company on behalf of all Defendants will pay into escrow for the benefit of the class members $100 million (the "Settlement Fund") within
10 business days of preliminary approval of the settlement by the court.  Reasonable attorneys' fees will be paid out of the Settlement Fund.  In exchange for the Settlement Fund, the Defendants and the Nominal Defendants shall be granted a release and discharge of all claims in the Complaint and any other claims or causes of action that are or could have been alleged or asserted with respect to conduct giving rise to any or all of those claims for the Class Period, including, but not limited to, claims or causes of action during the Class Period relating to: (1) receipt or payment of revenue sharing and/or directed brokerage; (2) the purchase or sale of proprietary mutual funds, including AXP Funds; (3) the purchase or sale of mutual funds that are part of the Select Group Program, the Preferred Provider Program, and/or any other program or practice where revenue sharing and/or directed brokerage was paid to any of the Defendants; (4) fees paid for financial plans; and (5) the rendering of financial advice where the person has paid a fee for advice, including but not limited to advice rendered in financial plans; and (6) the recommending by AEFA of products or investments, where the person has paid a fee for advice, including but not limited to recommendations made in financial plans.   The broad scope of this release will allow the Company to go forward under its new brand with the contingent liability represented by the In re AEFA class action behind it.
 
 The MOU, Stipulation of Settlement and Settlement Agreement are contingent upon the satisfaction of various conditions, including, but not limited to, preliminary approval by the court and final approval by the court after notice to the class and a hearing.  There can be no assurance that the Settlement Agreement will be approved by the Court or upheld if challenged on appeal.
 
As of September 30, 2005 the Company had accrued a reserve that is sufficient to cover the contingent liability for the settlement.  The reserve for this litigation was increased by $70 million pretax, $46 million after-tax, at September 30, 2005 from the reserve at June 30, 2005. The impact of this reserve increase is reflected on the Company's consolidated income statements for the periods ended September 30, 2005.  While AXP is a signatory to the MOU, the Company bears the entire cost of the settlement.

News Release
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income before discontinued operations of $123 million for the third quarter, down 35 percent from $188 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings  net income excluding discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs  increased 11 percent, to $179 million in 2005 from $161 million in the 2004 quarter. Net income before discontinued operations per diluted share for the third quarter of 2005 was $0.50. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter 2005 were $0.73, up 11 percent from the comparable period last year.
Minneapolis  October 24, 2005 
 
Included in both net income and adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2005 is a $70 million expense, $46 million after-tax, related to the comprehensive settlement of the consolidated securities class action lawsuit discussed later in this release. Also included in the quarter is an after-tax benefit of $44 million from the annual Deferred Acquisition Cost (DAC) assessment, $13 million in tax expenses related to the finalization of prior period tax returns and $4 million in after-tax realized net investment losses. Included in third quarter 2004 were $22 million in after-tax regulatory and legal costs, an after-tax benefit of $15 million from the annual DAC assessment and $7 million in after-tax realized net investment gains.
 
Revenues grew 9 percent to $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2005 from $1.7 billion in the same period of 2004. Adjusted revenues  revenues excluding discontinued operations and AMEX Assurance  grew 15 percent, predominantly driven by 25 percent growth in management, financial advice and service fees and 19 percent growth in distribution fees for the same period.
 
Return on equity  calculated using net income before discontinued operations, which includes separation costs, and equity excluding both the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  for the 12 months ended September 30, 2005 was 9.8 percent.
 
"Our results for the third quarter were strong, reflecting continued success in our strategies to increase financial plan penetration, target mass affluent clients and improve advisor productivity. We have succeeded in enhancing our operating performance while successfully executing a substantial number of tasks to separate from American Express," said Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"In addition to generating improved operating performance, we rebranded our company to Ameriprise Financial, established the RiverSource brand for our products, launched a new advertising campaign and completed the legal separation from American Express through a stock dividend paid on September 30," added Cracchiolo.
Management believes that the presentation of "adjusted" financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of the company's ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude accounting change, discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs. This presentation aligns with the pro forma financials contained in our Form 10, which was filed August 19, 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Key Operating Highlights
 
Total clients increased 2 percent from a year ago to 2.8 million, with client retention remaining strong at 94 percent. The number of mass affluent clients increased 12 percent from the year ago period. Clients with a financial plan increased to 43 percent of our branded advisor client base, up from 42 percent in the year ago period. The company sold approximately 54,500 financial plans in the third quarter of 2005, up 7 percent from the comparable year ago period.
 
Advisor productivity showed continued improvement, with branded advisor cash sales up 14 percent, retail managed assets up 13 percent and Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) up 17 percent.
 
Total advisors grew 1 percent to 12,188 from 12,071 at the end of the prior year quarter. Branded advisors of 10,480 decreased less than 1 percent from a year ago due to fewer employee advisor appointments during the second and third quarters. Advisor annualized retention was 91 percent for franchisees and 64 percent for employees.
 
At September 30, 2005, owned, managed and administered assets increased 11 percent from September 30, 2004, or $42 billion, to over $420 billion. The growth was driven by increases of $14 billion in SPS wrap assets, $13 billion in higher Threadneedle managed assets and $9 billion in higher owned assets. During the quarter, the company transferred its 50 percent ownership interest in American Express International Deposit Company (AEIDC) to American Express. All periods have been restated to remove AEIDC assets from the owned category and to report the related investment portfolio in the managed category. During the third quarter, the company received a $1.1 billion capital contribution from American Express. The impact on assets due to the AMEX Assurance transaction was immaterial.

Third Quarter 2005 Consolidated Results
 
Consolidated revenues rose 9 percent to $1.9 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the year ago quarter. Adjusted revenues, which exclude AMEX Assurance-related revenues, grew 15 percent.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 25 percent to $687 million, driven by higher assets under management, including the impact of market appreciation, Threadneedle hedge fund performance fees and greater SPS wrap fees. The impact of changes attributable to AMEX Assurance was immaterial.
 - 
                 
 
Distribution fees grew 19 percent to $296 million, as a result of an increase in fees from retail brokerage activity driven by stronger sales.
 - 
                 
Net investment income grew 8 percent to $561 million, driven by higher asset levels. Included in net investment income are the $6 million in net investment losses, which compared to $11 million of net investment gains from the third quarter of 2004. The impact of changes attributable to AMEX Assurance was immaterial.
 - 
                 
 
Premiums declined 23 percent to $202 million primarily due to the ceding of the AMEX Assurance business to American Express. Third quarter 2004 revenues included $62 million of premiums related to AMEX Assurance and third quarter 2005 revenues included $(15) million of premiums related to AMEX Assurance. Excluding AMEX Assurance, adjusted premiums increased 9 percent to $217 million due to growth in our home and auto insurance sales, most notably from the Costco alliance.
 - 
                 
 
Consolidated expenses totaled $1.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2005, up 17 percent from $1.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2004. This increase includes $92 million in non-recurring separation costs. Adjusted expenses, excluding separation costs and expenses associated with AMEX Assurance, were $1.6 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago.
 
Compensation and benefits  field increased 31 percent to $408 million and includes a significant impact related to AMEX Assurance of $35 million. Adjusted for AMEX Assurance, compensation and benefits  field increased 20 percent due to higher sales and related commissions.
 - 
                 
 
Compensation and benefits  non-field increased 19 percent to $295 million due to increased management incentives, higher benefit costs and merit adjustments. Increased management incentives were largely due to strong hedge fund performance at Threadneedle. The impact of changes attributable to AMEX Assurance was immaterial.
 - 
                 
 
Interest credited to account values increased 11 percent to $337 million due to higher interest crediting rates and volume growth on investment certificates products.
 - 
                 
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlements declined 8 percent to $190 million, reflecting a $60 million decline from the impact of ceding of AMEX Assurance reserves, which was offset by increases driven by higher life and health in-force levels and higher average home and auto insurance policies in force. On an adjusted basis, benefits, claims, losses and settlements increased 22 percent to $241 million.
 - 
                 
 
Amortization of DAC declined 55 percent to $49 million primarily as a result of a $67 million pretax benefit resulting from the annual DAC assessment. This compared to a $24 million pretax DAC amortization benefit in the third quarter 2004. On an adjusted basis, amortization of DAC declined 51 percent to $49 million.
 - 
                 
 
As disclosed in prior periods, Ameriprise annually performs a comprehensive review in the third quarter of each year and updates various DAC assumptions, such as persistency, mortality rate, interest margin and maintenance expense level assumptions. The impact on results from operations of changing assumptions with respect to the amortization of DAC can be either positive or negative in any particular period. As a result of these reviews, Ameriprise took actions in 2005 and 2004 that impacted the DAC balances and expenses.
 
In the third quarter of 2005, this comprehensive review resulted in a net $67 million DAC amortization expense reduction. Protection segment DAC amortization expense was reduced by $53 million and Asset Accumulation and Income segment DAC amortization expense was reduced by $14 million. These actions primarily reflected:
a $32 million DAC amortization reduction reflecting changes in previously assumed mortality rates; and
 - 
                 
a $33 million DAC amortization reduction reflecting lower than previously assumed surrender rates and higher associated surrender charges.
 - 
                 
Interest and debt expense increased 27 percent to $16 million reflecting higher short-term interest rates.
 - 
                 
 
Other expense increased 16 percent to $305 million including the previously mentioned $70 million pretax charge related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit. Adjusted for the impact of AMEX Assurance, other expense increased 20 percent to $304 million in the third quarter 2005.
 - 
                 
 
Separation costs incurred during the quarter of $92 million pretax ($59 million after-tax) were primarily related to advisor retention program costs, technology costs and costs associated with establishing the Ameriprise Financial brand. To date we have incurred $168 million pretax ($109 million after-tax) of the separation costs.

Pretax return on allocated equity for continuing operations was 17.6 percent at September 30, 2005, down 70 basis points from full year 2004.
 
Total revenues of $1.3 billion rose 16 percent from $1.1 billion in the year ago quarter.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 26 percent to $611 million, driven by net inflows into our wrap accounts, separate account assets and Threadneedle mutual funds, as well as market appreciation.
 - 
                 
 
Distribution fees grew 17 percent to $207 million, on an increase in fees from retail brokerage activity driven by stronger sales.
 - 
                 
Net investment income grew 7 percent to $479 million, driven by higher average invested assets, offset by net realized investment losses of $8 million. The average yield on invested assets was the same in both periods.
 - 
                 
 
Total expenses of $1.1 billion rose 17 percent from $971 million in the year ago quarter.

 -

 -

 -

 - 
                 
 
Other operating expenses increased 32 percent to $505 million on higher non-field compensation and benefits attributable to this segment, as well as the $70 million expense related to the settlement of the class action lawsuit.
 - 
                 
 
Asset management product revenues increased 12 percent compared to the year ago quarter, driven by increases in managed assets. At September 30, 2005, managed assets grew 9 percent as compared to September 30, 2004, reflecting market appreciation, which was partially offset by net outflows. In retail managed assets, we continued to experience negative flows in RiverSource mutual funds, offset by positive flows in Threadneedle mutual funds and wrap accounts. Institutional managed assets experienced negative flows primarily driven by our previously announced closing of several hedge funds and the San Diego office.
 
Variable annuity product revenues grew 11 percent compared to the year ago quarter, driven primarily by strong new flows. Variable annuity assets accounted for in owned assets continued to show strong increases with net flows of $826 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
Fixed annuity product revenues grew 2 percent compared to the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of realized gains and mark-to-market benefits on hedges.
 
Certificate product revenues rose 15 percent compared to the year ago quarter, due to increases in account values. Certificate revenues exclude AEIDC, which are now reported in discontinued operations.
 
Banking, brokerage and other product revenues increased 44 percent compared to the year ago quarter, due to strong sales and growth in the SPS wrap product, as well as higher financial advice and service fees.

Balance Sheet and Capital
 
Shareholders' equity was $7.8 billion up 17 percent from year-end 2004. The change reflects the capital contribution from American Express of $1.1 billion, a decline in other comprehensive income of $400 million, primarily driven by interest rate increases. Book value per share was $31.83. The debt/capital ratio declined from 19.7 percent at December 31, 2004 to 15.2 percent at September 30, 2005.
 
The company maintains substantial liquidity, with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2005. The company's investment portfolio quality remains high, with 49 percent of available for sale bonds rated double-A or higher and below investment grade bonds at 7 percent.  Reserve coverage of non-performing assets increased to 8.8 times at September 30, 2005 from 6.6 times at June 30, 2005.
 
which was drawn on September 28, 2005 to repay American Express for inter-company loans, and for other corporate purposes.
The company has filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in anticipation of issuing long-term senior debt of approximately $1.5 billion to replace the existing bridge loan,
 
The registration statement relating to the long-term senior debt securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any State in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such State.
 
Settlement of Class Action Lawsuit
 
Ameriprise Financial has reached a comprehensive settlement regarding the consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed against the company, its former parent and affiliates in October 2004 called, "In re
< p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;">
American Express Financial Advisors Securities Litigation." The settlement, under which the company denies any liability, includes a one-time payment of $100 million to the class members. The settlement is subject to court approval.
 
The class members include individuals who purchased mutual funds in the company's Preferred Provider Program, Select Group Program, or any similar revenue sharing program; purchased mutual funds sold under the American Express or AXP brand; or purchased for a fee financial plans or advice from the company between March 10, 1999 and through the date on which a formal stipulation of settlement is signed.
 
The company's litigation reserve is sufficient to cover the contingent liability for the settlement. The reserve for this litigation was increased by $70 million pretax, $46 million after-tax, at September 30, 2005 from the reserve at June 30, 2005. The impact of this reserve increase is reflected as an expense on the company's statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
While the company denies the allegations in this lawsuit, the company made the determination to settle this litigation and obtain the broad release from these claims so that it can move forward as a newly independent company unencumbered by the distraction, expense and uncertainty that accompanies such litigation. The company believes doing so is in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and its clients.
