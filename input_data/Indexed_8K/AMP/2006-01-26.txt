Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
                                            
 
On January 26, 2006, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2005.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.  In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Quarterly Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period and full year ended December 31, 2005.
 
The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 includes references to "adjusted earnings," "adjusted revenues" and "adjusted expenses" and related per diluted share data and other related "adjusted" financial measures, which are non-GAAP financial measures.  These adjusted financial measures exclude the cumulative effect of accounting changes, discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring costs related to the Company's separation from American Express Company ("AXP").  The press release also includes references to certain financial measures "before separation costs" and "before tax benefit attributable to separation costs" and "separation costs, after-tax," which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of non-recurring costs and associated tax benefits related to the Company's separation from AXP.  The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are more indicative of the Company's operating performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

(NYSE: AMP) today reported income before discontinued operations of $111 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2005 versus $226 million for the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily the result of $82 million in after-tax non-recurring separation costs and the inclusion of $24 million of AMEX Assurance after-tax earnings in the 2004 period.
MINNEAPOLIS
 
Adjusted earnings  net income excluding discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs  decreased 4 percent to $193 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, due to a lower income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2004.

Revenues grew 1 percent to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 from $1.8 billion in the same period of 2004.

Fourth Quarter 2005 Consolidated Results
 
Consolidated revenues rose 1 percent and adjusted revenues rose 5 percent to $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005. This compares to consolidated revenues and adjusted revenues of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 7 percent to $651 million from the year-ago quarter, as a result of higher asset values, which drove higher wrap account fees, RiverSource separate account fees and Threadneedle fees. These were partially offset by the impact of lower RiverSource mutual fund assets, primarily as a result of net outflows.
 - 
                 
 
Distribution fees grew 4 percent to $277 million, primarily as a result of strong flows into wrap accounts. The increase was partially offset by declines in fees from Real Estate Investment Trust products and lower distribution fees on RiverSource mutual fund sales.
 - 
                 
 
Net investment income grew 1 percent to $574 million, driven by an increase in invested assets. Results reflect a decline of $19 million due to the impact of lower appreciation in 2005 versus 2004 in the S&P 500 on the value of options hedging outstanding stock market certificates and equity indexed annuities, which was offset in the interest credited to the related accounts, as well as a market-driven decline of $9 million related to the Company's investment in hedge funds.
 - 
                 
 
Premiums declined 13 percent to $228 million due to the impact of AMEX Assurance. Adjusted premiums increased 12 percent, driven by increases in auto and home insurance sales, most notably from the Costco alliance, and growth in term life and disability insurance premiums.
 - 
                 
 
Consolidated expenses totaled $1.7 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2005, up 10 percent from the three months ended December 31, 2004. This increase includes $125 million in non-recurring separation costs. Adjusted expenses, excluding separation costs and expenses associated with AMEX Assurance, were $1.6 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago.
 
Compensation and benefits  field increased 10 percent to $374 million due to higher commissions paid, driven by strong sales activity and higher wrap account assets.
 - 
                 
 
Compensation and benefits  non-field increased 8 percent to $281 million, primarily due to increased management incentives, as well as salary and benefit expense increases.
 - 
                 
 
Interest credited to account values decreased 2 percent to $334 million, primarily due to declines in fixed annuity account balances and the impact of lower appreciation in 2005 versus 2004 in the S&P 500 on the interest credited to stock market certificates. These declines are the result of the strategic initiatives to deemphasize these products.
 - 
                 
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 5 percent to $234 million. Adjusted, these expenses increased 10 percent due to higher average auto and home insurance policies in force.
 - 
                 
Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) declined 9 percent to $112 million. On an adjusted basis, amortization of DAC declined 3 percent due to a decline in amortization related to RiverSource mutual funds.
 - 
                 
 
Interest and debt expense increased 36 percent to $21 million reflecting the replacement of debt, a substantial portion of which bore lower, variable interest rates, with $1.5 billion of five- and ten-year fixed-rate senior notes.
 - 
                 
 
Other expenses decreased 6 percent to $261 million. Adjusted other expenses declined 4 percent due to expense management initiatives and lower legal costs, partially offset by higher professional service fees and occupancy and equipment costs.
 - 
                 
 
Separation costs incurred during the quarter of $125 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) were primarily related to advisor retention program costs, technology costs and costs associated with establishing the Ameriprise Financial brand. To date, these separation costs have totaled $293 million pre-tax ($191 million after-tax).
 - 
                 
 
As part of the Company's efforts to improve its transparency, the product revenue mapping process was automated within the Company's segment reporting structure. Excluding the effects of automating this process, the Asset Accumulation and Income segment would have reported fourth quarter 2005 pre-tax income of $176 million, $13 million higher than reported, and the Corporate and Other and Eliminations segment would have reported fourth quarter 2005 pre-tax income of $20 million, $13 million lower than reported. This process change had no effect on fourth quarter 2005 consolidated or full year 2005 results.

Balance Sheet and Capital
 
Year-end 2005 shareholders' equity was $7.7 billion, up $1 billion or 16 percent from year-end 2004. The change reflects the capital contribution from American Express of $1.1 billion and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $469 million, primarily driven by the impact of interest rate increases on unrealized securities gains and losses. Year-end book value per share was $31.01. The year-end debt/capital ratio was 16.7 percent, down from 19.7 percent at year-end 2004.

The Company's investment portfolio quality remains high, with 51 percent of fixed income securities rated double-A or higher, up from 45 percent at year-end 2004, and below investment grade bonds at 7 percent, down from 8 percent at year-end 2004.
 
On November 23, 2005, the Company issued $1.5 billion of senior unsecured debt. The debt replaced bridge loan financing and provided capital for other corporate purposes. The bridge loan had replaced an inter-company loan from American Express. The coupon interest rates on the new debt are 5.35 percent on $800 million of five-year notes and 5.65 percent on $700 million of 10-year notes.

Source of Data: Lipper
 
Lipper rankings are based upon annualized total returns, excluding sales charges. Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date. When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP": the point of purchase return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge. Sales charges vary depending on the amount of your purchase. For more information regarding sales charges, please refer to the fund's prospectus. RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes. Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total. Please see page 11 to find total RiverSource Fund assets as of the quarter end.

The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies involve substantial risk. Historically, these stocks have experienced greater price volatility than stocks of larger companies, and they can be expected to do so in the future.
 
Stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be slightly less volatile than those of small-capitalization companies but still involve substantial risk.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may underperform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
