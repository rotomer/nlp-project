Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
                                            
 
On April 25, 2006, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2006.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.  In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. The non-GAAP presentation excludes items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, non-recurring separation costs and AMEX Assurance Company ("AMEX Assurance"). Our non-GAAP financial measures, which we view as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs; Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs); adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before discontinued operations and separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.

First Quarter 2006 Consolidated Results
 
Consolidated revenues rose 6 percent and adjusted revenues rose 10 percent to $1.9 billion for the first quarter of 2006. The Asset Accumulation and Income (AA&I) segment contributed 73 percent of the quarter's consolidated revenues. The Protection segment contributed 24 percent of the consolidated revenues, while the Corporate and Other and Eliminations (Corporate) segment contributed 3 percent, reflecting financial planning fees.
 
AA&I segment revenues of $1,422 million grew 9 percent or $123 million from the year-ago quarter. Growth was primarily driven by an 18 percent increase in management, financial advice and service fees resulting from strong net flows into wrap products and variable annuities, as well as market appreciation. On a product level, Brokerage, banking and other revenue grew 27 percent to $453 million, up $97 million, primarily due to increases in wrap account values; Variable annuity revenues grew 7 percent to $229 million, up $14 million; and Asset management, Fixed annuity and Certificate revenues rose 2 percent, with reported revenues of $740 million, which represented 52 percent of the segment's first quarter 2006 revenues.
 
Protection segment revenues of $473 million were up 9 percent or $39 million, after adjusting for AMEX Assurance. Growth was primarily the result of an 11 percent increase in premiums and an 11 percent increase in net investment income due to increased assets and capital supporting Auto and home and Variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) and higher income from hedge fund investments. On a product level, Auto and home revenues grew 18 percent, up $22 million, due to increased premium revenues and higher net investment income; Disability income and long term care and other revenues grew 8 percent or $9 million, reflecting both higher net investment income and higher premiums; and VUL/UL revenues were up 5 percent or $8 million, primarily driven by higher face amount in-force.
 
Consolidated expenses totaled $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2006.  Adjusted expenses were $1.7 billion, up 9 percent or $144 million, from a year ago. Growth was primarily driven by a $62 million increase in field compensation and benefits and a $41 million increase in other expense lines directly associated with business activities. Increases in non-field compensation and benefits of $37 million reflected higher costs associated with being an independent company, $11 million in severance incurred during the quarter and other costs. These increases were partially offset by lower legal and regulatory costs. Overall, expenses for the quarter were prudently managed.
 
Non-recurring separation costs incurred during the quarter of $67 million pre-tax ($44 million after-tax) compares to $20 million pre-tax ($13 million after-tax) in the first quarter of 2005. Through quarter end these costs totaled $360 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax).
 
Consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter was $191 million. Adjusted pre-tax income of $258 million was up 14 percent or $32 million, primarily due to a $54 million increase in the AA&I segment offset by increased losses in the Corporate segment.
 
AA&I segment pre-tax income of $228 million was up 31 percent or $54 million, driven by strong flows into wrap products and variable annuities, as well as a $24 million decrease in pre-tax legal and regulatory costs. The contribution margin in the segment declined from 54.8 percent to 53.7 percent, primarily due to certificate spread compression.
 
Protection segment pre-tax income of $74 million increased 1 percent after adjusting for AMEX Assurance. This growth reflected adjusted revenue growth of 9 percent primarily driven by higher auto and home insurance and life insurance revenues, offset by higher claims in disability
income insurance and long term care insurance, as well as an increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC).
 
The Corporate segment reported a pre-tax loss, before separation costs, of $44 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $21 million in the year-ago period. The increase of $23 million included $11 million in severance costs incurred during the quarter primarily related to our technology operations.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
of up to $750 million for the repurchase of Ameriprise Financial common stock through the end of March 2008. This $750 million authorization is in addition to a previous board authorization to repurchase up to 2 million shares by the end of 2006. The Company also completed a $275 million share repurchase from these authorizations representing 6.4 million shares. The repurchase of shares was funded from working capital. The Company intends to fund additional share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods.
As noted, the Ameriprise Financial Board of Directors authorized the expenditure
 
Shareholders' equity as of first quarter 2006 was $7.3 billion, up $0.9 billion or 13 percent from March 31, 2005. The change reflects additional paid-in capital of $1.3 billion and a $0.3 billion increase in retained earnings after dividends, offset by the impact of share repurchases of $0.3 billion and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $0.4 billion.
 
Book value per outstanding share was $30.03 as of March 31, 2006. Debt/capital ratio as of March 31, 2006 was 17.0 percent, down from 20.6 percent at March 31, 2005.
 
The Company maintained substantial liquidity with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2006. Fixed charge coverage remained strong at 7.2 times. The Company's investment portfolio quality remained high.
 
 
Asset Accumulation and Income Segment  First Quarter 2006 Results
 
The AA&I segment includes Securities America Financial Corporation (SAFC), previously reported in the Corporate segment. All prior period information conforms to the current period presentation. The AA&I segment was not impacted by the results of AMEX Assurance.
 
Pre-tax segment income was $228 million for the first quarter, up 31 percent from $174 million in the first quarter of 2005. Solid year-over-year results primarily reflected an 11 percent increase in owned, managed and administered assets driven by strong flows in wrap products and variable annuities, market appreciation, an 18 percent increase in GDC reflecting strong advisor productivity and a $24 million decline in legal and regulatory expenses. Partially offsetting this strong performance were lower account values in both fixed annuity and certificate products and higher interest crediting rates on certificates.

The non-GAAP presentation in this report excludes items that are a direct result of the separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures, which it views as important indicators of financial performance, include: 
 
Consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs;
 - 
 
Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance;
 - 
 
Total expenses before separation costs;
 - 
 
Adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 -

 - 
 
Adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 -

Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
Reclassification
 
Certain prior period information has been restated to conform to current period presentation. Specifically, all share and per share information have been retroactively adjusted for the  stock split of the Company's common shares as of September 30, 2005 into 246.2 million common shares.

Under the separation agreement with American Express, 100 percent of this business was ceded to an American Express subsidiary in return for an arm's length ceding fee. Ameriprise Financial expects to sell the legal entity of AMEX Assurance to American Express within two years after September 30, 2005 for a fixed price equal to the net book value of AMEX Assurance.
AMEX Assurance Company
 
This segment offers products and services, both the Company's and other companies', to help the Company's retail clients address identified financial objectives related to asset accumulation and income management. Products and services in this segment are related to financial advice, asset management, brokerage and banking and include mutual funds, wrap accounts, variable and fixed annuities, brokerage accounts, financial advice services and investment certificates. This operating segment also serves institutional clients by providing investment management services in separately managed accounts, sub-advisory, alternative investments and 401(k) markets.

These fees are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. The Company also earns net investment income on owned assets, principally supporting the fixed annuity business, and distribution fees on sales of mutual funds and other products. This segment includes the results of Securities America Financial Corporation, which through its operating subsidiary, operates its own separately branded distribution network.

As of March 31, 2006
Source of Data:  Lipper
 
Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges. Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date. When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  the point of purchase return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the fund at the maximum sales charge. Sales charges vary depending on the amount of your purchase. For more information regarding sales charges, please refer to the fund's prospectus. RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund come from the Lipper database. Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total. Please see page 12 to find total RiverSource Fund assets as of the quarter end.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each fund had fee waivers not been in place.

The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies involve substantial risk. Historically, these stocks have experienced greater price volatility than stocks of larger companies, and they can be expected to do so in the future.
 
Stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be slightly less volatile than those of small-capitalization companies but still involve substantial risk.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may under perform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
