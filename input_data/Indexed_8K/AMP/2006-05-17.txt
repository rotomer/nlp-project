Other Events.
 
On May 15, 2006, a NASD panel issued a decision in a securities industry arbitration proceeding captioned Securities America, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. The arbitrators ruled against Securities America, Inc., and awarded the plaintiffs approximately $19.6 million.
Wayland Adams et al vs. David McFadden and Securities America, Inc.
 
Securities America disagrees with the arbitration panel's decision and intends to file a motion to vacate the award.
 
If the award is sustained, we believe its impact, net of applicable reserves, would not be material to Ameriprise Financial's earnings.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
