(l) Neither (i) the execution or delivery hereof by the Company, (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Notes by the Company nor (iv) compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes, will conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or other governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound, or to which any of their properties is subject, nor will any such action or the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder violate any law, rule, administrative regulation or decree of any court, or any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge, claim or encumbrance upon any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as in each case would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Except for permits, consents, approvals and similar authorizations required under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of certain jurisdictions, and except for such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations which have been obtained, no permit, consent, approval, authorization or order of any court, governmental agency or body or financial institution is required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (m) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, and is enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (n) None of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (i) is in violation of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other governing documents, (ii) is in default and no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the due performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition contained in any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it is 5
bound or to which any of its properties is subject, except for any such defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) is in violation of any law, ordinance, governmental rule, regulation or court decree to which it or its property may be subject, except for any such violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

Neither the filing of the Registration Statement nor the offering or sale of the Notes as contemplated by this Agreement gives rise to any rights, other than those which have been duly waived or satisfied, for or relating to the registration of any securities of the Company. The capitalization of the Company as of the date of the most recent balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus is as set forth in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to issue, sell and deliver the Notes in accordance with and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus. All corporate action required to be taken by the Company for the authorization, issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes to be sold by the Company hereunder has been validly and sufficiently taken.

(r) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, the stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Notes to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.

(t) There is and has been no failure on the part of the Company or any of the Company's directors or officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith. (u) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries maintains a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect thereto. (v) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act; such disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within those entities; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in (x) providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company is required to file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required, and (y) providing reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (w) The Company possesses all licenses, certificates, permits and other authorizations issued by the appropriate national and local U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities necessary to conduct its businesses, except to the extent that the failure to possess any such licenses, permits or other authorizations will not have a Material Adverse Effect on the current or future financial position or results of operations of the Company, and the Company has not received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of any such license, certificate, permit or other authorization that, singly or in the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the current or future financial position or results of operations of the Company, except as set forth in or as contemplated by the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus. 7

The Company will advise you, promptly when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes (or is deemed to have become) effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed. The Company will prepare one or more final term sheets, containing solely a description of the Notes, substantially in the form of Schedule I hereto and approved by the Representative and file such term sheet or term sheets pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time period prescribed by such Rule.

If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or file any document to comply with the Securities Act, the Company will promptly notify you and will, subject to Section 4(a) hereof, amend the Registration Statement, amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or file any document (in each case, at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and will furnish without charge to each Underwriter as many written and electronic copies of any such amendment or supplement as the Representative may from time to time reasonably request.

All opinions, certificates, letters and documents referred to in this Section 6 will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are satisfactory in form and substance to you and to counsel for the Underwriters.

(c) Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it will notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ a single counsel to represent all of the Underwriters (and to the extent necessary, a single local counsel in each jurisdiction in which proceedings have been brought) who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under such subsection if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 8(a) or 8(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to 21
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 8(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 8(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to investors were offered to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 8(c) above). (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8, to the respective officers and directors of the Underwriters and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 will be in addition to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and will extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, 22
is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 9. SUBSTITUTION OF UNDERWRITERS. If any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters will be obligated to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in Schedule I hereto) the principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to you who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 8 hereof. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 9. Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default. If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to you are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representative may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order to effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representative may thereby be made necessary. 10. TERMINATION. Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by you by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (a) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder; (b) any of the events described in Sections 6(k) and 6(l), shall have occurred; or (c) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(e) and 8 hereof. Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section 12 hereof in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or telephone, will be immediately confirmed in writing. 23
11. SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. The agreements contained in Section 8 hereof and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained in Sections 1 and 4 hereof will survive the delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters hereunder and will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 12.

RESEARCH ANALYST INDEPENDENCE. The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters' research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters' research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the offering that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions. The Company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 14. NO FIDUCIARY DUTY. The Company acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the offering and the sale of the Notes or any other services the Underwriters may be deemed to be providing hereunder, notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by the Underwriters: (i) no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Company and any other person, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, exists; (ii) the Underwriters are not acting as advisors, expert or otherwise, to the Company, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of the public offering price of the Notes, and such relationship between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, is entirely and 24
solely commercial, based on arms-length negotiations; (iii) any duties and obligations that the Underwriters may have to the Company shall be limited to those duties and obligations specifically stated herein; and (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company hereby waives any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach of fiduciary duty in connection with this offering. 15. PARTIES. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the several Underwriters, the Company and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (a) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement will also be deemed to be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (b) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 8 hereof will be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act.

The Company executed and delivered the Base Indenture to the Trustee to provide for the issuance from time to time of its junior subordinated notes, debentures, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter generally called the "DEBT SECURITIES," and individually, a "DEBT SECURITY") to be issued in one or more series as might be determined by the Company under the Base Indenture, in an unlimited aggregate principal amount which may be authenticated and delivered as provided in the Base Indenture; Pursuant to the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture, the Company desires to provide for the establishment of a new series Debt Securities to be known as the "7.518% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066" (the "NOTES"), the form and substance of such Notes and the terms, provisions and conditions thereof to be as set forth in the Indenture; The Company has requested that the Trustee execute and deliver this First Supplemental Indenture. All requirements necessary to make this First Supplemental Indenture a valid instrument in accordance with its terms (and to make the Notes, when duly executed by the Company and duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, the valid and enforceable obligations of the Company) have been performed, and the execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized in all respects.

(c) the singular includes the plural and vice versa; (d) unless otherwise specified, any reference to a Section or Article is to a Section or Article of this First Supplemental Indenture; (e) headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect interpretation; (f) any reference herein to an agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of securities contemplated therein as of May 26, 2006 shall mean such agreement as it may be amended, modified or supplemented in accordance with its terms; and (g) the following terms have the following meanings: "3-MONTH LIBOR" means, with respect to an Interest Payment Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per year) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a 3-month period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such Interest Payment Period.

(c) PERIOD OF ACCRUAL. Subject to Section 2.05(a)(iii), interest will accrue from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the Interest Payment Date on which the interest is actually paid or the Stated Maturity, as the case may be. (d) DUTIES OF CALCULATION AGENT. The Calculation Agent will calculate the Floating Rate for the Notes and the amount of interest payable on each Floating Rate Interest Payment Date. Promptly upon such determination, the Calculation Agent will notify the Company and, if the Trustee is not then serving as the Calculation Agent, the Trustee, of the Floating Rate for the new quarterly Interest Payment Period.

Section 2.06 OPTIONAL DEFERRAL OF INTEREST. (a) OPTIONAL EXTENSION PERIOD. Subject to Section 2.08 and Section 3.02, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and as long as no Trigger Event has occurred and no Trigger Period caused thereby is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time, to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the Interest Payment Period on the Notes for a period (an "OPTIONAL EXTENSION PERIOD") not exceeding ten years following the first Interest Payment Date in such period on which interest was deferred, during which Optional Extension Period deferred interest on the Notes shall not be 12
due and payable but will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the then applicable rate of interest on the notes; provided that no such Optional Extension Period may end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date or extend beyond the stated maturity of the Notes. At the end of any Optional Extension Period, the Company may settle any and all Optionally Deferred Interest with cash from any source until the date that is five years following the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company commenced an Optional Extension Period on the Notes. Thereafter, subject to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, the Company must immediately and continuously use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell shares of Common Stock and to use the proceeds therefrom to pay any outstanding Optionally Deferred Interest in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.02. If a Trigger Event occurs after commencement of an Optional Extension Period, the Optional Extension Period will be deemed suspended for so long as the Trigger Period is continuing. Once the Trigger Period is no longer continuing, the right of the Company to optionally defer payment of interest will continue, subject to the limitations and consequences described herein. The first Interest Payment Date on which the Company defers the payment of any interest (whether due to an optional deferral or the occurrence of a Trigger Event) will commence an Optional Extension Period. This Optional Extension Period will not be considered terminated until the first date thereafter when all accrued and unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest, has been paid by the Company. An Optional Extension Period may not, under any circumstances, extend beyond the tenth anniversary of its commencement or beyond the stated maturity date of the Notes. When and if an Optional Extension Period is terminated because the Company has paid in full all accrued and unpaid interest then owed by the Company, together with any Compounded Interest thereupon, the Company may commence a new Optional Extension Period, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.06, there being no limit to the number of such new Optional Extension Period that the Company may commence. (b) COVENANTS. During an Optional Extension Period, the Company shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3.01 of this First Supplemental Indenture. (c) NOTICES.

(b) TRIGGER EVENT. "TRIGGER EVENT" means a determination by the Company that any of the following conditions exists as of the day that is the thirtieth day prior to any Interest Payment Date (or, in the event that such date is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) (a "TRIGGER DETERMINATION DATE"): (i) the Risk-Based Capital Ratio for all Covered Life Insurance Subsidiaries, calculated on a combined basis, is less than 175% based on the most recent annual financial statements that such Covered Life Insurance Subsidiaries have filed with applicable state insurance commissioners; or (ii) (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount for the period ending at the end of the fiscal quarter that ends two fiscal quarters prior to the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to such Trigger Determination Date is zero or a negative amount, and (y) the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Amount as of the end of the most recently completed quarter and as of the end of the fiscal quarter that ends two quarters prior to such most recently completed fiscal quarter has declined by 10% or more as compared to the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Amount at the end of the fiscal quarter (the "BENCHMARK QUARTER") that is the later of (1) the quarter ended March 31, 2005 or (2) the quarter that is ten quarters prior to the most recently completed fiscal quarter. In the case of a Trigger Event arising under clause (ii) above, the Trigger Period shall continue until the Company satisfies both of the tests in clauses (i) and (ii) above as of the Trigger Determination Date applicable to any subsequent Interest Payment Date, and the Company's Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Amount has increased, or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Amount at the end of the Benchmark Quarter with respect to the Trigger Period for which interest payment restrictions were imposed under clause (ii) above.

Stockholders' Equity Amount as of a fiscal quarter end is higher or lower than it would have been absent such change, then, for purposes of the calculations described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this Section 2.07, commencing with the fiscal quarter for which such change in GAAP becomes effective, the Adjusted Common Stockholders' Equity Amount shall be calculated on a pro forma basis as if such change had not occurred. (d) CHANGES IN THE MODEL ACT. If a change in the Model Act results in (1) a change in the mathematical relationship between the Company Action Level and the Authorized Control Level, or (2) any similar recalibration or re-scaling of the levels of Total Adjusted Capital that a life insurance company must possess in order to avoid triggering particular company action or regulatory action (whether mandatory or authorized) under the Model Act, then for purposes of making the calculations described in clause (i) of the definition of "Trigger Event," commencing with the first year for which such change becomes effective, the conditions for the occurrence of a Trigger Event will be changed to correspondingly adjust the 175% Risk-Based Capital Ratio set forth in such clause (i), as determined and verified by a nationally recognized independent actuarial consulting firm that is designated by a nationally recognized accounting firm that is not the independent registered public accounting firm that is the Company's auditors at the time of such designation.

(g) PAYMENT OF MANDATORILY DEFERRED INTEREST. Mandatorily Deferred Interest on the Notes may only be satisfied using the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism except upon an Event of Default, in which case such Mandatorily Deferred Interest may be satisfied without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. In the event that a Trigger Period is no longer continuing, subsequent interest may be paid in cash without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. (h) NOTICES. By not later than the 15th day prior to each Interest Payment Date for which the Interest Payment Period is being extended by reason of a Trigger Event, the Company shall give notice of such Trigger Period as follows: (i) by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders; or (ii) as to any Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, by e-mail, fax, or any other manner as agreed to by the Company and the Holder of the Global Note. 15
Copies of any such notice to a Holder, if given by the Company, shall be mailed to the Trustee at the same time. Such notice, in addition to stating that interest payments will be deferred, shall set forth (x) the Risk-Based Capital Ratio for any relevant Covered Life Insurance Subsidiary, if the Trigger Event has been triggered by the test set forth in Section 2.07(b)(i) hereof, or (y) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount and the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Amount for the relevant periods and dates, if the Trigger Event has been triggered by the test set forth in Section 2.07(b)(ii) hereof, and, in either case, (z) the amount by which the Risk-Based Capital Ratio or the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Amount, as the case may be, must increase in order for the Trigger Period to cease and for interest payments to be resumed. Copies of any such notice to a Holder, if given by the Company, shall be mailed to the Trustee at the same time. Section 2.08 DEFERRAL OF INTEREST IN GENERAL.

(b) The first paragraph of Section 7.02 of the Base Indenture is hereby modified with respect to the Notes by replacing the same with the following: "If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare the principal amount of all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration, such principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest (other than Foregone Interest, in the event of a Bankruptcy Default), and premium, if payable, shall become immediately due and payable; provided, however, the payment of such principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in the Indenture. Upon payment of such amount in the Currency in which the Notes are denominated (except as otherwise provided pursuant to Sections 3.01), all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of principal of the Notes shall terminate." (c) The use of sources of funding other than the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism to fund interest payments during a Trigger Period is not an Event of Default. Section 2.11 COVENANT DEFAULTS. (a)The Base Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented with respect to the Notes as follows: 17
(i) The last paragraph of Section 7.03 is amended in its entirety as follows: "If an Event of Default or a TIA Covenant Default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of the Notes by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy." (ii) Section 7.03 is further supplemented by adding the following paragraph following the last paragraph, as amended, in clause (i) above: "If a Covenant Default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. If a Covenant Default other than a TIA Covenant Default with respect to the Notes occurs and is continuing, and then only if the Trustee is directed by Holders pursuant to and in accordance with Section 7.12 of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the Holders of the Notes by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such Holders shall so direct to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy." (iii) Section 7.07, clause (1) is amended in its entirety as follows: "an Event of Default or Covenant Default shall have occurred and be continuing and such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default or Covenant Default, as the case may be, with respect to such series." (iv) Section 7.07, clause (2) is amended in its entirety as follows: "the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount, in the case of an Event of Default, or a majority in principal amount, in the case of a Covenant Default, of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default or such Covenant Default, as the case may be, in its own name as Trustee hereunder." (v) Section 7.11 is amended in its entirety as follows: "No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default or Covenant Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or Covenant Default or any acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be." (vi) Section 8.1(b) is amended in its entirety as follows: "In case an Event of Default or a TIA Covenant Default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall, with respect to the Notes, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their 18
exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs." (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Covenant Default shall not constitute an Event of Default and shall not give rise to any of the rights or duties set forth in Section 7.02 of the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented with respect to the Notes by this First Supplemental Indenture. Section 2.12 DESIGNATION OF DEPOSITARY. Initially, the Depositary for the Notes will be The Depository Trust Company.

Section 2.17 OTHER. (a) The provisions contained in Article Five of the Base Indenture and, without limiting the provisions of Section 4.01 of this First Supplemental Indenture, any provisions in the Base Indenture relating to the Issuer Trusts shall not apply to the Notes. (b) The Company agrees, and by acquiring an interest in a Note each beneficial owner of a Note agrees, to treat the Notes as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes. ARTICLE III COVENANTS Article Twelve of the Base Indenture is hereby supplemented with respect to the Notes by the following additional covenants of the Company: Section 3.01 LIMITATION ON COMPANY PAYMENTS. During any Extension Period and until such time as all accrued but unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest thereon, is paid in full, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to): 19
(a) declare or pay any dividends on, make distributions regarding, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of the capital stock of the Company, other than: (i) purchases of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employee or agent benefit plans or the satisfaction of the Company's obligations under any contract or security outstanding on such date requiring the Company to purchase its capital stock, or under any dividend reinvestment plan; (ii) in connection with the reclassification of any class or series of capital stock of the Company or the exchange or the conversion of one class or series of the capital stock of the Company for or into another class or series of the capital stock of the Company; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the capital stock of the Company in connection with the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) dividends or distributions in the Company's capital stock, or rights to acquire Common Stock, or repurchases or redemptions of Common Stock solely from the issuance or exchange of Common Stock; (v) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan, or the issuances of capital stock under any such plan in the future, or redemptions or repurchases of any rights outstanding pursuant to a Company shareholder rights plan; or (vi) acquisitions of Common Stock in connection with any acquisitions of businesses made by the Company (which acquisitions by the Company are made in connection with the satisfaction of indemnification obligations of the sellers of such businesses); (b) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities issued by the Company that rank pari passu with or junior in interest to the Notes other than any payment, repurchase or redemption in respect of Parity Debt Securities made ratably and in proportion to the respective amount of (1) accrued and unpaid amounts on such Parity Debt Securities, on the one hand, and (2) accrued and unpaid amounts on the Notes, on the other hand; and (c) make any guarantee payments with respect to any guarantee by the Company of the Debt Securities of any Subsidiary of the Company, if such guarantee ranks pari passu with or junior in interest to the Notes, other than any payment in respect of Parity Guarantees made ratably and in proportion to the respective amount of (1) accrued and unpaid amounts on such Parity Guarantees, on the one hand, and (2) accrued and unpaid amounts on the Notes, on the other hand. Section 3.02 ALTERNATIVE COUPON SATISFACTION MECHANISM. (a) Commencing at the date (i) on which a Trigger Event occurs or (ii) that is five-years following the first Interest 20
Payment Date as of which the Company elected to commence an Optional Extension Period, the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to satisfy its obligation to pay interest then outstanding on the Notes by selling Common Stock (including treasury shares and shares of Common Stock sold pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan or employee benefits plan) (the "ALTERNATIVE COUPON SATISFACTION MECHANISM"), the proceeds of which shall be paid to the Holders, in satisfaction of the accrued but unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest thereon, then due on the Notes. Mandatorily Deferred Interest on the Notes may only be satisfied using the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism except if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case such interest obligation may be satisfied without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. In the event that a Trigger Period is no longer continuing, subsequent interest may be paid in cash without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. (b) The Company is not permitted to sell shares of Common Stock in excess of a number of shares of Common Stock which at May 26, 2006 is equal to 55,000,000 (the "SHARE CAP AMOUNT"), for the purpose of satisfying the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism or otherwise paying deferred interest on the Notes. The Company may, at its discretion, increase the Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) if the Company determines that such increase is necessary to allow it to issue sufficient shares to satisfy its obligations to pay deferred interest on the Notes pursuant to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism or otherwise pay deferred interest on the Notes. If the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. (c) The net proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of shares of Common Stock (i) starting at such date that is 180 days prior to any Interest Payment Date on which the Company intends to use the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism and (ii) designated by the Company at or before the time of such issuance as available to pay interest on the Notes will, at the time such proceeds are delivered to the Trustee to satisfy the relevant interest payment, be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligations to pay interest on the Notes pursuant to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism pursuant to the preceding clause (a). (d) In the event that the Company extends the Interest Payment Period on the Notes and on other Parity Debt Securities that contain similar requirements to pay Mandatorily Deferred Interest pursuant to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism, the Company will apply any net proceeds so raised on a pro rata basis towards its obligations to pay interest on the Notes and on such Parity Debt Securities. ARTICLE IV SUBORDINATION Section 4.01 SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS. "Senior Indebtedness" for all purposes of this Indenture shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Base Indenture and shall also include the principal, premium, if any, and interest on (including interest accruing on or after the 21
filing of any petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not such claim for post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding): (a) all senior, senior subordinated, subordinated and other indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding on the date of the issuance of the Notes or thereafter created, incurred or assumed, which is for money borrowed (including, without limitation, the Company's 5.35% Senior Notes due 2010, 5.65% Senior Notes due 2015 and any amounts borrowed under the Company's $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility or any amounts owed by the Company under any debentures or similar instruments issued in connection with any "trust preferred securities"), or which is otherwise evidenced by a note or similar instrument; (b) all obligations of the Company under leases required or permitted to be capitalized under GAAP; (c) any indebtedness of any other Person of the kinds described in the preceding clause (a), for the payment of which the Company or its property is responsible or liable as guarantor or otherwise; and (d) amendments, modifications, renewals, extensions, deferrals and refundings of any of the forgoing types of indebtedness. Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be Senior Indebtedness and to be entitled to the benefits of the subordination provisions of the Indenture irrespective of any amendment, modification or waiver of any term of the Senior Indebtedness, or any extension or renewal of the Senior Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or in the Base Indenture, Senior Indebtedness shall not include (i) any accounts payable or other liability to trade creditors, (ii) any indebtedness which by its terms is expressly made pari passu with or subordinated to the Notes, (iii) obligations owed by the Company to any of its subsidiaries or (iv) any liability for federal, state, local or other taxes owed or owing by the Company or its subsidiaries. ARTICLE V MISCELLANEOUS Section 5.01 MEETINGS AND VOTING. (a)Section 9.3 of the Base Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented with respect to the Notes such that the request of the Holders of at least 25% of the Outstanding Debt Securities of a series or of all series, as the case may be, shall be required to call a meeting of Holders. (b) With respect to the Notes, any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by the Base Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent or proxy duly appointed in writing; and, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Base Indenture, such action will become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where expressly required, to the Company. Whenever Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount may take any act, such act may be evidenced by: (i) instruments executed by Holders; (ii) the record of 22
Holders voting in favor thereof at any meeting of the Holders; or (iii) a combination of such instruments and any such record of such a meeting of Holders. Section 5.02 RATIFICATION OF INDENTURE. The Base Indenture, as supplemented and amended by this First Supplemental Indenture, is ratified and confirmed, and this First Supplemental Indenture shall be deemed part of the Base Indenture with respect to the Notes in the manner and to the extent herein and therein provided. If any provision of this First Supplemental Indenture is inconsistent with a provision of the Base Indenture, the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture shall control. Section 5.03 TRUSTEE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RECITALS. The recitals contained herein are made by the Company and not by the Trustee, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness thereof. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this First Supplemental Indenture. Section 5.04 GOVERNING LAW. This First Supplemental Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Section 5.05 SEVERABILITY. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this First Supplemental Indenture or in the Notes shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this First Supplemental Indenture or of the Notes, but this First Supplemental Indenture and the Notes shall be construed as if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein. Section 5.06 COUNTERPARTS. This First Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Section 5.07 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and agreements in the Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether expressed or not. The Company will have the right at all times to assign any of its respective rights or obligations under the Indenture to a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company; provided that, in the event of any such assignment, the Company will remain liable for all of its respective obligations. Subject to the foregoing, the Indenture will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties thereto and their respective successors and assigns. The Indenture may not otherwise be assigned by the parties thereto. 22

[REVERSE OF NOTE] AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 7.518% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTE DUE 2066 To the extent that any rights or other provisions of this Note differ from or are inconsistent with those contained in the Indenture, then the Indenture shall control. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 1. Principal and Interest AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC., a Delaware corporation (including any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, the "COMPANY"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the Fixed Rate from May 26, 2006 to June 1, 2016, and at the Floating Rate from June 1, 2016 to the Stated Maturity. Subject to Section 2.06, Section 2.07 and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture, (a) during the Fixed Rate Period, this Note will accrue interest at a rate per annum of 7.518% of the principal amount of $1,000 per Note, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year (each a "FIXED RATE INTEREST PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on December 1, 2006 and (b) during the Floating Rate Period, this Note will accrue interest at a rate per annum of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 290.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each a "FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENT DATE" and together with the Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date, an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on June 1, 2016. Interest not paid on any Interest Payment Date, including any interest deferred during any Extension Period, will accrue and compound at the from time to time then applicable interest rate (whether semi-annually at the Fixed Rate or quarterly at the Floating Rate, as the case may be), as provided in the Indenture. Subject to Section 2.05(a)(iii), such interest will accrue and compound to the date that it is actually paid. The amount of interest on this Note payable for any Interest Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period shall be computed (i) for any full Interest Payment Period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, (ii) for any period shorter than a full Interest Payment Period, on the basis of a 30-day month and (iii) for any period shorter than a 30-day month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the 30-day month. Floating Rate interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the 360-day year. 2. Optional Deferral of Interest Subject to Section 2.06 and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and no Trigger Event has occurred and no Trigger Period caused thereby is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and A-5
from time to time, to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the Interest Payment Period on the Notes for a period (an "OPTIONAL EXTENSION PERIOD") not exceeding ten years, during which Optional Extension Period deferred interest on the Notes shall not be due and payable but will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the then applicable rate of interest on the notes; provided that no such Optional Extension Period may end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date or extend beyond the stated maturity of the Notes. At the end of any Optional Extension Period, the Company may settle any and all Optionally Deferred Interest with cash from any source until the date that is five years following the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company commenced an Optional Extension Period on the Notes. Thereafter, subject to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, the Company must immediately and continuously use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell shares of Common Stock and to use the proceeds therefrom to pay any outstanding Optionally Deferred Interest in accordance with the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. If a Trigger Event occurs after commencement of an Optional Extension Period, the Optional Extension Period will be deemed suspended for so long as the Trigger Period is continuing. Once the Trigger Period is no longer continuing, the right of the Company to optionally defer payment of interest will continue, subject to the limitations and consequences described herein. The first Interest Payment Date on which the Company defers the payment of any interest (whether due to an optional deferral or the occurrence of a Trigger Event) will commence an Optional Extension Period. This Optional Extension Period will not be considered terminated until the first date thereafter when all accrued and unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest, has been paid by the Company. An Optional Extension Period may not, under any circumstances, extend beyond the tenth anniversary of its commencement or beyond the stated maturity date of the Notes. When and if an Optional Extension Period is terminated because the Company has paid in full all accrued and unpaid interest then owed by the Company, together with any Compounded Interest thereupon, the Company may commence a new Optional Extension Period, subject to the requirements of Section 2.06, there being no limit to the number of such new Optional Extension Period that the Company may commence. During an Optional Extension Period, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) make the payments or take any of the actions set forth in Section 3.01 of the First Supplemental Indenture. 3. Mandatory Deferral of Interest Subject to Section 2.07 and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture, if and to the extent that a Trigger Event has occurred as of any Trigger Determination Date, the Company shall defer payments of interest on the Notes beginning on the Interest Payment Date immediately following such Trigger Determination Date, thereby extending the Interest Payment Period on the Notes until (but not including) the first subsequent Interest Payment Date for which no Trigger Event has occurred as of the Trigger Determination Date applicable to such Interest Payment Date, but in any event for a period not exceeding ten years (a "TRIGGER A-6
PERIOD"), during which Trigger Period deferred interest on the Notes shall not be due and payable, except to the extent that any such payment is made using the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. By acquiring this Note or an interest herein, the Holder or beneficial owner of this Note, as the case may be, agrees that in the event of a Bankruptcy Default prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption of this Note, any unpaid Mandatorily Deferred Interest in excess of 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of this Note (or the portion of this Note in which such beneficial owner holds an interest) (the "FOREGONE INTEREST") shall not be due and payable and no Holder or beneficial owner will have any claim for, and thus any right to receive, such Foregone Interest. Mandatorily Deferred Interest on the Notes may only be satisfied using the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism except upon an Event of Default, in which case such Mandatorily Deferred Interest may be satisfied without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. In the event that a Trigger Event is no longer continuing, subsequent interest may be paid in cash without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. During a Trigger Period, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) make the payments or take any of the actions set forth in Section 3.01 of the First Supplemental Indenture. 4. Extension Periods in General The Holder of this Note, and each beneficial owner of an interest in this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the deferral provisions in the Indenture, including Section 2.06, Section 2.07, and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture. At the termination of any Extension Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest then accrued and unpaid, together with Compounded Interest, on the Interest Payment Date on which such Extension Period terminates, subject to Section 2.07. An Extension Period will be deemed to terminate upon any redemption or upon any acceleration of the Stated Maturity. In no event shall any Extension Period, whether or not consisting of consecutive Interest Payment Periods, (i) exceed ten years, (ii) end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date or (iii) extend beyond the Stated Maturity. For purposes of calculating the foregoing limitation on Extension Periods, (x) only when all accrued and unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest thereon, has been paid will any Interest Payment Period during which interest has been deferred no longer be included; and (y) after the commencement of an Optional Extension Period, the period from the first Interest Payment Date for which interest was deferred pursuant to Section 2.06 of the First Supplemental Indenture and ending on the Interest Payment Date on which all interest that was deferred pursuant to such Section 2.06, including Compounded Interest, is paid in full, shall be included for purposes of calculating the length of an Optional Extension Period. 5. Method of Payment A-7
Interest on this Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the payment of such interest. As long as the Notes remain in book entry form or are represented by a Global Note, the Regular Record Dates for this Note shall be the Business Day next preceding the corresponding Interest Payment Date. If the Notes are issued in definitive form, the Regular Record Dates for this Note shall be such Business Day selected by the Company that is at least one Business Day prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. 6. Paying Agent and Security Registrar Initially, U.S. Bank National Association, the Trustee, will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. The Company may change the Paying Agent and Security Registrar without notice to any Holder. 7. Indenture This Note is one of a duly authorized series of the 7.518% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066 (the "NOTES") of the Company issued under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 5, 2006 (the "BASE INDENTURE"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture dated May 26, 2006 (the "FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "INDENTURE"), in each case, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "TRUSTEE"). The terms of this Note include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended ("TIA"). This Note is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the TIA for a statement of all such terms.

[REVERSE OF NOTE] AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC. 7.518% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTE DUE 2066 To the extent that any rights or other provisions of this Note differ from or are inconsistent with those contained in the Indenture, then the Indenture shall control. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated. 1. Principal and Interest AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, INC., a Delaware corporation (including any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to, the "COMPANY"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the Fixed Rate from May 26, 2006 to June 1, 2016, and at the Floating Rate from June 1, 2016 to the Stated Maturity. Subject to Section 2.06, Section 2.07 and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture, (a) during the Fixed Rate Period, this Note will accrue interest at a rate per annum of 7.518% of the principal amount of $1,000 per Note, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year (each a "FIXED RATE INTEREST PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on December 1, 2006 and (b) during the Floating Rate Period, this Note will accrue interest at a rate per annum of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 290.5 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year (each a "FLOATING RATE INTEREST PAYMENT DATE" and together with the Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date, an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on June 1, 2016. Interest not paid on any Interest Payment Date, including any interest deferred during any Extension Period, will accrue and compound at the from time to time then applicable interest rate (whether semi-annually at the Fixed Rate or quarterly at the Floating Rate, as the case may be), as provided in the Indenture. Subject to Section 2.05(a)(iii), such interest will accrue and compound to the date that it is actually paid. The amount of interest on this Note payable for any Interest Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Period shall be computed (i) for any full Interest Payment Period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, (ii) for any period shorter than a full Interest Payment Period, on the basis of a 30-day month and (iii) for any period shorter than a 30-day month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the 30-day month. Floating Rate interest on this Note shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the 360-day year. 2. Optional Deferral of Interest
Subject to Section 2.06 and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and no Trigger Event has occurred and no Trigger Period caused thereby is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time, to defer payments of interest on the Notes by extending the Interest Payment Period on the Notes for a period (an "OPTIONAL EXTENSION PERIOD") not exceeding ten years, during which Optional Extension Period deferred interest on the Notes shall not be due and payable but will continue to accrue and compound semi-annually or quarterly, as applicable, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the then applicable rate of interest on the notes; provided that no such Optional Extension Period may end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date or extend beyond the stated maturity of the Notes. At the end of any Optional Extension Period, the Company may settle any and all Optionally Deferred Interest with cash from any source until the date that is five years following the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company commenced an Optional Extension Period on the Notes. Thereafter, subject to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event, the Company must immediately and continuously use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell shares of Common Stock and to use the proceeds therefrom to pay any outstanding Optionally Deferred Interest in accordance with the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. If a Trigger Event occurs after commencement of an Optional Extension Period, the Optional Extension Period will be deemed suspended for so long as the Trigger Period is continuing. Once the Trigger Period is no longer continuing, the right of the Company to optionally defer payment of interest will continue, subject to the limitations and consequences described herein. The first Interest Payment Date on which the Company defers the payment of any interest (whether due to an optional deferral or the occurrence of a Trigger Event) will commence an Optional Extension Period. This Optional Extension Period will not be considered terminated until the first date thereafter when all accrued and unpaid interest, together with any Compounded Interest, has been paid by the Company. An Optional Extension Period may not, under any circumstances, extend beyond the tenth anniversary of its commencement or beyond the stated maturity date of the Notes. When and if an Optional Extension Period is terminated because the Company has paid in full all accrued and unpaid interest then owed by the Company, together with any Compounded Interest thereupon, the Company may commence a new Optional Extension Period, subject to the requirements of Section 2.06, there being no limit to the number of such new Optional Extension Period that the Company may commence. During an Optional Extension Period, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) make the payments or take any of the actions set forth in Section 3.01 of the First Supplemental Indenture. 3. Mandatory Deferral of Interest
Subject to Section 2.07 and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture, if and to the extent that a Trigger Event has occurred as of any Trigger Determination Date, the Company shall defer payments of interest on the Notes beginning on the Interest Payment Date immediately following such Trigger Determination Date, thereby extending the Interest Payment Period on the Notes until (but not including) the first subsequent Interest Payment Date for which no Trigger Event has occurred as of the Trigger Determination Date applicable to such Interest Payment Date, but in any event for a period not exceeding ten years (a "TRIGGER PERIOD"), during which Trigger Period deferred interest on the Notes shall not be due and payable, except to the extent that any such payment is made using the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. By acquiring this Note or an interest herein, the Holder or beneficial owner of this Note, as the case may be, agrees that in the event of a Bankruptcy Default prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption of this Note, any unpaid Mandatorily Deferred Interest in excess of 25% of the then outstanding principal amount of this Note (or the portion of this Note in which such beneficial owner holds an interest) (the "FOREGONE INTEREST") shall not be due and payable and no Holder or beneficial owner will have any claim for, and thus any right to receive, such Foregone Interest. Mandatorily Deferred Interest on the Notes may only be satisfied using the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism except upon an Event of Default, in which case such Mandatorily Deferred Interest may be satisfied without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. In the event that a Trigger Event is no longer continuing, subsequent interest may be paid in cash without regard to the Alternative Coupon Satisfaction Mechanism. During a Trigger Period, the Company shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) make the payments or take any of the actions set forth in Section 3.01 of the First Supplemental Indenture. 4. Extension Periods in General The Holder of this Note, and each beneficial owner of an interest in this Note, by accepting the same, agrees to and shall be bound by the deferral provisions in the Indenture, including Section 2.06, Section 2.07, and Section 2.08 of the First Supplemental Indenture. At the termination of any Extension Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest then accrued and unpaid, together with Compounded Interest, on the Interest Payment Date on which such Extension Period terminates, subject to Section 2.07. An Extension Period will be deemed to terminate upon any redemption or upon any acceleration of the Stated Maturity. In no event shall any Extension Period, whether or not consisting of consecutive Interest Payment Periods, (i) exceed ten years, (ii) end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date or (iii) extend beyond the Stated Maturity. For purposes of calculating the foregoing limitation on Extension Periods, (x) only when all accrued and unpaid interest,
together with any Compounded Interest thereon, has been paid will any Interest Payment Period during which interest has been deferred no longer be included; and (y) after the commencement of an Optional Extension Period, the period from the first Interest Payment Date for which interest was deferred pursuant to Section 2.06 of the First Supplemental Indenture and ending on the Interest Payment Date on which all interest that was deferred pursuant to such Section 2.06, including Compounded Interest, is paid in full, shall be included for purposes of calculating the length of an Optional Extension Period. 5. Method of Payment Interest on this Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered in the Security Register at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for the payment of such interest. As long as the Notes remain in book entry form or are represented by a Global Note, the Regular Record Dates for this Note shall be the Business Day next preceding the corresponding Interest Payment Date. If the Notes are issued in definitive form, the Regular Record Dates for this Note shall be such Business Day selected by the Company that is at least one Business Day prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date. 6. Paying Agent and Security Registrar Initially, U.S. Bank National Association, the Trustee, will act as Paying Agent and Security Registrar. The Company may change the Paying Agent and Security Registrar without notice to any Holder. 7. Indenture This Note is one of a duly authorized series of the 7.518% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066 (the "NOTES") of the Company issued under a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 5, 2006 (the "BASE INDENTURE"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Junior Subordinated Indenture dated May 26, 2006 (the "FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "INDENTURE"), in each case, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "TRUSTEE").

Exhibit 8.1 [WACHTELL, LIPTON, ROSEN & KATZ LETTERHEAD] May 26, 2006 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. 55 Ameriprise Financial Center Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as counsel to Ameriprise Financial, Inc, a Delaware corporation ("AMERIPRISE"), in connection with the Registration Statement filed on May 5, 2006, as amended through the date hereof, and the Prospectus Supplement dated the date hereof (the "OFFERING DOCUMENTS"), for the purpose of selling $500,000,000 principal amount of 7.518% Junior Subordinated Notes (the "NOTES") due June 1, 2066. In connection with this opinion, we have examined the form of Indenture of Ameriprise and the form of Note, each to be entered into in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Offering Documents and such other documents and corporate records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinion. In our examination, we have assumed that (i) the statements concerning the issuance of the Notes contained in the Offering Documents are true, correct and complete, (ii) the terms of the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph will be complied with, (iii) the factual representations made to us by the Company in its officer's certificate dated as of the date hereof and delivered to us for purposes of this opinion (the "OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE") are true, correct and complete, and (iv) any factual representations made in the Offering Documents or the Officer's Certificate "to the best knowledge of," in the "belief" of, or similarly qualified are true,
May 26, 2006 Page 2 correct and complete without such qualification. If any of the above described assumptions are untrue for any reason or if the issuance of the Notes is consummated in a manner that is inconsistent with the manner in which it is described in the Offering Documents, our opinion as expressed below may be adversely affected and may not be relied upon. Subject to and based solely upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, (1) the Notes will be treated as indebtedness of Ameriprise for United States federal income tax purposes (although there is no controlling authority directly on point) and (2) insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal tax law, the discussion set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the heading, "CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS," is a fair and accurate summary of the matters discussed therein. We are rendering this opinion to you solely in connection with the Prospectus Supplement, and this opinion is not to be relied upon by any other person or for any other purpose. Very truly yours, /s/ Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz

Exhibit 23.1 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. 55 Ameriprise Financial Center Minneapolis, Minnesota We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as an exhibit to the Form 8-K to be filed with the Commission in connection with the issuance and sale of the 7.518% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2066 of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. /s/ Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz - ----------------------------------- Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz May 26, 2006
