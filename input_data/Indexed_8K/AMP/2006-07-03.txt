Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 27, 2006, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") took the following actions related to the incentive compensation of the Company's executive officers:
2006-2008 Long-Term Performance Plan Goals
Pursuant to the provisions of the Ameriprise Financial 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Ameriprise ICP"), the Committee approved the performance measures and goals underlying the 2006-2008 Long-Term Performance Plan awards and the individual target values for certain of our employees, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and each of the other four executive officers named in the summary compensation table in the Company's 2006 proxy statement (the "named executive officers").
The Long-Term Performance Plan is a three-year cash-denominated plan, with overlapping annual awards. We previously called these types of awards Portfolio Grants, but we will refer to them as Long-Term Performance Plan awards going forward. The goals for the 2006-2008 awards are based upon the attainment of weighted financial objectives  earnings per share growth (40%), gross revenue growth (30%) and average return on equity (30%). The payout value of an award can be increased or decreased by as much as 25%, based on the Company's relative total shareholder return (share price appreciation plus dividends) during the performance period, compared with an industry peer group.
Section 162(m) Long-Term Performance Pool Plan for 2007 and 2008
Pursuant to the Ameriprise ICP, the Committee established a Section 162(m) Long-Term Performance Pool Plan ("Long-Term Pool Plan") for each of 2007 and 2008. Any awards earned from the Long-Term Pool Plan will be paid in the first quarter of the following year. Only the Company's five named executive officers, determined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, are eligible to participate in the Long-Term Pool Plan. The Committee intends that any awards made under this arrangement will qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) and therefore be eligible as a federal income tax deduction for the Company. Accordingly, the Committee approved the goals for the Long-Term Pool Plan for 2007 and 2008  a percentage of the Company's adjusted net income for each year. "Adjusted net income" means the Company's reported net income adjusted to exclude income and losses from discontinued operations, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, the operations of AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs. The Committee also approved the maximum percentage of the award pool for each year under this arrangement that may be paid to a named executive officer.
If an executive qualifies for a payout under the Long-Term Pool Plan for 2007 or 2008, he or she will receive an award payout under this arrangement, and the executive's outstanding 2005-2007 award or 2006-2008 award, respectively, under the Long-Term Performance Plan will be cancelled.
The Committee may exercise negative discretion to reduce the maximum amount of the bonus pool allocated to a named executive officer to a payout level commensurate with the award that would have otherwise been paid to that officer under the Long-Term Performance Plan.
