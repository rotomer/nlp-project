Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
              
 
On July 25, 2006, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2006.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.  In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance Company ("AMEX Assurance") and non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs; Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs); adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before discontinued operations and separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios and ratios of earnings to fixed charges that exclude the effect of nonrecourse debt of a collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and nonrecourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this nonrecourse debt better represent our capital structure. In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes we issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.
 
The computation of the Company's ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the six months ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 and the five years ended December 31, 2005 is set forth on Exhibit 99.3, which is furnished herewith.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  July 25, 2006 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $141 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 versus income before discontinued operations of $149 million for the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 22 percent to $195 million in the second quarter of 2006 compared to the second quarter of 2005. Adjusted earnings exclude income from discontinued operations, after-tax non-recurring separation costs and after-tax earnings of AMEX Assurance in the 2005 period, a business that remained with American Express.(1)
 
Net income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2006 was $0.57. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2006 were $0.79, up 22 percent from the year-ago period. Both per share amounts are based on an average diluted share count of 248 million.
 
Revenues grew 8 percent to $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2006. Adjusted revenues, which exclude the impact of AMEX Assurance, grew 13 percent, reflecting solid growth in retail client activity, which resulted in higher management fees, distribution fees and premiums. "Other" revenues were positively impacted by the proceeds from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business, contributing 4 percentage points of the adjusted revenue growth.
 
Return on equity for the 12 months ended June 30, 2006 was 7.1 percent. Adjusted return on equity increased to 10.7 percent from 10.4 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2006. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1 million shares for approximately $42 million.
 
"We had a solid operating quarter and continue to gain significant traction against our strategic objectives, reflecting the benefits of the diversification within our integrated business model," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "We are exceeding our revenue and earnings targets and continue to drive improvement in return on equity.
 
"A key factor in our success in the quarter is the continued stability and increased productivity of our advisor force. Branded advisor retention remains stable at high levels and advisor productivity increased significantly, reflected in strong growth in gross dealer concession and advisor cash sales, in spite of the turbulent market environment. In addition, we continue to attract mass affluent clients into our base.
 
(1) See definitions and reconciliations throughout the release.
"Owned and managed net flows approached $2 billion in the quarter as we saw continued strong sales in wrap and variable annuity products and net outflows in RiverSource Funds were essentially cut in half due to both increased sales and lower redemptions. I am pleased with the progress we're making.
 
"With regard to our operating segments, our Asset Accumulation and Income segment results were led by continued improvements in our brokerage business driven by strong wrap net flows and other brokerage activity. The variable annuity business continues to experience strong net flows both within Ameriprise and through third parties. Our exposure to spread products, primarily certificates and fixed annuities, declined as we continue to manage our exposure to the yield curve.
 
"Within the Protection segment, we feel good about our results as we continue to gain market share in variable universal life, universal life and auto and home insurance. Profitability in our disability income insurance business has returned to historical levels after higher claims in the first quarter of the year. In addition, long term care insurance experienced lower-than-usual claims in the quarter; however, we see this as an anomaly rather than a trend."
 
Second Quarter 2006 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude discontinued operations, non-recurring separation costs and AMEX Assurance. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in the Company's annual report and Form 10-K for year-end 2005, filed March 8, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Second Quarter 2006 Consolidated Business Highlights
 
Performance against shareholder targets remains strong with adjusted revenues up 13 percent, adjusted earnings up 22 percent and adjusted return on equity of 10.7 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Strong productivity increases drove 15 percent growth in total Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) from the year-ago period, reflecting a 12 percent increase in branded advisor cash sales combined with continued strong net flows into advisor managed wrap accounts. Per branded advisor GDC increased 14 percent from the second quarter of 2005.
 - 
                 
 
As of June 30, 2006, advisors totaled 12,372, up 2 percent from the year-ago quarter. There was no significant change in the number of branded advisors, primarily due to fewer new hires in the employee channel. Franchisee retention remained strong at 91 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Productivity increases were also the result of growth in mass affluent clients, those with $100,000 or more in assets or comparable product values with the Company, up 8 percent from the year-ago period.
 -

Certificate and fixed annuity net outflows were $1.3 billion, as the Company managed its exposure to the yield curve.
 - 
                 
 
At June 30, 2006, owned, managed and administered assets were $428 billion, reflecting a $17 billion decline in administered assets resulting from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business. Owned and managed assets of $365 billion increased 8 percent from June 30, 2005.
 - 
                 
 
Life insurance in-force was up 9 percent year-over-year to $167 billion.

After nine months as an independent company, separation activities continue to be well executed and on track, with continued improvement in Ameriprise Financial brand awareness.
 - 
                 
 
 
For this non-GAAP presentation of separation costs, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%, adjusted for permanent differences, if any.

Second Quarter 2006 Consolidated Results
 
The Asset Accumulation and Income (AA&I) segment contributed 73 percent of the quarter's $2.1 billion of consolidated revenues, the Protection segment contributed 24 percent of the consolidated revenues and the Corporate and Other and Eliminations (Corporate) segment contributed 3 percent.
 
Revenues
 
AA&I segment revenues of $1.5 billion grew 13 percent, or $169 million, from the year-ago quarter. Management, financial advice and service fees increased $100 million, primarily as a result of strong net flows into wrap and RiverSource variable annuity products, as well as market appreciation. Distribution fees also increased $36 million as a result of strong brokerage and advisor activity levels. Net investment income declined $57 million as realized net investment gains declined $31 million, the income recognized from certain hedges declined $15 million and certificate and fixed annuity balances declined. These decreases were partially offset by increased income from hedge fund investments. "Other" revenues increased $90 million, including $66 million in proceeds from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
On a product level, Brokerage, banking and other revenue grew 32 percent, or $116 million, to $474 million, primarily due to increases in wrap account values; Asset management revenue grew 23 percent, or $82 million, to $441 million, primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business; Variable annuity revenues grew 10 percent, or $21 million, to $235 million, due to strong net inflows into variable annuity products; and Fixed annuity and certificate revenues declined 13 percent, or $50 million, primarily due to lower account balances.
 
Protection segment revenues were down 5 percent. Adjusted Protection segment revenues of $496 million were up 11 percent, or $49 million, from the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of AMEX Assurance. Adjusted growth was primarily due to a $20 million increase in premiums, primarily in Auto and Home, and a $24 million increase in adjusted "Other" revenues, including $18 million from recognizing previously deferred cost of insurance revenues.
 
On a product level, VUL/UL revenues were up 18 percent, or $30 million, to $198 million, primarily driven by the previously mentioned recognition of the deferred cost of insurance revenues and increased sales; Auto and home revenues grew 17 percent, or $22 million, to $150 million, due to increased premium revenues and higher net investment income; Disability income, long term care and other revenues declined 2 percent, or $2 million, to $126 million, reflecting lower net investment income, partially offset by higher premiums.
 
Expenses
 
Consolidated expenses totaled $1.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2006. Adjusted expenses were up 11 percent or $172 million from a year ago. The increase in adjusted expenses was primarily driven by a $116 million increase in compensation and benefits. Adjusted field compensation and benefits contributed $66 million of the increase due to growth in business activity. Adjusted non-field compensation and benefits contributed $50 million of the increase, primarily due to ongoing costs associated with being an independent company, $11 million in severance, primarily related to ongoing reengineering initiatives and $16 million in severance and other costs related to the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business. Interest credited to account values decreased $21 million, primarily due to lower account balances. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) increased $19 million. Adjusted amortization of DAC increased $28 million, as a result of a $28 million adjustment to
DAC balances in Auto and Home. "Other" expenses increased $26 million. Adjusted "other" expenses increased $33 million, including $14 million in costs related to the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
Non-recurring separation costs incurred during the quarter of $84 million pretax ($54 million after-tax) compares to $56 million pretax ($37 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2005. From the announcement of the separation from American Express through quarter end, cumulative non-recurring separation costs totaled $444 million pretax ($289 million after-tax).
 
Pretax Income
 
Consolidated pretax income for the quarter was $186 million. Adjusted pretax income of $270 million was up 30 percent, or $62 million, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a $51 million increase in the AA&I segment and a $10 million decrease in losses in the Corporate segment. Results in the Protection segment were essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter.
 
The AA&I segment pretax income of $222 million includes $6 million of realized net investment gains and a $36 million net gain from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business, substantially offset by $32 million in legal and regulatory costs. The year-ago period included $37 million in realized net investment gains and $34 million in legal and regulatory costs.
 
The Protection segment pretax income of $92 million reflects the benefit from $28 million in reserve and balance sheet adjustments, offset by a $28 million expense from a DAC adjustment in Auto and Home. The year-ago period included $7 million in realized net investment gains.
 
The Corporate segment includes $11 million in severance costs primarily related to ongoing reengineering initiatives. The year-ago period included $13 million in realized net investment gains.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 27.8 percent compared to 23.1 percent for the second quarter of 2005. Included in the second quarter of 2005 was a $3 million benefit related to an IRS audit of previous years' tax returns.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
The Company issued $500 million of junior subordinated notes during the quarter. These securities mature in 60 years, carry a fixed rate coupon of 7.518 percent for the first 10 years and receive at least 75 percent equity credit by the majority of the Company's rating agencies.
 
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1 million shares for approximately $42 million. The quarter-end basic share count was 245.5 million and the ending diluted share count was 247.1 million. Average diluted share count for the quarter was 248.0 million compared to 253.5 million for the first quarter of 2006.
 
Shareholders' equity as of second quarter 2006 was $7.2 billion, up $0.2 billion, or 3 percent, from June 30, 2005 and down $106 million from March 31, 2006. The change from March 31, 2006 was primarily driven by an increase in unrealized losses resulting from the impact of rising interest rates on the Company's owned fixed income investment portfolio. Book value per outstanding share was $29.65 as of June 30, 2006.
The Company maintained substantial liquidity with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2006. The quality of the investment portfolio remained high with 7 percent of the fixed income portfolio in below investment grade securities. Unrealized net investment losses in the Availablefor-Sale Investment portfolio increased to $1.0 billion from $0.6 billion as of March 31, 2006.
fixed charges was 5.8 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 7.0 times.
The debt to capital ratio as of June 30, 2006 was 25.1 percent. Assuming 75 percent equity credit for the junior subordinated notes, the debt to capital ratio was 17.6 percent. At June 30, 2006 the ratio of earnings to

Asset Accumulation and Income Segment  Second Quarter 2006 Results
 
Pretax segment income was $222 million for the second quarter, up 30 percent from $171 million in the second quarter of 2005. Solid results primarily reflect positive net flows in variable annuities and advisor managed accounts, as well as equity market appreciation. The positive impact of the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business, which added a net $36 million to the pretax earnings of this segment, was offset by a $31 million decline in realized net investment gains. The underlying business performance includes an 8 percent increase in managed assets and strong advisor productivity, reflected in a 16 percent increase in segment GDC and a 14 percent increase in distribution fees. Partially offsetting this strong performance was a $57 million decline in net investment income, comprised of a $31 million decline in realized net investment gains, a $15 million decline in the income recognized from certain hedges and lower certificate and fixed annuity balances, offset in part by increased income from hedge fund investments.
Segment Highlights
 
During the quarter the Company closed the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business, realizing a net pretax gain of $36 million.

Wrap product net flows of $2.7 billion in the quarter resulted in total ending assets of $66.5 billion, up 36 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, and was comprised of $56.7 billion in Ameriprise wrap assets and $9.8 billion in Securities America wrap assets.
 - 
                 
 
The quarter reflected strong growth in RiverSource variable annuities with sales up 56 percent from the prior year period, which contributed to a 24 percent increase in ending balances from the same period last year. Ending annuity fixed account balances decreased 7 percent, or $1.9 billion, compared to the prior year period.

Total RiverSource mutual fund assets under management of $56.8 billion decreased $2.0 billion from the first quarter of 2006, reflecting continued, though improving, net outflows in addition to equity market depreciation. Sales in the advisor channel increased to $2.7 billion, up from $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2006, while redemptions dropped to $3.7 billion from $4.7 billion in the first quarter of 2006.

The hedge related losses were primarily offset in the Interest Credited to Account Values and Benefits, Claims, Losses and Settlement expense line items where applicable. In addition, declining fixed annuity and certificate account balances negatively impacted net investment income and were partially offset by higher income from hedge fund investments.

Current business activities in this segment reflect financial planning fees and associated compensation.
 
Pretax segment loss was $128 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared to a pretax loss of $110 million in the year-ago quarter.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). This report includes information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of the separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs. These non-GAAP financial measures, which management views as important indicators of financial performance, include:
 
Consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs;
 - 
 
Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance;
 - 
 
Total expenses before separation costs;
 - 
 
Adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
 
Adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance) and separation costs;
 - 
 
Adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
 
Income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs;
 - 
 
Income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs;
 -

Adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 -

 - 
 
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents a debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt of a CDO consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R and non-recourse debt of property fund limited partnerships managed by Threadneedle consolidated in accordance with EITF 04-5. Management believes that the debt to capital ratio excluding this non-recourse debt better represents the Company's capital structure.

When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.

International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
