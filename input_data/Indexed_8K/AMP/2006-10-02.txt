Item 5.02               Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
On September 28, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") elected Warren D. Knowlton as a non-employee member of the Board by means of increasing the size of the Board by one directorship in Class II (term expiring at the 2007 annual shareholder meeting) and designating Mr. Knowlton through the Board's power to fill newly created directorships.
As contemplated by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") applicable to Form 8-K, the Company believes that neither Mr. Knowlton nor any member of his immediate family has or will have any material interest in any transaction with the Company or any of its subsidiaries as would require disclosure pursuant to SEC Regul ation S-K 404(a). The Company has commenced procedures to determine whether any such interest exists and, if it determines or information becomes available that Mr. Knowlton or any member of his immediate family has or will have such a material interest, it will provide disclosure on a Form 8-K within the applicable time period permitted by the SEC.
