Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
                                            
 
On October 24, 2006, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2006. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2006.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance Company ("AMEX Assurance") and non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs; Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs); adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before discontinued operations and separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts better reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of nonrecourse debt of a collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and nonrecourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this nonrecourse debt better represent our capital structure. In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes we issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  October 24, 2006 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $174 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 versus net income of $125 million and income before discontinued operations of $123 million for the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 29 percent to $231 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the third quarter of 2005. Adjusted earnings exclude income from discontinued operations, after-tax non-recurring separation costs and after-tax earnings in the 2005 period of AMEX Assurance, which remained with American Express.
(1)
 
Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2006 was $0.71. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2006 were $0.94, up 29 percent from the year-ago period. Both per share amounts are based on an average diluted share count of 246 million.
 
Revenues grew 6 percent to $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2006. Adjusted revenues, which exclude the impact of AMEX Assurance in the 2005 period, grew 5 percent and include the impact of the sale of the Company's defined contribution recordkeeping business, which reduced revenues by 1 percent. Growth reflected fundamental improvement in asset-based fees and premiums, partially offset by declines in net investment income.
 
Return on equity for the 12 months ended September 30, 2006 was 7.6 percent. Adjusted return on equity increased to 11.2 percent compared to 10.4 percent for the comparable period last year. During the quarter, the Company repurchased more than 2.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $106 million.
 
"After our first year as an independent, public company, our business continues to show strong, positive momentum," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.
 
"We successfully maintained our focus on executing against our strategic objectives, while effectively managing our separation. We continued to build the Ameriprise Financial brand, grew our mass affluent client base and improved the productivity of the advisor force. This focus led to growth in cash sales and increased client assets primarily driven by strong net inflows into wrap accounts and variable annuities. Importantly, we've invested in our infrastructure and strengthened our platform for growth."

Third Quarter 2006 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude discontinued operations, non-recurring separation costs and AMEX Assurance. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in the Company's annual report and Form 10-K for year-end 2005, filed March 8, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
 
# Variance of 100% or greater.
Included in consolidated net income and adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were $14 million in pretax realized net investment gains and a $20 million pretax loss on a single externally-managed hedge fund investment. This compared to $6 million in pretax net investment losses in the third quarter of 2005.
 
As part of its annual detailed review of deferred acquisition cost (DAC) valuation assumptions (DAC unlocking), the Company reported a $25 million pretax benefit in the third quarter of 2006 compared to a $67 million pretax benefit in the third quarter of 2005.
Third Quarter 2006 Consolidated Operating Highlights
 
The Company continues to successfully execute its strategy of acquiring mass affluent clients, with the number of mass affluent client groups increasing 7 percent from the year-ago period. This increase helped drive average client assets for all branded advisor client groups to $91,600 compared to $83,300 in the year-ago period.
 - 
                 
 
Financial planning penetration of newly acquired mass affluent client groups was 59 percent year-to-date. Overall, client financial plan penetration ended the period at 44 percent compared to 43 percent in the prior year.
 - 
                 
 
Strong advisor productivity increases drove 14 percent growth in total Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) from the year-ago period, primarily driven by a 31 percent increase in wrap account balances.
 - 
                 
 
During the quarter, the number of branded advisors increased by 79 to 10,634, up 1 percent year-over-year, with total advisors up 2 percent year-over-year to 12,427. This change to positive quarterly net gain in the branded advisor channel was primarily driven by improving employee and franchisee advisor retention, with franchisee advisor retention reaching pre-separation levels of 93 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Owned, managed and administered assets were $440 billion at September 30, 2006 with year-over-year growth of 5 percent. This reflected the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business in the second quarter of 2006, which resulted in the transfer of $17 billion in administered assets and lowered year-over-year reported growth by 4 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Strong net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities continued with $1.8 billion in wrap net inflows and $1.4 billion in RiverSource annuity variable account net inflows.
 - 
                 
 
RiverSource mutual fund net outflows narrowed, declining to $0.8 billion compared to net outflows of $2.7 billion in the prior-year period. This improvement was driven by both increased sales and lower redemption rates in the branded advisor channel.
 - 
                 
 
Certificate and annuity fixed account net outflows of $1.3 billion reflected the Company's strategy to focus on products that both meet client needs and offer a more attractive return on capital. This decline in account balances lowered related capital requirements in the quarter.
 - 
                 
 
The Company launched Ameriprise Bank, FSB and new home lending products establishing a new capability for serving clients' borrowing, cash management and personal trust needs.
 - 
                 
 
Life insurance in-force was up 9 percent year-over-year to $171 billion.
 - 
                 
 
The Company continues to achieve targeted reengineering savings with a substantial portion applied to fund a significant investment agenda for growth.
 - 
                 
 
The Company delivered strong operating results while simultaneously accomplishing its separation objectives. With the majority of these objectives completed, the separation process continues to be well executed and on track.

For this non-GAAP presentation of separation costs, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%, adjusted for permanent differences, if any.

Third Quarter 2006 Consolidated Results
 
Income before discontinued operations grew 41 percent to $174 million. Adjusted earnings grew 29 percent to $231 million, with adjusted pretax income up 13 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. The pretax benefit from DAC unlocking in the third quarter of 2006 was $25 million, compared to a benefit of $67 million in the prior-year period.
 
Profits in the quarter were positively impacted by the Company's efforts to gather assets and grow revenues from higher margin, less capital-intensive products, reflected in strong net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities. Market appreciation also favorably impacted results.
 
These positives were partially offset by the impact of lower account balances and spread compression in the fixed annuity and certificate businesses in the Asset Accumulation and Income (AA&I) segment, increased accruals for management incentives in recognition of year-to-date performance, primarily in the AA&I segment, and increased interest expense from establishing an independent capital structure, reflected in the Corporate and Other segment.
 
Revenues
 
Consolidated revenues rose 6 percent to $2.0 billion. Adjusted revenues grew 5 percent. This growth reflected continued strong flows in wrap accounts and variable annuities, as well as market appreciation. These positives were offset by lower management fees due to the impact of the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business in the second quarter of 2006 and lower net investment income due to lower account balances in the fixed annuity and certificate businesses. In addition, revenues were impacted by lower distribution fees due to a shift from sales of loaded mutual funds to sales of load-waived mutual funds within wrap accounts. This shift is driven by clients migrating from transaction-based fee arrangements to asset-based fee arrangements, where the asset-based fees are paid over time.
 
The Company will recognize Threadneedle annual hedge fund performance fees earned in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 5 percent to $720 million. Underlying year-over-year growth was driven by 31 percent growth in wrap assets and 24 percent growth in annuity variable account assets. These increases were partially offset by $16 million in lower fees due to the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business. In addition, the third quarter of 2005 included $28 million in Threadneedle hedge fund performance fees.  Combined, these two items lowered the growth rate by more than 6 percent.
 
Distribution fees grew 1 percent to $300 million. Underlying business activity was strong, with total cash sales up 9 percent. This was offset by the impact of a mix shift from sales of loaded mutual funds to sales of load-waived mutual funds within wrap accounts.
 
declined 3 percent to $542 million. This reflected the ongoing trend of declining assets supporting the fixed annuity and certificate businesses. In total, changes in realized net investment gains, investment income from hedges related to stock market certificates, equity index annuities, Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) annuities, and other investment income had no impact on the year-over-year decline. In addition, in accordance with EITF 04-5 beginning in 2006, the current quarter included a benefit from the consolidation of certain hedge funds managed by RiverSource Investments.
Net investment income
 
Premiums grew 21 percent to $244 million. Adjusted premiums grew 12 percent. The increase was favorably impacted by a $15 million adjustment in premiums resulting from a review of the long term care (LTC) reinsurance arrangement during the third quarter of 2006. In addition to the
LTC premiums, adjusted growth was driven by a continued increase in policy counts in Auto and Home.
 
Other revenues grew 35 percent to $171 million. Adjusted other revenues grew 34 percent, with the current quarter impacted by the consolidation of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by Threadneedle in accordance with EITF 04-5. In addition, this increase was driven by growth in variable annuity rider fees and cost of insurance for variable universal life and universal life (VUL/UL) products.
 
Expenses
 
Compensation and benefits  Field increased 5 percent to $428 million. The reported expenses in this line in the third quarter of 2005 included $35 million in ceding commissions paid to American Express. Adjusted Compensation and benefits  Field increased 15 percent. This increase was primarily the result of overall business growth as reflected by the 14 percent growth in GDC. The shift from loaded mutual funds to load-waived mutual funds within wrap accounts also impacted field compensation, as transaction-based compensation paid in the current period was replaced by asset-based compensation paid over time.
 
Compensation and benefits  Non-field increased 11 percent to $328 million. This increase reflects higher costs related to operating as an independent company and increased accruals in the quarter for annual management incentives in recognition of year-to-date performance and in recognition of strong investment management performance. Cost containment initiatives resulted in flat base salary and benefits on a sequential basis, excluding severance costs recognized in the second quarter of 2006, and a flat non-field employee count.
 
Interest credited to account values decreased 6 percent to $317 million, reflecting continued declines in fixed annuity and certificates account balances. The impact of declining balances was partially offset by increased certificate crediting rates, reflecting higher short-term interest rates. Stock market appreciation also increased the crediting rates for stock market certificates and equity indexed annuities. These equity market-driven expense increases are hedged, resulting in correlated increases in net investment income for the third quarter of 2006.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 23 percent to $233 million. On an adjusted basis, expenses declined 3 percent. In the third quarter of 2006, these expenses included $12 million related to DAC unlocking. In the third quarter of 2005, these expenses reflected the addition of $13 million to LTC maintenance expense reserves and the assumption of $9 million in E&O reserves from AMEX Assurance. Underlying growth was primarily driven by exposure growth in Auto and Home.
 
DAC expenses increased 78 percent to $87 million, reflecting the impact of DAC unlocking in the third quarter of both periods. DAC unlocking had a $38 million favorable impact on DAC expenses in the third quarter of 2006 and a favorable $67 million impact in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of the DAC unlocking in both years, year-over-year expense growth was driven by underlying business growth.
 
The net third quarter 2006 pretax benefit from the change in DAC valuation assumptions was $25 million, comprised of a $38 million benefit in the DAC amortization expense line, a $12 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses and a $1 million decrease in other revenues. This net benefit primarily reflected a $25 million benefit from modeling increased product persistency and a $15 million benefit from modeling improvements in mortality, offset by negative impacts of $8 million from modeling lower variable product fund fee revenue and $8 million from model changes related to Variable Life Second to Die insurance.
Interest and debt expense increased from $16 million to $32 million, as the Company established its long-term independent corporate capital structure. The Company replaced short-term debt with fixed rate, medium-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 and issued junior subordinated notes (hybrid securities) in the second quarter of 2006.
 
Other expenses were down 19 percent to $248 million. Adjusted other expenses declined 18 percent. This decrease was primarily due to higher legal costs in the third quarter of 2005. In 2006, other expenses included expenses consolidated under EITF 04-5 related to certain property fund limited partnerships managed by Threadneedle and certain hedge funds managed by RiverSource. The remaining components of this expense line were down 10 percent, reflecting management's continuing commitment to tightly manage costs.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income before discontinued operations was 19.8 percent, down from 32.0 percent in the third quarter of 2005. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 24.0 percent, down from 33.7 percent in the third quarter of 2005. Included in the third quarter of 2006 was a $13 million tax benefit related to the finalization of prior-period tax returns. Included in the third quarter of 2005 was a $13 million increase in tax expense related to the finalization of prior-period tax returns.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
During the third quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares for approximately $106 million. The quarter-end basic share count was 243.5 million and the ending diluted share count was 245.8 million. The average diluted share count for the quarter was 246.4 million.
 
Shareholders' equity as of third quarter 2006 was $7.8 billion, essentially flat compared to the prior-year period as retained earnings were offset by $422 million in share repurchases and a $206 million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to the impact of rising interest rates on the Company's fixed income investment portfolio. Book value per outstanding share was $32.02 as of September 30, 2006.
 
The Company remains committed to maintaining the safety and soundness of its balance sheet, continuing to maintain substantial liquidity and a high quality investment portfolio, and continuing to actively manage and mitigate risk exposures.
 
Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.2 billion in the quarter to $3.3 billion, primarily as a result of establishing Ameriprise Bank, FSB. Liabilities related to these bank assets are now reported in the customer deposits liability line along with certificate reserves.
 - 
                 
 
The quality of the investment portfolio remained high with 7 percent of the fixed income portfolio in below investment grade securities. As part of its capital optimization program, the Company has been strategically liquidating externally managed hedge funds, with the September 30, 2006 market value of approximately $130 million, down 67 percent since separation.
 - 
                 
 
Unrealized net investment losses in the Available-for-Sale investment portfolio were $0.4 billion at quarter end.
 - 
                 
The Company continued to purchase long-dated customized put options designed to closely match the options sold to customers as variable annuity GMWB riders. This primarily static hedging program continues to perform within expected ranges, mitigating tail risk and earnings volatility.
 - 
                 
 
The debt to capital ratio as of September 30, 2006 was 22.5 percent. The debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 16.7 percent. For the third quarter of 2006 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.1 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 7.0 times.

Asset Accumulation and Income Segment  Third Quarter 2006 Results
 
Pretax segment income increased $8 million, or 4 percent, to $192 million for the third quarter. Strong underlying growth was driven primarily by broker-dealer activities, offset by significant declines in income generated by fixed annuity and certificate products.
 
Total revenues increased $39 million, or 3 percent, to $1.4 billion, reflecting strong broker-dealer activity, continued growth in fee-based assets related to wrap account and variable annuity inflows, as well as market appreciation. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business in the second quarter of 2006. Growth was also impacted by a $37 million year-over-year decline in net investment income, reflecting lower annuity related investment income, primarily as a result of declining account balances and the allocation to this segment of $15 million of the previously mentioned externally-managed hedge fund loss. In addition, net investment income included $12 million in income from the consolidation of certain hedge funds managed by RiverSource in accordance with EITF 04-5.
 
Total expenses increased $31 million, or 3 percent, to $1.2 billion, primarily due to a $39 million increase in field compensation related to business growth and an increase of $29 million in DAC amortization expenses including the impact of DAC unlocking in the third quarter of both periods. A substantial decline in year-over-year legal and regulatory expenses was partially offset by increased accruals in the quarter for higher estimated performance-based compensation in recognition of year-to-date performance and in recognition of strong investment management performance, as well as the year-over-year impact of DAC unlocking.
Segment Highlights
 
Total managed assets of $283.4 billion were up 9 percent from the prior-year period.
 - 
                 
 
Wrap product net inflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter resulted in total ending assets of  $70.1 billion, up 31 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Total RiverSource mutual fund outflows declined to $0.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the prior-year period and $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2006. Management believes the year-over-year sales growth of 48 percent and year-to-date sales growth of 33 percent reflect client and advisor recognition of RiverSource investment performance and strong client and advisor adoption of new solution-based products.
 - 
                 
 
Investment performance at RiverSource Investments and Threadneedle Investments remained strong.
 - 
                 
 
One of the Company's larger Defined Contribution Investment Management Only clients announced plans to change investment options in the 401(k) plan they sponsor. While this did not impact flows in the quarter, management believes this will result in related net outflows for this account of approximately $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, primarily in mutual funds.
 - 
                 
 
Growth in total managed institutional assets of 6 percent to $134.9 billion reflected year-to-date inflows of $4.2 billion including foreign exchange impact and market appreciation.
 - 
                 
 
Threadneedle experienced net outflows as continued positive net inflows in targeted growth areas were offset by larger outflows of lower margin Zurich assets.
 - 
                 
 
Cash sales through third party distributors increased 60 percent compared to the prior-year period, reflecting strong variable annuity sales. The Company added nine distribution partners to distribute RiverSource Annuities, bringing the total to 82. The Company established the operational infrastructure necessary to offer RiverSource Funds on third party platforms.
 -

 - 
                 
 
RiverSource annuity fixed account net outflows of $1.0 billion resulted in $24.0 billion in ending balances, down 9 percent from the prior-year period. The tax equivalent spread declined to 1.65 percent from 2.19 percent in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of lower hedge-fund related investment income. The year-to-date spread of 2.02 percent is down slightly from 2.09 percent from the comparable prior-year period.
 - 
                 
 
Certificate net outflows of $0.3 billion resulted in $4.6 billion in ending balances, down 28 percent from the prior-year period. The tax equivalent spread declined to 1.00 percent from 1.48 percent in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher interest crediting rates reflecting increased short-term interest rates.
 -

Protection Segment  Third Quarter 2006 Results
 
Adjusted financial information excludes AMEX Assurance from prior periods.
 
Pretax segment income was up 14 percent to $151 million for the third quarter of 2006. Adjusted pretax segment income rose 17 percent driven by profitability improvements across all product lines.

This increase included a $15 million adjustment in premiums resulting from a review of the LTC reinsurance arrangement during the third quarter of 2006. The remaining growth was primarily driven by a 12 percent increase in revenues from Auto and Home.
 
Expenses grew 11 percent to $347 million. Adjusted expenses grew 5 percent, or $18 million, reflecting underlying business growth. While adjusted expenses in the third quarters of both 2006 and 2005 reflected a number of disclosed items, in total these items were substantially equal in amount and direction for each period. As a result, these items did not materially impact adjusted expense trends or adjusted pretax income trends for this segment.

Corporate and Other and Eliminations Segment  Third Quarter 2006 Results
 
This segment primarily reflects financial planning fees and associated compensation, unallocated corporate expenses and interest expenses on debt considered part of the corporate capital structure.
 
The pretax segment loss was $126 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared to a pretax loss of $135 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring separation costs, the segment incurred an operating loss of $39 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $43 million in the prior-year period.
 
An $18 million improvement in net investment income reflected higher investment asset balances due to the capital contribution from American Express at the end of the third quarter of 2005 and the issuance of hybrid securities during the second quarter of 2006. This increase in revenues was primarily offset by higher interest and debt expense associated with establishing the Company's long-term corporate capital structure.
 
Management believes separation activities continue to be well-executed and on track. Separation costs incurred in the quarter were $87 million, the largest component of which related to reestablishing the Company's technology infrastructure. Since separation, the Company has incurred $531 million in non-recurring separation costs.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  This report includes information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of the separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs.  These non-GAAP financial measures, which management views as important indicators of financial performance, include: 
 
 - 
Consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs;
 - 
Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance;
 - 
Total expenses before separation costs;
 - 
Adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
Adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance) and separation costs;
 - 
Adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
Income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs;

 - 
Adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);

Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts better reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.  These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents a debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt of a CDO consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R) and non-recourse debt of property fund limited partnerships managed by Threadneedle consolidated in accordance with EITF 04-5. Management believes that the debt to capital ratio excluding this non-recourse debt better represents the Company's capital structure.

Fund Performance & Lipper Ranking
As of September 30, 2006
Source of Data:  Lipper
 
Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges.  Net asset value ("NAV") returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.  RiverSource S&P 500 IndexFund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes.  Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.

The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies involve substantial risk. Historically, these stocks have experienced greater price volatility than stocks of larger companies, and they can be expected to do so in the future.
 
Stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be slightly less volatile than those of small-capitalization companies but still involve substantial risk.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may under perform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
