Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
              
 
On January 25, 2007, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2006. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2006.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance Company ("AMEX Assurance") and non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs; Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs); adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before discontinued operations and separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of nonrecourse debt of a collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and nonrecourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this nonrecourse debt better represent our capital structure. In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes we issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  January 25, 2007  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $171 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 54 percent from net income of $111 million for the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 30 percent to $251 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Adjusted earnings for the quarters exclude after-tax non-recurring separation costs.
(1)
 
Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $0.69, an increase of 57 percent from the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $1.02, an increase of 32 percent from the year-ago period. The weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 246.3 million, down from 250.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Revenues grew 16 percent to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Growth reflected fundamental improvement in asset-based fees, distribution fees and premiums as a result of increasing advisor productivity and market appreciation. Growth was partially offset by continued declines in net investment income, primarily as a result of declining balances in annuity fixed accounts and certificates.
 
Return on equity for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 8.3 percent. Adjusted return on equity increased to 11.8 percent compared to 10.2 percent for 2005. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 921,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $48 million.
 
For the full year, income before discontinued operations grew 13 percent to $631 million, and adjusted earnings grew 25 percent to $866 million compared to 2005. Income before discontinued operations per diluted share for 2006 was $2.54, an increase of 12 percent from the prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2006 were $3.48, an increase of 24 percent from a year ago. Revenues grew 9 percent, or $656 million. Adjusted revenues grew 11 percent, or $794 million, to $8.1 billion.
 
"This was a strong quarter for Ameriprise Financial, and it was a fitting conclusion to a highly successful first year as a public company," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.
 
"We are generating positive momentum in our business metrics as we continue to establish Ameriprise Financial as a financial services leader. Growth in owned, managed and administered assets, mass affluent and affluent clients, financial plans and cash sales all accelerated in the fourth quarter. We increased our branded advisor count and substantially increased productivity. As a result, we've seen solid financial performance in our fourth quarter and full year results as revenue and earnings growth met or exceeded our target ranges and adjusted return on equity increased to within 20 basis points of our near-term goal.
 
"In addition, we're on track to complete all activities required to fully separate from American Express later this year, with the majority of the work already behind us."
 
Fourth Quarter 2006 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude discontinued operations and AMEX Assurance from the full year 2005 period and non-recurring separation costs from all periods. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for year-end 2005, filed March 8, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Included in consolidated net income and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $27 million in pretax realized net investment gains primarily related to recoveries on WorldCom securities. This compared to $5 million in pretax net investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Fourth Quarter 2006 Consolidated Operating Highlights
 
Mass affluent and affluent client groups increased 10 percent from the year-ago period.
 - 
                 
 
Advice sales were up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Overall, client financial plan penetration ended the quarter at 45 percent compared to 44 percent in the prior year period, with planning penetration of newly acquired mass affluent and affluent clients substantially higher.
 - 
                 
 
Strong advisor productivity increases drove 27 percent growth in total Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) from the year-ago period, primarily driven by strong equity markets, continued strength in wrap account net inflows and strong growth in sales of direct investments.
 - 
                 
 
During the quarter, the number of branded advisors increased by 195 to 10,829, up 2 percent year-over-year, with total advisors up 1 percent year-over-year to 12,592.  Franchisee advisor retention remained strong at 93 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Owned, managed and administered assets were $466 billion at December 31, 2006 with year-over-year growth of 9 percent, primarily as a result of strong equity markets. This also reflected the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business in the second quarter of 2006, which resulted in the transfer of $17 billion in administered assets and lowered year-over-year reported growth by 4 percentage points.
 - 
                 
 
Strong net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities continued with $1.6 billion in wrap net inflows and $1.5 billion in annuity variable account net inflows.
 - 
                 
 
RiverSource Investments and Threadneedle Investments delivered consistent, competitive investment performance across equity, fixed income and alternative portfolios.
 - 
                 
 
RiverSource mutual fund net outflows of $1.5 billion included $0.7 billion of the previously disclosed $0.8 billion outflow related to American Express repositioning its 401(k) offerings. Excluding this single event, net flows continued to improve primarily due to 35 percent growth in sales and lower redemptions in the branded advisor channel.
 - 
                 
SM
 
Annuity fixed account net outflows of $1.1 billion reflected the current interest rate environment and the Company's strategy to focus on products that offer a more attractive return on capital.
 - 
                 
 
Life insurance in-force increased 9 percent year-over-year to $174 billion.
 - 
                 
 
On December 31, 2006, the Company consolidated its five life insurance entities into two and renamed them RiverSource Life Insurance Company and RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York.
 - 
                 
 
The Company exceeded its full-year reengineering target and applied a majority of the savings to investments for longer-term growth.
 - 
                 
 
Separation remains well executed, on budget and on track for completion by September 30, 2007. The Company expects to incur non-recurring separation costs through the end of the year.
 - 
                 
 
Fourth Quarter 2006 Consolidated Results
 
Net income grew 54 percent to $171 million. Adjusted earnings grew 30 percent to $251 million, with adjusted pretax income up 29 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
 
Results were positively impacted by the Company's efforts to gather assets and grow revenues from higher-returning, less capital-intensive products, reflected in strong net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities. Market appreciation also favorably impacted results.
 
These positives were partially offset by the impact of lower spread income in the fixed annuity and certificate businesses in the Asset Accumulation and Income (AA&I) segment, higher expenses related to legal and regulatory items in the AA&I segment, and increased interest expense from establishing an independent capital structure, reflected in the Corporate and Other segment.
 
Revenues
 
Consolidated revenues rose 16 percent to $2.2 billion. Growth reflected strong sales of direct investments, continued strong net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities, as well as market appreciation. These positives were partially offset by lower net investment income due to declining annuity fixed account and certificate balances.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 25 percent, or $163 million, to $814 million. Underlying year-over-year growth was driven by 32 percent growth in wrap assets and 31 percent growth in annuity variable account assets. In the quarter, the Company recognized $46 million in Threadneedle hedge fund performance fees for the full year's performance, which compared to a $12 million reduction in revenue as a result of hedge fund performance in the fourth quarter of 2005. These increases were partially offset by $15 million in lower fee revenue due to the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
Distribution fees grew 35 percent, or $97 million, to $374 million. Underlying business activity was strong, with total cash sales up 22 percent. In the quarter, sales of direct investments far exceeded historical trends due to client reinvestment of proceeds from certain real estate investment trust liquidations.
 
declined 1 percent, or $8 million, to $566 million. Overall, this reflected the ongoing trend of declining assets in the fixed annuity and certificate businesses. Results were positively impacted by realized net investment gains of $27 million, primarily related to recoveries on WorldCom securities, compared to $5 million in net investment gains in the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by a $9 million loss in net investment income from the consolidation, in accordance with EITF 04-5, of certain limited partnerships holding client assets we manage.
Net investment income
 
Premiums grew 5 percent, or $11 million, to $239 million, primarily driven by a 9 percent increase in policy counts in Auto and Home.
 
Other revenues grew 21 percent, or $29 million, to $168 million, primarily due to the consolidation of certain limited partnerships holding client assets we manage, in accordance with EITF 04-5, and growth in variable annuity rider fees.
Expenses
 
Compensation and benefits  Field increased 28 percent, or $104 million, to $478 million. This increase was primarily the result of overall business growth as reflected by the 27 percent growth in GDC.
 
Compensation and benefits  Non-field increased 33 percent, or $93 million, to $374 million. This reflected a $42 million increase specifically related to Threadneedle hedge fund performance compensation for the full year, as well as higher costs related to corporate and other investment management incentives in recognition of strong performance.
 
Interest credited to account values decreased 5 percent, or $18 million, to $316 million, reflecting continued declines in annuity fixed account and certificate balances, partially offset by increased crediting rates on certificates. Stock market appreciation also increased the crediting rates for stock market certificates and equity indexed annuities. These equity market-driven expense increases are hedged, resulting in correlated increases in net investment income.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 5 percent, or $11 million, to $245 million, primarily reflecting higher life and health insurance benefits. In the fourth quarter of 2006, volume-driven increases in Auto and Home benefits were offset by a net release of $9 million in reserves, primarily reflecting continued improvement in the 2004 and 2005 accident year results.
 
Amortization of deferred acquisition cost (DAC) expenses decreased 7 percent, or $8 million, to $104 million. Volume-driven increases in variable annuity DAC amortization were more than offset by the favorable impact of equity market appreciation.
 
Interest and debt expense increased 57 percent, or $12 million, to $33 million, reflecting costs associated with the Company establishing its long-term independent corporate capital structure. The Company replaced short-term debt with fixed rate, medium-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 and issued junior subordinated notes (hybrid securities) in the second quarter of 2006.
 
Other expenses increased 9 percent, or $24 million, to $285 million, reflecting $31 million in expenses related to legal and regulatory items in the current quarter, partially offset by corporate cost containment initiatives.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income was 15.5 percent for the quarter, as compared to 12.0 percent in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 23.0 percent, down slightly from 23.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2005. Included in net income and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 was a $16 million tax benefit primarily due to a change in the effective state income tax rate applied to deferred tax assets as a result of the Company's separation from American Express.
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased 921,000 shares for approximately $48 million. The quarter-end basic share count was 242.8 million and the ending diluted share count was 246.2 million. The average diluted share count for the quarter was 246.3 million.
 
Shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2006 was $7.9 billion, an increase of $238 million compared to December 31, 2005, as retained earnings were offset by $470 million in share repurchases and a $58 million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to the impact of rising interest rates on the Company's fixed income investment portfolio. Book value per outstanding share was $32.83 as of December 31, 2006.
 
The Company remains committed to maintaining the safety and soundness of its balance sheet, continuing to maintain substantial liquidity and a high quality investment portfolio, and continuing to actively manage and mitigate risk exposures.
 
Cash and cash equivalents were more than $2.7 billion.
 - 
                 
 
The quality of the Available-for-Sale fixed income investment portfolio, representing approximately 30 percent of balance sheet assets, remained high, with 7 percent below investment grade.
 - 
                 
 
Unrealized net investment losses in the Available-for-Sale investment portfolio were $0.3 billion at quarter end.
 - 
                 
 
The Company continued to purchase long-dated customized put options designed to closely match the product features sold to customers as variable annuity Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit riders, hedging equity market, interest rate and volatility risk.
 - 
                 
 
The debt to capital ratio as of December 31, 2006 was 21.9 percent. The debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 16.4 percent. For the fourth quarter of 2006 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.0 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.5 times.

Full Year 2006 Consolidated Results
 
For all of 2006, income before discontinued operations grew 13 percent to $631 million. Adjusted earnings grew 25 percent to $866 million compared to 2005.
 
Income before discontinued operations per share was $2.54, up 12 percent from $2.26 for the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.48, up 24 percent from $2.80 for the prior year. Weighted average diluted shares for full year 2006 were 248.5 million compared to 247.2 million in 2005.
 
Revenues grew 9 percent, or $656 million. Adjusted revenues grew 11 percent, or $794 million, to $8.1 billion. Growth was primarily driven by a 15 percent, or $390 million, increase in management, financial advice and service fees, a $150 million increase in distribution fees and a $202 million increase in other revenues, primarily due to the consolidation of certain limited partnerships, in accordance with EITF 04-5, holding client assets we manage and proceeds from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
Expenses increased 8 percent, or $536 million. Adjusted expenses increased 9 percent, or $592 million, to $7.0 billion. This increase was primarily due to a 19 percent, or $500 million, increase in field and non-field compensation and benefits due to increased business activity, higher performance incentives and costs related to operating as an independent company.

Asset Accumulation and Income Segment  Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
 
Pretax segment income increased 33 percent, or $62 million, to $249 million for the fourth quarter. Strong underlying growth was driven primarily by fee-based businesses.
 
Total revenues increased 18 percent, or $247 million, to $1.6 billion, reflecting strong broker-dealer activity including client reinvestment of proceeds from certain real estate investment trust liquidations and continued growth in asset management fee-based and performance-based revenues, both positively impacted by market appreciation. In the quarter, the Company recognized $46 million in Threadneedle hedge fund performance fees for the full year, which compared to a $12 million reduction in revenue as a result of hedge fund performance in the fourth quarter of 2005. These increases were partially offset by a $9 million loss in net investment income from the consolidation of certain limited partnerships holding client assets we manage, in accordance with EITF 04-5, and $15 million in lower fees due to the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
Total expenses increased 16 percent, or $185 million, to $1.3 billion, primarily due to a $109 million increase in field compensation related to business growth and a $100 million increase in other expenses. This increase in other expenses reflected higher costs related to incentives in recognition of strong management performance, including $33 million specifically related to Threadneedle hedge fund investment performance for the full year, compared to a $9 million reduction in expense in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $30 million in higher expenses related to legal and regulatory items.
Segment Highlights
 
      Total managed assets of $300 billion were up 14 percent from the prior year period.

Fourth quarter net outflows included previously disclosed outflows related to American Express repositioning its 401(k) offerings. Management believes the year-over-year sales growth of 35 percent reflects client and advisor recognition of RiverSource investment performance and strong client and advisor adoption of goal-based products.
 - 
 
      Growth in total managed institutional assets of 13 percent to $143 billion reflected year-to-date net outflows of lower margin Zurich assets, offset by the positive impacts of foreign currency translation and market appreciation.
 -

The tax equivalent spread declined to 0.75 percent from 1.49 percent in the prior year period, primarily due to higher interest crediting rates. The full year spread of 1.12 percent is down substantially from 1.68 percent for 2005.

Expenses increased 1 percent, or $3 million, to $396 million. This included a $10 million increase in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, primarily due to increased life and health related benefits. In the fourth quarter of 2006, volume-driven increases in Auto and Home benefits were offset by a net release of $9 million in reserves, primarily reflecting continued improvement in 2004 and 2005 accident year results.
 
Segment Highlights
 
      Life insurance in-force increased 9 percent to $174 billion.

Corporate and Other and Eliminations Segment  Fourth Quarter 2006 Results
 
This segment primarily reflects financial planning fees and associated compensation, unallocated corporate expenses and interest expense on securities considered part of the corporate capital structure.
 
The pretax segment loss was $152 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to a pretax loss of $138 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring separation costs, the segment incurred an operating loss of $29 million in the quarter compared to a loss of $13 million in the prior year period.
 
A $13 million improvement in net investment income reflected higher investment asset balances due to the issuance of hybrid securities during the second quarter of 2006. This increase in revenues was primarily offset by higher interest and debt expense associated with establishing the Company's long-term corporate capital structure and higher unallocated corporate expenses.
 
Management believes separation activities continue to be well-executed, on-budget and on track. Separation costs incurred in the quarter were $123 million, the largest component of which related to reestablishing the Company's technology infrastructure. Since separation, the Company has incurred $654 million in non-recurring separation costs.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). This report includes information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of the separation from American Express Company, which consist of discontinued operations, AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs. These non-GAAP financial measures, which management views as important indicators of financial performance, include:
 
Consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance and separation costs;
 - 
Protection segment income statements adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance;
 - 
Total expenses before separation costs;
 - 
Adjusted net investment gains (losses), pretax (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
Adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance) and separation costs;
 - 
Adjusted contribution margin (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
Income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs;
 - 
Income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs;
 - 
Income before discontinued operations and separation costs;
 - 
Separation cost, after-tax;
 - 
Adjusted pretax segment income (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance);
 - 
Adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and
 - 
Pretax segment loss before separation costs.
 - 
 
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts better reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents a debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt of a CDO consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R) and non-recourse debt of property fund limited partnerships managed by Threadneedle consolidated in accordance with EITF 04-5. Management believes that the debt to capital ratio excluding this non-recourse debt better represents the Company's capital structure.

Fund Performance & Lipper Ranking
As of December 31, 2006
Source of Data:  Lipper
 
Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges. Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking Since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date. When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit. RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes. Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.
 
The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. The value of your investment and returns will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
 
Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown.

Important Disclosures
 
An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about the funds, call (800) 297-3863, TTY: (800) 846-4852. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
 
The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies often involve greater risks and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may under perform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds, generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments. See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The principal risks of investing in the Fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall; however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much as interest rates in general. Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the Fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance. The floating rate loans and securities in which the Fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
