Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
      
 
On April 24, 2007, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company which consist of non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude separation costs; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude separation costs); income before income tax provision and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income; return on allocated equity adjusted for pretax segment income; and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and nonrecourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this nonrecourse debt better represent our capital structure. In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2007 was $0.68, an increase of 19 percent from the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2007 were $0.90, an increase of 20 percent from the year ago period. Increased profitability was driven by a continued strategic shift to less capital-intensive, fee-based products and greater advisor productivity, partially offset by declines in spread income. Per share profitability was further enhanced by an active share repurchase program. The weighted average diluted share count for the first quarter of 2007 was 244.1 million, down from 253.5 million for the first quarter of 2006.
 
Revenues grew 6 percent to $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2007, primarily reflecting 11 percent growth in management fees and 14 percent growth in distribution fees. Growth was partially offset by continued declines in net investment income, primarily as a result of lower balances in annuity fixed accounts and certificates and lower owned hedge fund investments, as well as the impact of the Company's sale of its defined contribution recordkeeping business in the second quarter of 2006.
 
Return on equity for the 12 months ended March 31, 2007 was 8.6 percent, including separation costs. Adjusted return on equity increased to 12.2 percent from 10.4 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2006.
 
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 5.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $352 million, announced an additional $1 billion share repurchase program and increased its quarterly dividend to $0.15 from $0.11 per share.
 
"The results we reported today clearly demonstrate that the company continues to deliver strong performance," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "We exceeded our goal for adjusted earnings growth for the fifth consecutive quarter. These strong operating results, combined with our active share repurchase program, drove adjusted return on equity into our targeted range ahead of schedule.

"I am particularly pleased with our underlying business momentum. Our advisor force is driving strong productivity gains as we enhance distribution profitability, and we are seeing improvements in overall fee-based asset flows."
 
First Quarter 2007 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude non-recurring separation costs from all periods. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for year-end 2006, filed on February 27, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
 
First Quarter 2007 Consolidated Operating Highlights
 
Mass affluent and affluent client groups increased 8 percent from the year-ago period, with high rates of financial planning penetration for newly acquired clients in this core group.
 - 
                 
 
Strong productivity gains and continued high levels of advisor retention were reflected in 18 percent growth in Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) from the year ago period.
 - 
                 
 
The branded advisor count was flat. Franchisee advisors grew 2 percent from the year-ago period and employee advisors declined 3 percent as a result of the Company's reengineering efforts to improve productivity and distribution economics.
 - 
                 
 
Owned, managed and administered assets were $474 billion at March 31, 2007, up 10 percent from the prior year period when adjusted for the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business, which resulted in the transfer of $17 billion in administered assets. Excluding the adjustment for the sale, growth was 6 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Overall product flows in the quarter were strong including net inflows of $3.0 billion in wrap accounts, $1.4 billion in annuity variable accounts and $0.7 billion in RiverSource institutional funds, offset by net outflows of $1.1 billion in annuity fixed accounts. RiverSource retail funds had net outflows of $0.8 billion, which included $0.3 billion of 401(k) assets. The $0.8 billion in RiverSource retail fund net outflows in the quarter compares to $2.1 billion in net outflows for the same period last year, an improvement of more than 60 percent.
 - 
                 
 
The Company continued to introduce innovative, goal-based solutions with the launch of , a series of discretionary managed accounts that further enhances the Company's leadership in mutual fund wrap products.

First Quarter 2007 Consolidated Results
 
Net income grew 14 percent to $165 million. Adjusted earnings grew 16 percent to $220 million, with adjusted pretax income up 17 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
 
Results were positively impacted by the Company's efforts to gather assets and grow revenues from less capital-intensive, fee-based products, reflected in strong net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities, and improved margins in the Protection segment. Market appreciation also favorably impacted results.
 
These positives were partially offset by the impact of lower spread income in the annuity and certificate businesses within the Asset Accumulation and Income (AA&I) segment.
 
Revenues
 
Consolidated revenues rose 6 percent to $2.1 billion. Adjusting for the $16 million impact from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business, revenues rose 7 percent. Growth reflected continued strong net inflows in wrap accounts and annuity variable accounts, increased sales of direct investments and market appreciation. These positives were partially offset by lower net investment income due to declining annuity fixed account and certificate balances and lower owned hedge fund investments.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 11 percent, or $81 million, to $791 million. The growth was driven by 28 percent growth in wrap assets and 27 percent growth in annuity variable account assets.
 
Distribution fees grew 14 percent, or $43 million, to $344 million. Underlying business activity was strong, with total cash sales up 13 percent. Fee growth primarily resulted from an increase in sales of direct investments and higher brokerage asset balances.
 
declined 10 percent, or $56 million, to $518 million. Overall, this decrease reflected the ongoing trend of declining annuity fixed account and certificate balances as clients are choosing other products in the current interest rate environment. In addition, investment income from owned hedge fund investments declined $26 million from the prior year period, primarily due to the planned liquidation of externally managed hedge funds. This decrease was partially offset by $9 million in net realized investment gains during the first quarter of 2007 compared to $4 million for the first quarter of 2006.
Net investment income
 
Premiums grew 7 percent, or $16 million, to $236 million, primarily driven by an increase in policy counts in Auto and Home.
 
Other revenues grew 21 percent, or $30 million, to $174 million, primarily due to growth in variable annuity rider and cost of insurance fees for variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) insurance and higher other revenues on certain consolidated limited partnerships.
 
Expenses
 
Compensation and benefits  Field increased 15 percent, or $63 million, to $486 million, primarily as a result of overall business growth as reflected by the 18 percent growth in GDC.
 
During the first quarter of 2006, the Company incurred compensation and benefits expenses related to the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
Compensation and benefits  Non-field increased 13 percent, or $40 million, to $356 million. This reflected a $20 million increase in compensation and benefits for technology services included in the "Other expenses" line in the first quarter of 2006, a $16 million increase primarily related to the Threadneedle equity participation plan from recognizing the full year fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007, as well as the impact of company-wide annual merit increases.
 
Interest credited to account values declined 11 percent, or $37 million, to $287 million, primarily reflecting continued declines in annuity fixed account and certificate balances.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses declined 4 percent, or $8 million, to $219 million, due to a $12 million net increase in disability income insurance reserves, which was more than offset by decreases in RiverSource variable annuity benefit reserves and continuing favorable loss development in property casualty lines.
 
Amortization of deferred acquisition cost (DAC) expenses increased 5 percent, or $6 million, to $134 million. The increase reflected volume-driven increases in variable annuity DAC amortization and the favorable impact of equity market appreciation recorded in the first quarter of 2006.
 
Interest and debt expense increased 39 percent, or $9 million, to $32 million, reflecting costs associated with the issuance of $500 million of junior subordinated notes (hybrid securities) in May 2006.
 
Other expenses were essentially unchanged at $248 million, reflecting the shift of technology services to employee-related costs, offset by investments in compliance and other legal and regulatory costs, as well as increased other expenses on certain consolidated limited partnerships. Results for the first quarter of 2006 included costs related to the defined contribution recordkeeping business.
 
Separation costs incurred in the quarter were $85 million, the largest component of which related to reestablishing the Company's technology infrastructure. Since the announcement of the spin off, the Company has incurred $739 million in non-recurring separation costs.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income was 23.6 percent for the quarter, down from 24.0 percent in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 26.9 percent, up from 26.7 percent from the first quarter of 2006.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 5.9 million shares for approximately $352 million. Over the past five quarters, the Company repurchased 16.6 million shares for $823 million. The quarter-end basic share count was 238.5 million and the ending diluted share count was 241.6 million. The average diluted share count for the quarter was 244.1 million.
 
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted two accounting standards resulting in a combined cumulative accounting adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $138 million. The adoption of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 05-1, "Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts," decreased retained earnings by $134 million; and FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," decreased retained earnings by $4 million.
 
Shareholders' equity as of March 31, 2007 was $7.7 billion, an increase of $390 million compared to March 31, 2006, as strong operating performance and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income were offset by share repurchases. Book value per outstanding share was $32.60 as of March 31, 2007.
 
The Company remains committed to maintaining the safety and soundness of its balance sheet, continuing to maintain substantial liquidity and a high quality investment portfolio, and continuing to manage and mitigate risk exposures.
 
Cash and cash equivalents were more than $2.4 billion.
 - 
                 
 
The quality of the Available-for-Sale fixed income investment portfolio, representing approximately 30 percent of balance sheet assets, remained high.
 - 
                 
 
The percentage of below investment grade assets declined to 6 percent.
 - 
                 
 
Residential mortgage backed bond portfolio remains very high quality and low risk:
 - 
                 
 
Interest rate risk and prepayment risk is limited, with a short duration of 2.3 years and favorable convexity of - -0.9.
 - 
                 
 
Credit risk is limited with 96 percent rated AAA and 4 percent rated AA.
 - 
                 
 
Unrealized net investment losses in the Available-for-Sale investment portfolio declined to $0.2 billion at quarter end, primarily due to changes in interest rates.
 - 
                 
 
The debt to capital ratio as of March 31, 2007 was 22.3 percent. The debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 16.7 percent. For the first quarter of 2007, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.4 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 7.0 times.
 - 
                 
 
 
 
First Quarter 2007 Segment Results
 
The AA&I segment represented 73 percent of consolidated revenues and 77 percent of adjusted earnings. Revenues grew 5 percent, or $75 million, to $1.5 billion. The impact of the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business lowered revenue growth by 1 percent. Growth in management and distribution fee revenues, reflecting strong wrap and variable annuity inflows, was partially offset by declining net investment income from lower annuity fixed account and certificate balances, as well as the impact of the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business. Pretax income in this segment grew 2 percent, or $4 million, as increased expenses reflected a $16 million increase related to the Threadneedle equity participation plan from recognizing the full year fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007.
 
The Protection segment represented 24 percent of consolidated revenues and 34 percent of adjusted earnings. Revenues grew 6 percent, or $27 million, to $500 million, primarily reflecting Auto and Home premium growth and increased revenues from the VUL/UL business. Pretax income in this segment grew 36 percent, or $27 million, as operating and benefits expenses remained flat. Overall favorable benefits expenses were offset by an unfavorable $12 million adjustment in reserves for disability income insurance claims. This $12 million unfavorable adjustment was the net of a $24 million increase in reserves from revising certain valuation calculations and a $12 million benefit reflecting recent claims experience.
 
The Corporate segment revenue growth of 22 percent, or $12 million, primarily reflected increased financial planning fees. The pretax loss in this segment increased $6 million to $117 million, primarily reflecting an $18 million increase in pretax separation costs and $11 million in severance charges recorded in the prior year period. The adjusted pretax loss in this segment, excluding separation costs, decreased $12 million to $32 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  This report includes information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of the separation from American Express Company, which consist of AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs.  These non-GAAP financial measures, which management views as important indicators of financial performance, include:
 
  Consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude after-tax separation costs;
 - 
  Total expenses before separation costs;
 - 
  Adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance) and separation costs;
 - 
  Income before income tax provision, discontinued operations and separation costs;
 - 
  Income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs;
 - 
  Income before separation costs;
 - 
  Separation cost, after-tax;
 - 
  Adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and
 - 
  Pretax segment loss before separation costs.
 - 
 
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts better reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.  These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents a debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt of a CDO consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R) and non-recourse debt of property fund limited partnerships managed by Threadneedle consolidated in accordance with EITF 04-5. Management believes that the debt to capital ratio excluding this non-recourse debt better represents the Company's capital structure.

Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges.  Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking Since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.  RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes.  Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.
Important Disclosures
 
An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about the funds, call (800) 297-3863, TTY: (800) 846-4852. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
 
The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies often involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may under perform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds, generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.  The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much as interest rates in general.  Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance.  The floating rate loans and securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
 
Portfolio Builder, Income Builder and Retirement Plus Series The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments. See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
