Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On July 25, 2007, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2007.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company which consist of non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude separation costs; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude separation costs); income before income tax provision and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; effective tax rate on adjusted earnings; adjusted pretax segment income; return on allocated equity adjusted for pretax segment income; and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure. In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  July 25, 2007 Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Adjusted earnings increased 22 percent to $237 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006. Adjusted earnings exclude after-tax non-recurring separation costs.

Net income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2007 was $0.81, an increase of 42 percent from the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2007 were $0.98, an increase of 24 percent from the year-ago period.
 
Revenues grew 6 percent to $2.2 billion in the second quarter of 2007. Revenues grew 10 percent excluding the proceeds from the sale of the defined contribution recordkeeping business in the prior year quarter. This reflected strong growth of fee-based businesses, including 20 percent growth in management, financial advice and service fees and 28 percent growth in distribution fees.
 
Return on equity for the 12 months ended June 30, 2007 was 9.2 percent, or 12.5 percent when adjusted for the separation, up from 10.7 percent for the 12 months ended June 30, 2006.
 
"This was another strong quarter for Ameriprise Financial, highlighted by continued improvements in advisor productivity and growth in our fee-based businesses," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to execute our growth strategy while effectively managing expenses and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The quarter also marked the achievement of two important milestones  we have essentially completed our separation from American Express and have returned to net inflows in RiverSource Funds."

Second Quarter 2007 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude non-recurring separation costs from all periods. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for year-end 2006, filed on February 27, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
Second Quarter 2007 Consolidated Highlights
 
The Company continued to drive improvements in the profitability and productivity of its distribution network:
 
Mass affluent and affluent client groups increased 12 percent from the year-ago period, with high rates of financial planning penetration for newly acquired clients in this core group.
 - 
                 
 
Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) increased 20 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting strong advisor productivity gains.
 - 
                 
 
Franchisee advisor retention remained strong at 93 percent. The total number of advisors decreased 2 percent over the same time period, as the Company hired fewer employee advisors and continued to focus on further strengthening advisor productivity and distribution economics.
 - 
                 
 
The Company successfully grew client assets:
 
Owned, managed and administered assets increased 13 percent from the prior-year period, reaching $484 billion at June 30, 2007.
 - 
                 
 
RiverSource Funds achieved net inflows of $0.7 billion from mutual funds and annuity variable accounts, primarily due to increasing sales driven by strong investment performance, increased penetration of goal-based solutions and effective wholesaling.
 - 
                 
 
$3.5 billion of net inflows in wrap accounts in the quarter contributed to total ending wrap assets of $89 billion. This included more than $1.1 billion in ending assets in , a discretionary managed account platform launched in February 2007, which has been one of the Company's most successful product launches and further strengthens its leadership position in wrap.
 - 
                 
Active Portfolios
SM
 
Strong sales in the branded advisor and third party channels helped drive $1.5 billion in net inflows in annuity variable accounts. Overall positive annuity flows were impacted by $1.1 billion in net outflows from annuity fixed accounts during the quarter, primarily due to the interest rate environment.
 - 
                 
 
Threadneedle grew revenues from higher-margin retail and alternative portfolios while effectively managing expenses. Threadneedle continued to manage outflows in lower-margin institutional assets, primarily resulting from Zurich's transfer of part of its U.K. annuity business during the quarter.
 - 
                 
 
Life insurance in-force increased 8 percent year-over-year to $181 billion.
 - 
                 
 
The Company has essentially completed its separation from American Express on budget and on schedule. All remaining separation costs are expected to be incurred in the second half of 2007.

For this non-GAAP presentation of separation costs, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%, adjusted for permanent differences, if any.
Second Quarter 2007 Consolidated Results
 
Net income grew 39 percent to $196 million. Adjusted earnings grew 22 percent to $237 million, compared to the year-ago quarter. This reflected strong growth in fee-based businesses and expense controls resulting in pretax income margin improving to 11.2 percent compared to 9.1 percent a year ago. Excluding separation costs, pretax income margin improved to 14.1 percent from 13.2 percent.
 
Revenues
 
Consolidated revenues rose 6 percent, or $129 million, to $2.2 billion. Revenues grew 10 percent excluding the proceeds from the sale of the recordkeeping business in the prior-year quarter.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 20 percent, or $142 million, to $863 million, reflecting continued success in gathering fee-based assets. Wrap account balances grew 34 percent and annuity variable account assets grew 35 percent year-over-year. These balances were driven by strong net inflows and market appreciation.
 
Distribution fees grew 28 percent, or $90 million, to $415 million, driven by strong advisor cash sales, including an increase in sales of direct investments as clients reinvested proceeds from real estate investment trust liquidations.
 
declined 7 percent, or $37 million, to $485 million, reflecting the ongoing trend of declining annuity fixed account and certificate balances, offset by higher net investment income attributable to derivatives used to hedge certain benefits and interest credited expenses. The second quarter of 2007 also included $2 million in net realized investment gains, compared to $6 million for the second quarter of 2006.
Net investment income
 
Premiums grew 6 percent, or $14 million, to $243 million, primarily driven by an increase in Auto and Home policy counts.
 
Other revenues declined 31 percent, or $80 million, to $176 million, primarily due to the inclusion of $66 million in proceeds from the sale of the recordkeeping business and $18 million from recognizing previously deferred cost of insurance revenues in last year's quarter. Excluding these items, revenues increased 2 percent, as higher fees from variable annuity riders and cost of insurance for variable universal life/universal life (VUL/UL) insurance were offset by lower other revenues on certain consolidated limited partnerships.
 
Expenses
 
Consolidated expenses rose 5 percent, or $91 million, to $1.9 billion. Expenses grew 7 percent when excluding the costs from the sale of the recordkeeping business in the second quarter of 2006. The increase in expenses was primarily due to a $102 million increase in Compensation and benefits  field driven by business growth and strong advisor productivity.
 
The Company manages Compensation and benefits  non-field and Other expenses in relation to revenue growth to drive pretax income margin expansion. Combined, these two lines increased 2 percent, or $12 million, to $646 million. Declines related to lower legal and transaction costs were largely offset by a number of other items in the current quarter, such as expenses for Ameriprise Bank, increased investment in the business, and higher accrued compensation in recognition of year-to-date performance.
Compensation and benefits  Field increased 23 percent, or $102 million, to $538 million, due to strong advisor productivity growth.
 
Interest credited to account values declined 1 percent, or $4 million, to $303 million, reflecting continued declines in annuity fixed account and certificate balances, partially offset by higher crediting rates.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 2 percent, or $5 million, to $230 million. Volume-driven increases in Auto and Home were offset by the positive impact of markets on variable annuity benefits expenses. The second quarter of 2006 included a net reserve benefit.
 
Amortization of deferred acquisition cost (DAC) expenses declined 18 percent, or $28 million, to $125 million. The favorable impact of equity markets in the current quarter offset growth in DAC amortization from new product sales. Higher expenses in the second quarter of 2006 primarily reflected an adjustment to DAC balances in Auto and Home.
 
Interest and debt expense increased 14 percent, or $4 million, to $32 million, reflecting additional interest costs from the $500 million of junior subordinated notes (hybrid securities) issued in May 2006.
 
Separation costs incurred in the quarter were $63 million. Since the announcement of the spin-off, the Company has incurred $802 million in non-recurring separation costs and expects to incur all remaining costs in the second half of 2007.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income was 20.0 percent for the quarter, down from 24.3 percent in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 23.1 percent for the quarter and 25.0 percent year to date, compared to 25.2 percent for full year 2006. The current quarter included a benefit from the finalization of certain income tax audits.
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
The weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter of 2007 was 241.0 million, down from 248.0 million for the second quarter of 2006.
The Company maintains a very strong, high quality balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares for approximately $142 million. Over the past six quarters, the Company repurchased 18.9 million shares for $964 million. The quarter-end basic share count was 236.6 million.
 
The Company's commitment to maintaining the safety and soundness of its balance sheet is reflected in substantial liquidity, a high quality investment portfolio, low financial leverage and its continuing actions to manage and mitigate risk exposures.
 
Cash and cash equivalents were more than $3.3 billion, at June 30, 2007.
 -

Investments with subprime exposure represented only 0.7 percent of the Company's total investment portfolio with more than 90 percent rated AAA and the remainder rated AA.

The percentage of below investment grade assets declined to 6 percent.
 -

 - 
                 
 
The debt to capital ratio as of June 30, 2007 was 22.4 percent. The debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 16.9 percent. For the second quarter of 2007 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.9 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 7.6 times.
 - 
                 
 
Second Quarter 2007 Segment Results
 
The AA&I segment reported pretax income growth of 25 percent, or $56 million, to $278 million, due to strong wrap and variable annuity inflows, strong advisor cash sales, and market appreciation. The segment represented 74 percent of consolidated revenues and 90 percent of pretax adjusted earnings. Revenues grew 8 percent, or $123 million, to $1.6 billion. Excluding the proceeds from the sale of the recordkeeping business in the second quarter of last year, revenue growth was 13 percent. Revenues also reflected declining net investment income from lower annuity fixed account and certificate balances.
 
The Protection segment reported pretax income growth of 11 percent, or $10 million, to $102 million, primarily due to continued business growth in VUL/UL and Auto and Home. The segment represented 23 percent of consolidated revenues and 33 percent of pretax adjusted earnings. Revenues grew 2 percent, or $12 million, to $508 million, primarily reflecting growth in Auto and Home premiums. The prior year quarter included $18 million from recognizing previously deferred cost of insurance revenues. Excluding this item, revenues grew 6 percent.
 
The Corporate segment revenue decrease of 9 percent, or $6 million, primarily reflected lower net investment income from the mark-to-market of equity market hedges. The pretax loss in this segment increased $7 million to $135 million. Adjusted for non-recurring separation costs, the pretax loss increased $28 million to $72 million, primarily reflecting an increase in Other expenses. The second quarter of 2006 included $11 million in severance charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). This report includes information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of the separation from American Express Company, which consist of  AMEX Assurance and non-recurring separation costs. These non-GAAP financial measures, which management views as important indicators of financial performance, include: 
 
  Consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude separation costs;
 - 
  Total expenses before separation costs;
 - 
  Adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance) and separation costs;
 - 
  Income before income tax provision and separation costs;
 - 
  Income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs;
 - 
 Income before separation costs;
 - 
  Separation cost, after-tax;
 - 
  Adjusted return on allocated equity (adjusted to exclude AMEX Assurance); and
 - 
  Pretax segment income (loss) before separation costs.

Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts better reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.

Fund Performance & Lipper Ranking
As of June 30, 2007
Source of Data:  Lipper
 
Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges.  Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking Since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.  RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes.  Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.
Important Disclosures
 
An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about the funds, call (800) 297-3863, TTY: (800) 846-4852. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
 
The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies often involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may under perform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds, generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.  The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much as interest rates in general.  Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance.  The floating rate loans and securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
 
Portfolio Builder, Income Builder and Retirement Plus Series The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments. See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
