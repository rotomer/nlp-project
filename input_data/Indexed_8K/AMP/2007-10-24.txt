Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On October 24, 2007, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2007.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company which consist of non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude separation costs; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude separation costs); income before income tax provision and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; effective tax rate on adjusted earnings; adjusted pretax segment income; return on allocated equity adjusted for pretax segment income; and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure. In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  October 24, 2007 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $198 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 14 percent from net income of $174 million for the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 3 percent to $237 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to the third quarter of 2006. Adjusted earnings exclude after-tax non-recurring separation costs.
 
Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2007 was $0.83, an increase of 17 percent from the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of 2007 were $0.99, an increase of 5 percent from the year-ago period.
 
Revenues grew 11 percent to $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2007, reflecting continued strong growth of fee-based businesses, including 22 percent growth in management, financial advice and service fees, 17 percent growth in distribution fees, and higher net investment income from variable annuity-related hedges.
 
Return on equity for the 12 months ended September 30, 2007 was 9.4 percent, or 12.4 percent when adjusted for the separation, an increase from 11.2 percent from a year ago.
 
"Our operating results demonstrate the strength and diversity of our business model," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite the turbulent market conditions during the quarter, we delivered solid growth in revenue, assets and advisor productivity and continue to maintain a high quality balance sheet."
 
Third Quarter 2007 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude non-recurring separation costs from all periods. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year-end 2006, filed on February 27, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fourth quarter of 2007 will mark the final quarter for recognizing separation-related costs.
 
Included in consolidated net income and adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2007 and 2006 were pretax net realized investment gains from Available-for-Sale securities of $15 million and $14 million, respectively.
 
As part of our annual detailed review of deferred acquisition cost (DAC) valuation assumptions (DAC unlocking), we reported a $30 million negative impact to pretax income in the third quarter of 2007, compared to a $25 million benefit in the prior-year period.
Third Quarter 2007 Consolidated Highlights
 
We continued to drive improvements in the profitability and productivity of our distribution network:
 
Mass affluent and affluent client groups increased 11 percent from the year-ago period, with high rates of financial planning penetration for newly acquired clients in this core group.
 - 
                 
 
Gross Dealer Concession (GDC) increased 14 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting continued strong advisor productivity gains.
 - 
                 
 
The number of total advisors was 12,003, down 3 percent, as we continue to re-engineer the platform to strengthen employee advisor productivity and distribution economics. However, the number of franchisee advisors was 7,712, up 2 percent, reflecting continued strong franchisee advisor retention rates.
 - 
                 
 
We successfully grew client assets:
 
Owned, managed and administered assets increased 12 percent from the prior-year period, reaching $492 billion at September 30, 2007.
 - 
                 
 
Wrap account total ending assets increased 33 percent to $93 billion, including more than $2.6 billion of net inflows during the quarter.

Active Portfolios

 - 
                 
 
Strong sales in the Ameriprise and third party channels helped drive $1.3 billion in net inflows in annuity variable accounts. Overall annuity net inflows of $0.3 billion were impacted by continued net outflows from annuity fixed accounts.
 - 
                 
 
Threadneedle Investments announced its acquisition of Convivo Capital Management, which further strengthens its alternative investment capabilities.
 - 
                 
 
Life insurance in-force increased 8 percent year-over-year to $184 billion.

For this non-GAAP presentation of separation costs, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%, adjusted for permanent differences, if any.
Third Quarter 2007 Consolidated Results
 
Net income grew 14 percent to $198 million. Adjusted earnings grew 3 percent to $237 million, compared to the year-ago quarter. Our underlying business results continue to reflect the benefits of our diversified business model, strong growth in fee-based products and expense controls.
 
There were a number of material disclosed items in both the third quarters of 2007 and 2006. In total, these items positively impacted net income and adjusted earnings by $5 million in the third quarter of 2007 compared to $38 million in the third quarter of 2006.
 
Revenues
 
Consolidated revenues rose 11 percent, or $225 million, to $2.2 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in management and distribution fees, combined with above trend growth in net investment income, primarily from variable annuity-related hedges.
 
Management, financial advice and service fees grew 22 percent, or $158 million, to $878 million, reflecting continued success in growing assets in fee-based accounts. Wrap account balances grew 33 percent and annuity variable account assets grew 31 percent year-over-year. These balances were driven by strong net inflows and market appreciation.
 
Distribution fees increased 17 percent, or $52 million, to $352 million. Underlying business activity was strong, with total cash sales increasing 21 percent over the prior-year period.
 
increased 2 percent, or $10 million, to $552 million, reflecting higher net investment income attributable to hedges for variable annuity living benefits, partially offset by expected declines in annuity fixed account and certificate balances. Negative investment income on trading securities was offset by a decrease in the loan loss provision for commercial real estate loans.
Net investment income
 
Premiums grew 1 percent, or $2 million, to $246 million. Year-over-year growth in our Auto and Home business was offset by declines in long-term care premiums.
 
Other revenues increased 2 percent, or $3 million, to $174 million, primarily due to higher fees from variable annuity riders and cost of insurance for variable universal life/universal life insurance, which were largely offset by lower other revenues on certain consolidated limited partnerships.
 
Expenses
 
Consolidated expenses before separation costs rose 15 percent, or $252 million, to $1.9 billion, primarily driven by higher field compensation due to business growth, the year-over-year impact of DAC unlocking and by benefit expense increases related to variable annuity living benefit riders. The higher benefit expenses were partially offset by the increase in net investment income from related hedges and lower amortization of DAC related to these products.
 
Compensation and benefits  Non-field and Other expenses combined increased less than 1 percent, or $5 million, to $581 million, year-over-year. This reflects our focus on expense management across multiple quarters to drive pretax income margin expansion.
 
Compensation and benefits  Field increased 22 percent, or $94 million, to $522 million, due to overall business growth and continued increases in advisor productivity.
Interest credited to account values declined 11 percent, or $35 million, to $282 million, reflecting continued declines in annuity fixed account and certificate balances.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 64 percent, or $150 million, to $383 million. Growth was primarily driven by expenses from the mark-to-market of variable annuity living benefit riders, which was partially offset by higher net investment income and a decline in DAC amortization.
 
Amortization of deferred acquisition costs rose 47 percent, or $41 million, to $128 million, primarily driven by a $16 million increase in the third quarter of 2007 compared to a $38 million decrease in the prior-year period, resulting in a net $54 million increase in amortization from our annual third quarter detailed review. Underlying increases in DAC amortization driven by business growth were offset by lower DAC amortization resulting from the mark-to-market of variable annuity living benefit riders.
 
We incurred $60 million in separation costs in the quarter and expect to incur approximately $25-30 million in costs in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting all remaining separation costs.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income was 8.8 percent for the quarter, down from 19.8 percent in the prior-year period. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 14.4 percent for the quarter and 21.7 percent year-to-date. The current quarter included a $21 million tax benefit resulting from our plan to begin repatriating Threadneedle earnings through dividends as a result of their continued strong results. We expect the full year 2007 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings to be approximately 23 percent, compared to 25.2 percent for full year 2006. We expect the 2008 effective tax note to be approximately 26 to 27 percent.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
The weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter of 2007 was 239.2 million, down from 246.4 million for the third quarter of 2006.
We maintain a very strong, high quality balance sheet. During the third quarter of 2007, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for approximately $171 million. Year-to-date as of September 30, 2007, we repurchased 11.1 million shares for approximately $665 million, leaving approximately $701 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. The quarter-end weighted average basic share count was 235.4 million, down from 244.5 million for the third quarter of 2006.
 
Our commitment to maintain the safety and soundness of our balance sheet is reflected in substantial liquidity, a high quality investment portfolio, low financial leverage and our continuing actions to manage and mitigate risk exposures.
 
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $4.0 billion at September 30, 2007.
 - 
                 
 
Our investment portfolio remains high quality.
 - 
                 
 
We recognized no impairments in the quarter.
 - 
                 
 
We experienced no rating downgrades in our Alt-A or subprime-related securities.
 - 
                 
Unrealized net investment losses in the Available-for-Sale investment portfolio were $0.4 billion at quarter end, down from $0.6 billion in the prior quarter.
 - 
                 
 
The debt to capital ratio as of September 30, 2007 was 22.1 percent. The debt to capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 16.7 percent. For the third quarter of 2007, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.2 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.7 times.

Third Quarter 2007 Segment Results
 
The AA&I segment reported pretax income growth of 35 percent, or $67 million, to $259 million, primarily due to strong wrap and variable annuity inflows, strong advisor cash sales, and market appreciation, reflected in 20 percent growth in fees. Revenues and expenses in this segment include the negative impact of the mark-to-market on variable annuity benefit riders, related hedges, and amortization of DAC. DAC unlocking had an immaterial impact on AA&I segment results in the quarter. The segment represented 74 percent of consolidated revenues and 94 percent of pretax adjusted earnings.
 
The Protection segment reported a pretax income decline of 52 percent, or $78 million, to $73 million, primarily due to a net $70 million year-over-year negative impact from the annual DAC unlocking. The increased amortization of DAC in the quarter was primarily due to changes in product persistency assumptions and does not reflect any fundamental deterioration of the business. Overall, Protection segment results reflect an increase insurance in-force and claims meeting expectations. The Protection segment represented 24 percent of consolidated revenues and 26 percent of pretax adjusted earnings.
The Corporate segment pretax loss improved $11 million to $115 million. Adjusted for non-recurring separation costs, the pretax loss increased $16 million to $55 million. Corporate segment revenue increased 16 percent, or $9 million, primarily reflecting higher advice fees.

Important Disclosures
 
Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges. Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date. When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit. RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50 is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes. Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.
Important Disclosures
 
An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of mutual funds carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about the funds, call (800) 297-3863, TTY: (800) 846-4852. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
 
The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies often involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The investment process used to manage the RiverSource Disciplined Equity Fund employs new technologies and statistical methods that have not previously been used to manage open-end mutual funds. Shareholders should be prepared for the possibility that the Fund may under perform its benchmark. While RiverSource Investments seeks to control trading activity, the Fund may trade more often than other funds in its peer group. Trading activity may result in increased fees, expenses and taxes.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds, generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principle and income than investment grade securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much as interest rates in general. Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance. The floating rate loans and securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
 
Portfolio Builder, Income Builder and Retirement Plus Series, The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments. See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
