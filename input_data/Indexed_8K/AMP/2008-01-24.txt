Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On January 24, 2008, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2007.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2007.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company which consist of non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude separation costs; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude separation costs, after-tax); adjusted pretax income (adjusted to exclude separation costs ); income before income tax provision and separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income; return on allocated equity adjusted for pretax segment income; and pretax segment loss before separation costs. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure.  In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  January 24, 2008 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007. For the fourth quarter of 2007, net income was $255 million, an increase of 49 percent from net income of $171 million for the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings increased 9 percent to $274 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Adjusted earnings for the quarters exclude after-tax non-recurring separation costs.
 
Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $1.08, an increase of 57 percent from the prior year period. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.16, an increase of 14 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
Net revenues grew 8 percent to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting continued strong growth in management and financial advice fees, up 25 percent, lower net investment income from declining fixed annuity balances and higher other revenues from certain transactions.
 
Return on equity for 2007 was 10.5 percent, compared to 8.3 percent for 2006. Excluding separation costs, return on equity was 12.6 percent, an increase from 11.8 percent from the prior year. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for $283 million, bringing full year repurchases to $948 million.
 
For the full year, net income grew 29 percent to $814 million, and adjusted earnings increased 12 percent to $968 million. Net income per diluted share was $3.39 for 2007, up 33 percent compared to 2006, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $4.03, up 16 percent. Net revenues grew 8 percent, to $8.7 billion.
 
"Our solid results in the fourth quarter reflect the strength in our integrated business model, risk management and conservative balance sheet," said Jim Cracchiolo,
chairman and chief executive officer. "While we were impacted by the difficult market environment, I am pleased with the operating results we generated.
 
"We are executing our strategy and feel good about our business model, which is focused on serving clients in long-term advice relationships. We continue to invest prudently and manage expenses appropriately.
 
"Our high quality balance sheet is an important component of our business success. Our conservative approach and risk management capabilities helped us end the year without material impairments in our investment portfolio."
 
Fourth Quarter 2007 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of our ongoing operations. The adjusted financial measures exclude non-recurring separation costs from all periods. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year-end 2006, filed on February 27, 2007 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is the final quarter in which we will recognize separation-related costs.
 
 
Included in consolidated net income and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $12 million, or $0.05 per share, in after-tax realized investment gains. This compares to $18 million, or $0.07 per share, in after-tax realized investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
As in the prior year period, results for fourth quarter 2007 included a number of disclosed items impacting earnings
(1)
. Our fourth quarter 2007 results on a normalized basis were solid and met our financial targets. Items for the quarter are summarized below and discussed throughout this release. Combined, these items and our investment gains resulted in a net benefit to fourth quarter 2007 earnings of $0.13 per share.
 
                 
We deconsolidated a variable interest entity due to our sale of certain interests, which resulted in a $44 million, or $0.19 per share, after-tax benefit and generated a tax capital loss. We also received additional proceeds from the 2006 sale of our defined contribution recordkeeping business, resulting in a $16 million, or $0.07 per share, after-tax benefit.
 
                 
These benefits were partially offset by increases to certain reserves by a net after-tax total of $27 million, or $0.12 per share, which primarily impacted general and administrative expense.
 
                 
The extraordinary levels of market movement during the quarter negatively impacted returns on owned hedge fund investments and seed money, as well as amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), which combined, impacted earnings by $0.06 per share.
 
The same categories of items in the fourth quarter 2006 benefited earnings by a net $30 million after tax, or $0.12 per share.

Fourth Quarter 2007 Business Highlights
 
During the quarter, we delivered solid operating results. While the market environment impacted overall asset levels and activity, we generated positive flows in core products.
 
                 
Mass affluent and affluent client assets increased 10 percent over a year ago.
 
                 
Our focus on serving more clients in financial planning relationships resulted in an 8 percent increase in financial planning net cash sales among branded advisors.
 
                 
We continued to improve advisor productivity, with net revenue per advisor increasing 11 percent, and our franchisee advisor retention remaining strong at 93 percent. Advisor sales volumes were impacted by the market environment and clients' current preference for higher cash positions. In addition, fourth quarter 2006 sales were increased by client reinvestment of proceeds from certain real estate investment trust liquidations.
 
                 
Owned, managed and administered assets increased 3 percent year-over-year, to $480 billion as of December 31, 2007, but decreased from $492 billion as of September 30, 2007. Solid inflows into core products were offset by market-driven asset declines of $8 billion and continued Zurich-related outflows at Threadneedle.
 
                 
Wrap account total ending assets increased 23 percent to $93.9 billion, including more than $1.8 billion of net inflows during the quarter.
 
                 
Net inflows in variable annuities reached $1.1 billion, which contributed to total variable annuity ending balances reaching $57.2 billion. Overall annuity net inflows of $0.4 billion were impacted by continued net outflows from fixed annuities.
 
                 
RiverSource
Funds achieved net inflows of $0.2 billion during the quarter.
 
                 
50 percent of Funds internally managed assets were in portfolios above the median of their respective Lipper peer groups for 1-year investment performance, with three- and five-year track records remaining solid.
RiverSource
 
                 
Threadneedle delivered its strongest year ever for equity investment performance, resulting in 80 percent of retail equity portfolios ending the year above the median of their respective peer groups. Threadneedle experienced $4.5 billion in institutional net outflows, with the vast majority from lower-margin Zurich-related accounts.
 
                 
Life insurance in-force increased 8 percent year-over-year to $187 billion.
 
                 
Our capital position, balance sheet and asset quality all remained strong. We did not recognize any material impairments during the quarter or full year and continued to benefit from our approach to enterprise risk management.

For this non-GAAP presentation of separation costs, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%, adjusted for permanent differences, if any.
Fourth Quarter 2007 Consolidated Results
 
Net income grew 49 percent to $255 million. Adjusted earnings grew 9 percent to $274 million, compared to the year-ago quarter.
 
Net Revenues
 
Consolidated net revenues rose 8 percent, or $180 million, to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued strong growth in management and financial advice fees. Declines in net investment income driven by fixed annuity account balance runoff were partially offset by higher investment income from variable annuity-related hedges and higher other revenues from certain transactions.
 
Management and financial advice fees grew 25 percent, or $185 million, to $930 million, reflecting continued success in growing assets across our businesses.
                 
Wrap account balances grew 23 percent driving these fees in the Advice & Wealth Management segment up $86 million, or 30 percent.
                 
Continued net inflows into Funds and growth in Threadneedle hedge fund assets and performance fees, resulted in management fees in the Asset Management segment increasing $69 million, or 20 percent.
RiverSource
                 
Variable annuity balances grew 16 percent, resulting in an increase in fees in the Annuities segment of $28 million, or 25 percent.
 
Distribution fees declined 7 percent, or $29 million, to $415 million. This decline was partially due to atypically high fees in the Advice & Wealth Management segment in the fourth quarter of 2006 from clients reinvesting proceeds from certain REIT liquidations. In addition, clients increased cash holdings during the quarter, resulting in a $0.9 billion sequential increase in deposit product balances. We believe this contributed to a $1.2 billion decrease in cash sales, the primary driver of distribution fees, in the Advice & Wealth Management segment. These declines were partially offset by growth in the Annuities and Protection segments.
 
Net investment income
decreased 12 percent, or $69 million, to $524 million, due to lower balances in our spread products; declines of $36 million in other investment income, which included owned hedge fund and seed money investments; and a $9 million decrease in realized gains. These declines were partially offset by living benefit hedge-related income and business growth in the Protection segment.
                 
Advice & Wealth Management segment net investment income declined $35 million primarily due to the impact of hedges for stock market certificates as well as lower certificate balances.
                 
Annuities segment net investment income declined $19 million, primarily due to the continued decrease in fixed annuity balances, as well as a $15 million decline due to the impact of hedges for equity indexed annuities. These declines were partially offset by a $69 million increase, to $66 million, in income from variable annuity-related hedges.
                 
Asset Management segment net investment income declined $14 million, primarily due to declines in returns on seed money investments.
 
Premiums declined 1 percent, or $4 million, to $271 million. Protection segment premium growth of 4 percent, or $10 million, was driven by a 6 percent year-over-year increase in
Auto & Home policy counts. This growth was offset by declines in premiums from immediate payout annuities.
 
Other revenues increased 40 percent, or $65 million, to $228 million, primarily due to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity resulting in $68 million in other revenues, with $49 million included in the Annuities segment and $19 million included in the Protection segment. Other
revenues in the Asset Management segment included $25 million in additional proceeds from the 2006 sale of our defined contribution recordkeeping business, which was more than offset by the impact of the consolidation of certain limited partnerships holding client assets we manage. These consolidations had corresponding expense impacts primarily in the general and administrative expense line. Other revenues in the Protection segment increased 25 percent, or $27 million, due to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity and growth in cost-of-insurance fees for variable universal life/universal life insurance.
 
Expenses
 
Consolidated expenses before separation costs rose 8 percent, or $140 million, to $2.0 billion, primarily driven by growth in business activity and the impact of market volatility on variable annuity living benefit riders and higher DAC amortization.
 
Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased 18 percent, or $43 million, reflecting ongoing declines in fixed annuity balances as well as lower crediting rates on equity indexed annuities.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 17 percent, or $50 million, to $342 million. This increase was the result of a $60 million increase, to $67 million, in expenses from the mark-to-market of variable annuity living benefit riders and the impact of the application of SOP 03-1 on variable annuity living benefit reserves. Excluding the impact of the application, hedged variable annuity riders after DAC and after tax negatively impacted adjusted earnings by $9 million. In addition, Protection segment benefit expenses declined $18 million primarily due to lower claims.
 
Amortization of DAC rose 58 percent, or $60 million, to $164 million. The impact of the equity market decline during the quarter lowered estimated gross profit for future periods resulting in an additional $8 million of DAC amortization compared to a $14 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2006. The remaining increase was driven by business growth and the impact of adopting SOP 05-1 in January 2007.
 
General and administrative expense increased 3 percent, or $22 million, to $698 million. Disclosed items in this line totaled $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, which included increased reserves related to legal and regulatory, other contingencies as well as severance. This compares to $31 million in increased legal and regulatory reserves in the fourth quarter of 2006. Asset Management segment expenses from the consolidation of limited partnerships under EITF 04-5, which had corresponding revenue offsets, decreased $45 million year-over-year. This decrease was offset by increased hedge fund performance compensation and higher levels of technology investments.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income was 24.4 percent for the quarter, up from 15.5 percent in the prior-year period. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 25.3 percent for the quarter and 22.7 percent for full year 2007, reflecting higher pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2006 had a $16 million tax benefit primarily due to the change of the effective state income tax rate applied to deferred tax assets as a result of our separation from American Express.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, we deconsolidated a variable interest entity due to our sale of certain assets. This action generated a capital loss for tax purposes and offset the tax liability for capital gains generated in 2007.
Segment Financial Highlights
 
Each of our business segments produced solid operating results despite challenging market conditions.
 
Advice & Wealth Management pretax income declined 8 percent, or $3 million, to $34 million, reflecting market impacts and higher levels of investment spending. During the quarter, we increased advisor productivity, generated inflows in core products and grew financial planning fees. Net revenues increased 4 percent, or $37 million, to $947 million, driven primarily by 30 percent growth in management and financial advice fees. This was offset by declines in distribution fees reflecting atypically high fees in the fourth quarter of 2006 and lower net investment income from declining on-balance sheet deposits. Expenses continued to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. Expenses grew 5 percent due to business growth and technology investments, offset by lower legal and regulatory costs.
 
Asset Management pretax income grew 40 percent, or $31 million, to $108 million, reflected in growth in higher yielding assets and proceeds from the 2006 sale of our defined contribution recordkeeping business. These benefits were offset by market-driven losses on seed money investments and the impact of markets on asset values. Net revenues increased 6 percent, or $28 million, to $492 million, which included a decline in revenues of $45 million from the consolidation of certain limited partnerships under EITF 04-5. The impact of a 3 percent decline in assets under management was more than offset by a shift to higher fee yielding assets and increased performance management fees. Total expenses declined 1 percent, or $3 million, to $384 million as higher distribution costs and performance compensation were offset by lower expenses from the consolidation of certain limited partnerships.
 
Annuities pretax income declined 13 percent, or $19 million, to $128 million, primarily as a result of the market impact in the comparable quarters on variable annuity DAC amortization, which increased DAC amortization expense by $21 million. Our living benefit hedging performed well with negative impacts offset by the benefit of the application of SOP 03-1. Gains of $49 million from the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity were more than offset by a decline in earnings from lower fixed annuity balances.
 
Protection pretax income increased 40 percent, or $44 million, to $154 million, and included a $19 million gain from the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity. Net revenues increased 8 percent, or $41 million, to $524 million reflecting the variable interest entity benefit, higher premiums and increased cost of insurance fees. Expenses decreased 1 percent, or $3 million, to $370 million. Higher DAC amortization expense and general and administrative expense from business growth were offset by the impact of increased deferrals on distribution expenses and lower benefits expense across the business.
 
Corporate & Other pretax loss before separation costs increased $13 million to $58 million, most of which was driven by $11 million in severance costs related to reengineering initiatives.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
We maintain a strong, high quality balance sheet. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock for $283 million. We ended the year with more than $1 billion in excess capital. For the full year, we repurchased 15.9 million shares for $948 million, leaving $418 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. The quarter-end diluted share count was 233.0 million, and the weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 235.4 million.
Our commitment to maintaining the safety and soundness of our balance sheet is reflected in substantial liquidity, a high quality investment portfolio, low financial leverage and our continuing actions to manage risk exposures appropriately.
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007.
 
                 
Our balance sheet investments at year end 2007 remained high quality:
 
                 
We recognized no material impairments in the quarter.
 
                 
Unrealized net investment losses in the Available-for-Sale investment portfolio were $0.3 billion at quarter end, down from $0.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2007.
 
                 
The debt-to-capital ratio as of December 31, 2007 was 20.5 percent. The debt-to-capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 16.6 percent. For the fourth quarter of 2007, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 8.8 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 9.8 times.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).  This report includes information on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company, consisting of non-recurring separation costs.  These non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include:
 
Adjusted earnings;
Separation costs, after-tax;
Adjusted pretax income;
Adjusted pretax margin;
Adjusted earnings margin;
Adjusted return on equity;
Adjusted earnings per diluted share;
Total expenses before separation costs for the Corporate & Other segment; and
Pretax income and separation costs (adjusted pretax income).
 
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.  These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents debt to capital ratios excluding non-recourse debt of structured entities consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R),  EITF 04-5 and other accounting literature and with a 75% equity credit for the Company's junior subordinate debt.  Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this non-recourse debt better represents the Company's capital structure.

Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges.  Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.  RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes.  Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.

An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of mutual funds carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important
information about the funds, call (800) 297-3863, TTY: (800) 846-4852.  Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
 
The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies often involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same
risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing
and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general,
bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds,
generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax
rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.  The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk,
interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the
prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as
much as interest rates in general.  Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance.  The floating rate loans and
securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than
investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
 
Portfolio Builder, Income Builder and Retirement Plus Series, The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds"
comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are
discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments.
See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
