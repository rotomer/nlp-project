Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On April 22, 2008, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2008.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2008.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company which consist of non-recurring separation costs. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: consolidated income statements adjusted to exclude separation costs; total expenses before separation costs; adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude separation costs, after-tax); adjusted pretax income (adjusted to exclude separation costs ); pretax income before separation costs; income tax provision before tax benefit attributable to separation costs; income before separation costs; separation costs, after-tax; adjusted pretax segment income; return on allocated equity adjusted for pretax segment income; pretax operating earnings; and pretax operating earnings margin. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our 2007 operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures were used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure.  In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  April 22, 2008 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $191 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. The results represent a 16 percent increase from net income of $165 million in the prior-year quarter, which included $55 million in after-tax non-recurring separation costs.
 
Net income per diluted share for the quarter was $0.82, a 21 percent increase compared with the prior-year period. Excluding $0.22 of non-recurring separation costs in the first quarter of 2007, earnings per share declined 9 percent.
 
Net revenues increased 3 percent to $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting 10 percent growth in management and financial advice fees, partially offset by lower net revenues from certificates and fixed annuities.
 
Return on equity for the 12 months ended March 31, 2008 was 10.9 percent, an increase from 8.6 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2007. Excluding separation costs, return on equity was 12.2 percent for both 12-month periods. During the first quarter of 2008, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our common stock for $270 million.
 
We also announced today that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock over the next two years. Since 2006, we have purchased $1.7 billion of our common stock.
 
"We were impacted by the difficult market environment in the first quarter, which is clearly reflected in our financial results," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, we are comfortable with our underlying operating results. Our balance sheet, risk management and liquidity position remain strong. We are investing for growth while managing expenses to maintain margins."
First Quarter 2008 Summary
 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of our 2007 operations as it excludes non-recurring separation costs. This presentation is consistent with the non-GAAP financial information presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year-end 2007, filed on February 29, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
 After-tax for this non-GAAP presentation is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
(1)
#  Variance of 100% or greater.
 
Included in consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2008 were $16 million, or $0.07 per share, in after-tax net realized investment losses, primarily driven by $20 million in after-tax impairments of three Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. This loss compares to $6 million, or $0.02 per share, in after-tax realized investment gains in the first quarter of 2007. After-tax amounts are calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.
 
Our first quarter 2008 results included a number of impacts from equity market declines. Significant items for the quarter are referenced below and discussed within the release. Combined, these items negatively impacted first quarter earnings by $0.23 per share in the first quarter of 2008, compared to a $0.06 per share benefit in the first quarter of 2007.
 
Declines in management fees as well as increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) impacted results by $32 million after tax, or $0.14 per share.
                 
 
Other market impacts included increased living benefit expenses (net of hedges and DAC), losses in equity sensitive investments, lower short-term interest rates on our cash positions, and a benefit from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). These impacts resulted in a net loss of $21 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share.
                 
 
Of this $0.23 per share market impact, only $0.09 per share, related to lower asset levels and lower short-term interest rates, would be expected to continue if markets remain at current levels.
 
In addition to the market impacts, exceptional tax adjustments in the first quarter of 2008 increased earnings by $38 million, or $0.16 per share.
 
In total, the negative impact of net realized investment losses and declining markets combined with the benefit from the exceptional tax adjustments resulted in a $0.14 negative impact to earnings per share in the first quarter of 2008 compared to a $0.08 per share benefit in the prior-year quarter. A detailed schedule of this impact is included at the end of this release.
First Quarter 2008 Business Highlights
 
Our results reflect the impact of the difficult market environment on asset levels and client activity in the quarter as well as strength of our business model.
 
Despite market-related decreases in client activity, mass affluent and affluent client retention remained strong.
                 
 
Year-over-year improvement in advisor productivity contributed to 3 percent growth in advisor-related revenues.
                 
 
Franchisee advisor retention increased to 94 percent with total franchisee advisors growing 3 percent to 7,809.
                 
 
Owned, managed and administered assets decreased 5 percent year-over-year to $451 billion as of March 31, 2008, reflecting market declines and Threadneedle institutional outflows, partially offset by continued net inflows into wrap accounts and variable annuities.
                 
 
Wrap account total ending assets increased 10 percent to $90 billion, including $1.4 billion of net inflows during the quarter partially offset by market depreciation.
                 
 
Variable annuity total ending balances increased 6 percent to $54 billion, including $0.9 billion in net inflows during the quarter. Overall annuity net inflows of $0.3 billion during the quarter were impacted by continued net outflows from fixed annuities.
                 
 
Threadneedle institutional net outflows of $2.6 billion during the quarter were primarily driven by outflows from lower-margin Zurich assets.
                 
 
RiverSource Funds ending assets declined 2 percent to $80 billion due to net outflows of $0.6 billion and market depreciation.
                 
 
Threadneedle received two 2008 Lipper awards in the large category for Best Overall Group and Best U.K. Equity Group. In addition, RiverSource Funds re-branded Threadneedle-managed funds to introduce the brand in the United States and highlight the multi-office structure of our asset management group.
                 
 
Life insurance inforce increased 6 percent year-over-year to $189 billion.
                 
 
We launched our first branded payment cards with MasterCard Worldwideproviding clients with a suite of credit and debit products.
                 
 
Our capital position, balance sheet and asset quality remained strong, and we continued to benefit from our approach to enterprise risk management.
                 
 
We maintained substantial liquidity and have more than $1 billion of excess capital. Our excess capital position increased from the prior-year period.

First Quarter 2008 Consolidated Results
 
Net income grew 16 percent year-over-year to $191 million. Excluding $55 million in non-recurring after-tax separation costs in the first quarter of 2007, earnings declined 13 percent.
 
Total net revenues rose 3 percent, or $59 million, to $2.1 billion, reflecting continued growth in management and financial advice fees driven by asset inflows partially offset by market depreciation of assets. Declines in net investment income were driven by lower certificate and fixed annuity balances and net realized losses, which were partially offset by higher investment income from variable annuity-related hedges.
 
Management and financial advice fees grew 10 percent, or $69 million, to $791 million, reflecting continued success in growing assets and generating financial planning fee revenue.
 
Wrap account balances grew 10 percent, increasing management and financial advice fees in the Advice & Wealth Management segment by $61 million, or 20 percent.
                 
Variable annuity balances grew 6 percent, resulting in an increase in fees in the Annuities segment of $11 million, or 10 percent.
                 
Asset Management segment management and financial advice fees were impacted by market depreciation and were essentially flat.
                 
 
Distribution fees increased 4 percent, or $15 million, to $433 million, primarily driven by net inflows in wrap accounts and variable annuities. Within the Advice & Wealth Management segment, distribution fees declined primarily as a result of lower cash sales.
 
decreased 14 percent, or $72 million, to $460 million, primarily due to lower fixed annuity and certificate balances; declines of $36 million in other investment income, which included owned hedge fund and seed money investments; and $24 million in net realized investment losses. These declines were partially offset by living benefit hedge-related income.
Net investment income
 
Advice & Wealth Management segment net investment income declined $56 million, or 52 percent, primarily due to the impact of hedges for stock market certificates as well as lower certificate balances.
                 
Asset Management segment net investment income declined $21 million, due primarily to losses on seed money and other investments.
                 
Annuities segment net investment income increased $12 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to increased income from variable annuity-related hedges, partially offset by declines in fixed annuity account balances, net realized investment losses and hedges related to equity indexed annuities.
                 
 
Premiums increased 3 percent, or $8 million, to $265 million, primarily due to volume-related business growth. Protection segment premium growth of 5 percent, or $11 million, was driven by a 6 percent year-over-year increase in Auto & Home policy counts.
 
Other revenues declined 6 percent, or $10 million, to $157 million, due to the decline in revenues from certain limited partnerships consolidated under EITF 04-5. These partnerships had corresponding expense impacts primarily in the general and administrative expense line. This was partially offset by growth in cost-of-insurance fees for variable universal life/universal life insurance and increased revenue from variable annuity guarantee benefit riders.
 
Banking and deposit interest expense declined 71 percent, or $49 million, to $20 million, primarily due to lower crediting rates on certificate and banking products.
Expenses
 
Consolidated expenses before separation costs increased 10 percent, or $165 million, to $1.9 billion, as a result of business activity, the impact of market volatility on variable annuity living benefit riders and higher amortization of DAC.
 
Distribution expenses increased 13 percent, or $63 million, to $541 million, primarily driven by higher sales compensation due to faster growth in our franchisee advisor platform, as well as product mix shift.
 
Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased 18 percent, or $39 million, to $178 million, due to ongoing declines in fixed annuity balances and lower crediting rates on equity indexed annuities.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 62 percent, or $156 million, to $407 million. This increase was largely due to a $118 million increase in first quarter 2008 expenses from the mark-to-market of variable annuity living benefit riders, compared to a $28 million decline in the prior-year period. Protection segment benefit expenses increased 4 percent, or $8 million, primarily due to higher volume-related Auto & Home claims and reserves.
 
Amortization of DAC rose 15 percent, or $20 million, to $154 million. The impact of the equity market decline during the quarter lowered estimated gross profit for future periods, which resulted in an additional $24 million of DAC amortization compared to a $2 million benefit in the first quarter of 2007.
 
General and administrative expense decreased 5 percent, or $32 million, to $585 million, reflecting cost controls, lower legal and regulatory expenses and a decline in expenses from certain limited partnerships consolidated under EITF 04-5, which had corresponding revenue offsets. These declines were partially offset by increased expenses from technology enhancements.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate was 2.1 percent for the quarter, down from 23.6 percent in the prior-year period, primarily due to $38 million of exceptional tax adjustments. We expect our full-year 2008 tax rate to be in the 20-22 percent range, or 24-26 percent for the remaining three quarters of 2008 and for full-year 2009.
 
Segment Financial Highlights
 
Our segment results reflect both the difficult market environment and our efforts to control expenses while investing for growth. Detailed schedules of the market impact are included at the end of this release. Segment results do not include income taxes.
 
Advice & Wealth Management pretax income grew 14 percent, or $8 million, to $64 million, primarily driven by growth in wrap products, as continued net inflows were partially offset by market declines. We also generated pretax margin improvements primarily driven by re-engineering resulting in increased advisor productivity.
 
Asset Management pretax income declined 61 percent, or $28 million, to $18 million, primarily reflecting $10 million in losses on seed money investments in the quarter. In addition, market
declines on asset values negatively impacted revenues. Expenses remained well controlled, and we continue to invest in expanding our distribution capabilities.
 
Annuities pretax income declined 64 percent, or $76 million, to $42 million. The current quarter reflects a $25 million negative market impact on variable annuity DAC and DSIC amortization and $20 million in net realized  investment losses. Our living benefit hedging performed well with negative impacts mostly offset by the benefit of implementation of SFAS 157. Growth in variable annuity account values were offset by continued outflows in fixed annuities.
 
Protection pretax income declined 15 percent, or $18 million, to $102 million, due to a $17 million increase in amortization of DAC. We also had an $8 million benefit expense increase primarily due to higher volume-related Auto & Home claims and reserves.
 
Corporate & Other pretax loss before separation costs improved $8 million, to $31 million, which reflected our continued focus on expense management.
 
Balance Sheet and Capital
 
We continued to maintain a strong, high quality balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2008, we repurchased 5.2 million shares of our common stock for $270 million, essentially completing our third share repurchase authorization. In addition, the board of directors of Ameriprise Financial announced a new authorization for up to $1.5 billion through April 23, 2010.
 
We ended the quarter with more than $1 billion in excess capital. The weighted average diluted share count at March 31, 2008 was 231.5 million compared to 244.1 million as of March 31, 2007.
 
Our commitment to maintaining the safety and soundness of our balance sheet is reflected in substantial liquidity, a high quality investment portfolio, low financial leverage and our continuing actions to manage risk exposures appropriately.
 
We recognized $24 million in pretax net realized investment losses, primarily due to other than temporary impairments to fair value of three Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. We're comfortable with the valuation of our subprime and Alt-A positions and continue to monitor our portfolio as credit markets evolve.
                 
 
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $3.9 billion at March 31, 2008.
                 
 
Unrealized net investment losses in the Available-for-Sale investment portfolio were $0.5 billion at quarter end, up from $0.2 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2007.
                 
 
The debt-to-capital ratio as of March 31, 2008 was 21.0 percent. The debt-to-capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities was 17.0 percent. For the first quarter of 2008, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 6.2 times. Excluding interest on non-recourse debt, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was also 6.2 times.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).  This report includes information on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in this report exclude items that are a direct result of our separation from American Express Company, consisting of non-recurring separation costs.  These non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include:
 
Adjusted earnings;
Separation costs, after-tax;
Adjusted pretax income;
Adjusted pretax margin;
Adjusted earnings margin;
Adjusted return on equity;
Adjusted earnings per diluted share;
Pretax operating earnings;
Pretax operating earnings margin;
Total expenses before separation costs for the Corporate & Other segment; and
Pretax income and separation costs (adjusted pretax income).
 
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflect the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.  These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents debt to capital ratios excluding non-recourse debt of structured entities consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R),  EITF 04-5 and other accounting literature and with a 75% equity credit for the Company's junior subordinated debt.  Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this non-recourse debt better represent the Company's capital structure.

Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the  Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.
 
RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.

An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of mutual funds carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about the funds, call (800) 297-3863, TTY: (800) 846-4852.  Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
 
The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies often involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
The RiverSource Real Estate Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives. An investment in a real estate fund is subject to the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. Such risks include market risk, economic risk and mortgage rate risk.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including the impact of interest rates, credit and inflation. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the fund's prospectus. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds,  generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principle and income than investment grade securities.
 
High yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds, which generally have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk.
 
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund and the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.  The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much as interest rates in general. Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance.  The floating rate loans and securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments. See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
