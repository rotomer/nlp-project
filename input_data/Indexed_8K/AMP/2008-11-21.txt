Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") intends to record a pretax charge of approximately $40 million, or $26 million after-tax, in the fourth quarter of 2008. The charge results from merger-related costs associated with three acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter:
 
The acquisition by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Securities America Financial Corporation, of Brecek & Young Advisors, Inc. ("Brecek & Young"), which closed on October 31, 2008;
                 
The acquisition of HRB Financial Corporation (including its principal operating subsidiary, H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc., now known as Ameriprise Advisor Services, Inc.)("HRB"), which closed on November 1, 2008; and
                 
The acquisition of J. & W. Seligman & Co., Incorporated ("Seligman"), which closed on November 7, 2008.
                 
 
The Company expects the Brecek & Young and Seligman acquisitions to be accretive to earnings and return on equity in 2009, and the HRB acquisition to be accretive to earnings and return on equity in the first half of 2010.
