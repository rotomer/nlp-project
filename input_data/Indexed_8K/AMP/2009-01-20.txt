Item 8.01               Other Events.
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") will record a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $60 million in its fourth quarter 2008 results. The Company expects to realize over $130 million in annual run-rate expense savings as a result of accelerated re-engineering efforts. Savings in 2009 are expected to be over $80 million.
 
The Company expects to achieve these savings primarily through selective reductions in employee headcount. The Company's client service operations will be largely unaffected by these moves, and the Company is committed to maintaining its high level of service to clients and advisors.
