                On January 27, 2009, the Board of Directors ("Board") of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Registrant") was informed that Ira D. Hall and Richard F. Powers III, whose terms on the Board will expire at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on April 22, 2009, have chosen not to stand for re-election at that time. Messrs. Hall and Powers have informed that Board that their decisions are not the result of any disagreement with the Registrant.
 
                Mr. Hall has informed the Board that his board responsibilities at other public companies and charitable organizations have increased significantly in scope and require additional time commitments from him. Mr. Powers has informed the Board that he is actively pursuing business opportunities in financial services and asset management that will preclude his continued service on the Board.
 
"Since our 2005 spin-off from American Express, Ira and Dick have made significant contributions to our success in firmly establishing Ameriprise Financial as a public company," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.  "They will be leaving with the sincere thanks and appreciation of the Board and the executive leadership team."
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
