It has been the policy of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") to pay or reimburse executive officers and outside directors for the amount of certain taxes owed by them on perquisites and other personal benefits, as those items are determined consistent with the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  On March 30, 2009, the Company determined that it will no longer make such payments or reimbursements, effective as of January 1, 2009, except as provided in the next paragraph.
 
Notwithstanding the change in policy described above, the Company will continue to pay or reimburse executive officers and other employees for the amount of taxes owed by them that are attributable to the Company's reimbursement of certain expenses related to a relocation of their principal place of employment, to the extent provided under the applicable Company relocation program then in effect.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
