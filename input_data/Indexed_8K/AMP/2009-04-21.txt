Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On April 21, 2009, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2009.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2009.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that reflect certain after-tax market related impacts and our integration charges. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: core operating earnings; core operating earnings, after-tax; net investment (gains)/losses, after-tax; integration charges, after-tax; DAC and DSIC charges, after-tax; variable annuities benefits, after-tax; pretax segment income(loss) margin; pretax return on allocated equity; pretax return on allocated equity for pretax segment income (loss) excluding net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests; pretax income (loss) margin; net income (loss) attributable to Ameriprise Financial margin; pretax operating earnings; and pretax operating earnings margin. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our 2009 and 2008 operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures were used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sarl, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure.  In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  April 21, 2009 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $129 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009. The results represent a 32 percent decline from net income of $191 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
 
Earnings per common share for the first quarter of 2009 were $0.58, compared to $0.82 for the first quarter of 2008. First quarter 2009 results reflect the significant decline in equity markets and the lower short-term interest rate environment. These two factors negatively impacted year-over-year results by approximately $0.62 per share.
 
The 40 percent year-over-year decline in the S&P 500 Index contributed to a 14 percent decline in net revenues to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2009, compared to $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Management and financial advice fees and distribution fees were impacted by lower equity markets and clients' increased preference for short-term and fixed income investment products.
 
Management continues to reduce expenses in light of market-driven revenue declines. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2009 were down 1 percent from the prior year, and declined 15 percent excluding integration costs and additional expenses from acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
As of March 31, 2009, the company's estimated excess capital position increased to more than $1 billion. The company continues to maintain strong balance sheet fundamentals, including a large liquidity position and high-quality invested asset portfolio. The company's net unrealized investment loss position declined from year-end 2008 to $1.82 billion, and net realized investment gains were immaterial in the quarter.
 
"Despite the continued challenges presented by the market and economic conditions, our results demonstrate that the company has been positioned to manage through the current environment," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to manage aggressively for weak conditions over the short term. We are seeing benefits from our ongoing expense initiatives, and we continue to maintain solid balance sheet fundamentals and strong capital positions. At the same time, we continue to invest in our central value propositiondeep, enduring client-advisor relationships built around comprehensive financial planning. We are confident our strong financial foundation and diverse, resilient franchise will provide significant leverage as market conditions improve."
 
 
First Quarter 2009 Summary
 
Management believes the exclusion of after-tax impacts due to realized net investment gains (losses), non-recurring integration costs and market impacts on deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and variable annuity benefits best reflect the underlying performance of the business. For the non-GAAP presentation of after-tax amounts, the tax effect is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.

    For this non-GAAP presentation, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
Following are items excluded from core operating earnings to assist in reconciling with reported results. Each impact is presented after tax.
 
                 
$2 million in realized net investment gains, comprised of $33 million in realized investment gains, partially offset by $31 million for the credit-related component of other-than-temporary impairments.
 
                 
$12 million in integration charges related to the company's acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
                 
$30 million in increased amortization of deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) from lower period-ending account values.
 
                 
$35 million benefit related to variable annuities, consisting of:
                 
a $55 million benefit from hedged variable annuity living benefit guarantees, partially offset by $20 million in unhedged variable annuity benefit expenses.
 
Core operating earnings for the first quarter of 2009 included a $33 million after-tax gain on the repurchase of junior subordinated notes, partially offset by $12 million in operating losses from acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter of 2008. Market conditions both drove higher than anticipated acquisition costs and provided the opportunity to repurchase debt.
 
In addition to the items listed above, core operating earnings and net income in the first quarter of 2009 reflect an approximately $94 million, or $0.42 per share, year-over-year decline from the equity market's impact on asset levels and fee revenue, and an approximately $46 million, or $0.20 per share, year-over-year decline in investment income as a result of the short-term interest rate environment and higher liquidity levels. Results were also negatively impacted by market-related changes in client behavior.
 
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2009
 
Management's long-standing emphasis on risk-return decision making and prudent risk management has positioned the company well. While financial markets remained challenging during the quarter, management further enhanced the company's strong balance sheet fundamentals.
 
Substantial liquidity
     
Cash and cash equivalents were $5.8 billion, with $0.5 billion at the holding company level. Free cash remained at $4 billion, even as investments increased by $3.2 billion from the year-end 2008 balance.
     
The company joined the Federal Home Loan Bank and has access to more than $10 billion in liquidity through the pledge of mortgage-related assets.
     
The company has no debt maturities until November 15, 2010, maintains backup lines of credit at parent, subsidiary and mutual fund levels, and has no reliance on commercial paper, bank lines or other short-term institutional funding for liquidity.
 
Conservative capital management
     
The company's excess capital position was more than $1 billion.
     
The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk. The variable annuity hedging program continues to perform well during a protracted period of high volatility.
     
The company's adoption of FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, which provided new guidance for recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, increased retained earnings by approximately $131 million to $4.8 billion for non-credit related other-than-temporary impairments that were realized prior to January 1, 2009, and decreased accumulated other comprehensive income by the same amount. The net effect of the adoption had no impact on total Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity.
 
High quality investment portfolio
     
The company's $26 billion Available-for-Sale portfolio is both well-diversified and high-quality.
     
The net unrealized loss position declined to $1.82 billion from $1.84 billion at year-end 2008.
     
The company's total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, increased to $37 billion from $34 billion at year-end 2008, and remains well-positioned. Detailed information about the portfolio is available online at ir.ameriprise.com.
Conservative capital ratios
     
The debt-to-total capital ratio was 23.1 percent.
     
The debt-to-total capital ratio excluding non-recourse debt and with 75 percent equity credit for hybrid securities was 19.3 percent.
 
First Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
     
The company's client base remained stable, with continued strong retention of 94 percent.
 
     
Total advisors increased 7 percent to 12,466, compared to the first quarter of 2008, reflecting acquisitions in the prior quarter as well as continued strong advisor retention rates.
 
     
The company completed a strong quarter for experienced advisor recruitment, with approximately 200 experienced advisors joining the firm's branded advisor channels in the first quarter of 2009.
 
     
Owned, managed and administered assets were $354 billion as of March 31, 2009, down 21 percent compared to March 31, 2008, primarily due to the 40 percent decline in the S&P 500.
 
     
The company generated retail net inflows in the quarter, including $1.5 billion in fixed annuities, $1.3 billion in wrap accounts and $0.3 billion in variable annuities.
 
     
Total asset management net outflows declined substantially to $0.3 billion in the quarter, compared to net outflows of $5.2 billion in the first quarter of 2008 and net outflows of $8.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008.
 
     
Threadneedle formed a strategic partnership with Standard Chartered Bank to acquire the bank's World Express investment fund business with $2.7 billion in assets under management, as of December 31, 2008. Pending regulatory approval, the transaction provides Threadneedle with an established Luxembourg-based fund platform, which complements Threadneedle's existing range of funds.
 
     
Ameriprise Auto & Home premiums increased 5 percent from the prior year, primarily due to growth in policy counts.
 
     
The company continued to achieve re-engineering savings in the quarter. The company also took additional steps to generate re-engineering savings and now expects to achieve more than $350 million in savings in 2009, an increase from its previous full-year 2009 projection. Management expects the majority of the full-year savings will be realized in the second half of 2009 and intends to commit approximately two-thirds to the bottom line while reinvesting the remainder in growth initiatives.

First Quarter 2009 Consolidated Results
 
The company reported net income of $129 million for the first quarter of 2009, a 32 percent decline from net income of $191 million for the first quarter of 2008. Market-driven impacts to revenues and client behavior were partially offset by expense reductions.
 
Total net revenues declined 14 percent, or $273 million, to $1.7 billion, driven by lower management and financial advice fees and distribution fees, primarily due to the decline in equity markets and clients' increased preference for short-term and fixed income investment products. In addition, net revenues were impacted by the lower short-term interest rate environment.
 
Management and financial advice fees declined 30 percent, or $237 million, to $554 million, primarily due to lower equity markets as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation.
 
Distribution fees declined 28 percent, or $122 million, to $311 million, primarily due to changes in client behavior and lower asset levels. Clients' continued preference for cash and deposit products, which do not generate distribution fees, resulted in slowing sales and flows for other products.
 
Net investment income increased 5 percent, or $19 million, to $420 million, primarily due to $3 million in net realized investment gains compared to $24 million in net realized investment losses in the first quarter of 2008. The benefit of higher invested asset levels was more than offset by the impact of lower short-term interest rates.
 
Premiums increased 4 percent, or $10 million, to $266 million, primarily due to growth in Auto & Home premiums compared to the prior year.
 
Other revenues increased 33 percent, or $52 million, to $209 million, primarily due to a $50 million gain on the repurchase of junior subordinated notes.
 
Banking and deposit interest expense decreased 11 percent, or $5 million, to $42 million, primarily due to lower crediting rates on certificates, partially offset by higher certificate balances.
 
Expenses
 
Consolidated expenses declined 12 percent, or $216 million, to $1.6 billion, reflecting lower business volumes and continued strong expense controls. In addition, the company recorded lower expenses from hedged variable annuity living benefits due to a widening of the credit spread assumed in discounting liabilities.
 
Distribution expenses declined 28 percent, or $149 million, to $383 million, primarily due to decreases in advisor compensation reflecting a shift in client behavior and lower asset levels, which were both impacted by market declines.
 
Interest credited to fixed accounts increased 5 percent, or $10 million, reflecting higher annuity fixed account balances and higher average rates paid to clients compared to the prior year.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses declined 67 percent, or $204 million, to $100 million. Benefits associated with variable annuity guarantees represented a net gain of $182 million in the current quarter, compared to a net cost of $24 million in the first quarter of 2008. This result was largely attributable to the impact of credit spread widening on SFAS 157 liability values. This lower benefit expense was substantially offset by a related increase in DAC amortization.
 
Amortization of DAC increased 86 percent, or $132 million, to $286 million. The year-over-year increase included $160 million related to variable annuity guarantees. In addition, the impact of equity market depreciation on ending account values increased amortization by $40 million, compared to $24 million in the first quarter of 2008. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable annuity amortization driven by lower year-over-year account values and associated asset fees.
 
General and administrative expense declined 1 percent, or $5 million, to $585 million. Excluding $85 million in integration costs and ongoing expenses from acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of 2008, general and administrative expense declined 15 percent. This decline reflected expense controls and lower performance-driven compensation-related expenses.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 13.3 percent for the quarter, compared to 2.0 percent for the first quarter of 2008. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 included certain exceptional tax adjustments.

First Quarter 2009 Segment Financial Highlights
 
Advice & Wealth Management
reported a pretax loss of $56 million for the quarter, compared to pretax income of $64 million for the first quarter of 2008. First quarter 2009 results reflect the market-driven impact to assets, cash spreads and client behavior, as well as a current period loss related to the acquisition of H&R Block Financial Advisors. The segment's results also include $15 million in realized net investment losses in the quarter.
 
Asset Management
reported a pretax loss of $8 million for the quarter, compared to pretax income of $18 million for the first quarter of 2008. The decline was driven by market depreciation on assets, negative foreign currency translation and net outflows. Domestic net inflows in the quarter reflect improvement in retail net outflows and strong institutional net inflows. International net outflows include net inflows in both the retail and institutional higher margin businesses, offset by net outflows in the lower margin Zurich-related assets. The segment's general and administrative expenses remained well controlled, declining 16 percent from a year ago.
 
Annuities
reported pretax income of $124 million for the quarter, compared to pretax income of $42 million for the first quarter of 2008. Core operating earnings for the segment, which exclude market-driven impacts to variable annuity benefits expense and DAC amortization, were $97 million, compared to $94 million in the prior year. Clients' lower risk tolerances and preference for guaranteed returns reduced variable annuity net inflows and increased fixed annuity net inflows.
 
Protection
reported pretax income of $111 million, compared to $102 million for the first quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily driven by capital gains and Auto & Home business growth. Overall, life insurance cash sales declined from a year ago, driven by lower variable universal life sales, partially offset by growth in universal life sales.
 
Corporate & Other
reported a pretax loss of $24 million, compared to a pretax loss of $31 million for the first quarter of 2008. Segment results benefited from a $50 million gain from the repurchase of junior subordinated notes, partially offset by a $21 million net investment loss.
 
Dividend
 
The Ameriprise Financial board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per common share payable on May 18, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2009.

Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges.  Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.  RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes.  Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total. 
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.

The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals and Mining Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in Real Estate Securities may be subject to specific risks, such as risks to general and local economic conditions, and risks to individual properties.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
High Yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds which have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax  rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund , the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund, the Seligman U.S. Government Securities Fund, and of the Seligman Municipal Funds are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as  much as interest rates in general.  Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance.  The floating rate loans and  securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
 
The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments.  See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
 
Information regarding a Fund's portfolio holdings should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or as an indication that any security is suitable for a particular investor. Monthly portfolio holdings information does not represent an entire portfolio and, in the aggregate, may only represent a small portion of a Fund's total holdings. It should not be assumed that any of the securities, transactions or  holdings listed in the links below were or will be profitable.
