Item 1.01         Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 3, 2009, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC as representatives of the several underwriters therein (collectively, the "Underwriters") providing for the offer and sale by the Company of $300,000,000 principal amount of its 7.30% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Notes").  The Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company.  It also provides for customary indemnification by each of the Company and the Underwriters against certain liabilities and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities.
 
The Notes sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement are governed by the terms of an Indenture, dated as of May 5, 2006, entered into with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank prior to all of the Company's subordinated indebtedness and on an equal basis with all of the Company's other senior unsecured indebtedness.  Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 7.30% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 28 and December 28, commencing December 28, 2009.  The Company may, at any time and from time to time, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part at its option, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice mailed to the holders of the Notes. The Notes will be redeemable at a redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due after the related redemption date but for such redemption (except that, if such redemption date is not an interest payment date, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to the redemption date), discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury rate plus 50 basis points.  Delivery of the Notes in book-entry form only through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company was made on June 8, 2009.
 
The information contained herein is not an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes.  The Company's offer to purchase the Notes is set forth in the prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2009 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 5, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), to the prospectus dated May 26, 2009 (the "Prospectus") and filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on May 26, 2009, as part of our registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-158972).

(jj)           Except as described in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, no Significant Subsidiary of the Company is currently prohibited, directly or indirectly, under any agreement or other instrument to which it is a party or is subject, from paying any dividends to the Company, from making any other distribution on such Significant Subsidiary's capital stock, from repaying to the Company any loans or advances to such Significant Subsidiary from the Company or from transferring any of such Subsidiary's properties or assets to the Company or any other Significant Subsidiary of the Company.
 
(kk)         No forward-looking statement (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act) contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus has been made or reaffirmed without a reasonable basis or has been disclosed other than in good faith.
 
(ll)           Nothing has come to the attention of the Company that has caused the Company to believe that the statistical and market-related data included in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus is not based on or derived from sources that are reliable and accurate in all material respects.
 
(mm)       Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required to be organized or licensed as an insurance company in its jurisdiction of incorporation (including jurisdictions outside of the United States) (each an "
INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY
") has all necessary consents, licenses, authorizations, approvals, exemptions, orders, certificates and permits (collectively, the "
CONSENTS
") of and from, and has made all filings and declarations (collectively, the "
FILINGS
") with, all insurance regulatory authorities, all Federal, state, local and other governmental authorities (including, without limitation, the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Insurance Division), the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the New York Insurance Department), all self-regulatory organizations and all courts and other tribunals, necessary to own, lease, license and use its properties and assets and to conduct its business, except where the failure to have such Consents or to make such Filings would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; all such Consents and Filings are in full force and effect, the Company and its Insurance Subsidiaries are in compliance with such Consents and neither the Company nor any of its Insurance Subsidiaries has received any notice of any inquiry, investigation or proceeding that would reasonably be expected to result in the suspension, revocation or limitation of any such Consent or otherwise impose any limitation on the conduct of the business of the Company or any of its respective Insurance Subsidiaries, except as set forth in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus or except as any such failure to be in full force and effect, failure to be in compliance with, suspension, revocation or limitation would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; each of the Company and its Insurance Subsidiaries is in compliance with, and conducts its businesses in conformity with, all applicable insurance laws and regulations, except where the failure to so
 
comply or conform would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.  Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Insurance Subsidiaries has made all Filings pursuant to, and has obtained all Consents required of all applicable insurance laws and regulations in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes.
 
(nn)         The 2008 statutory annual statements of each Insurance Subsidiary and the statutory balance sheets and income statements included in such statutory annual statements together
with
related schedules and notes have been prepared, in all material respects, in conformity with statutory accounting principles and practices required or permitted by the appropriate insurance regulator of the jurisdiction of domicile of each such Insurance Subsidiary, and such statutory accounting principles and practices have been applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except as may otherwise be indicated therein or in the notes thereto, and present fairly, in all material respects, the statutory financial position of such Insurance Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the statutory basis results of operations of such Insurance Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby.

COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Underwriter that:
 
(a)           The Company will file the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations not later than the Commission's close of business on the second Business Day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b).  The Company will notify the Representatives promptly of any request by the Commission for any amendment of or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; the Company will prepare and file with the Commission, promptly upon the request of the Representatives, any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, may be necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Notes; and the Company will not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Notes by the Underwriters if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, which filing is not consented to by you after reasonable notice thereof.  The Company will advise you, promptly when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes (or is deemed to have become) effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed.  The Company will prepare one or more final term sheets, containing solely a description of the Notes, substantially in the form of Schedule II hereto and approved by the Representatives and file such term sheet or term sheets pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act within the time period prescribed by such Rule.  The Company will advise you promptly of the issuance
by the Commission or any State or other regulatory body of any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, suspending or preventing the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or suspending the qualification of the Notes for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the institution of any proceedings for any such purpose, or of receipt by the Company from the Commission of any notice of objection to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations; and the Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other such order or any such notice of objection and, if a stop order or other such order is issued or any such notice of objection is received, to obtain as soon as possible the lifting or withdrawal thereof.
 
(b)           The Company will furnish to each of you and to counsel for the Underwriters such number of conformed copies of the Registration Statement, as originally filed and each amendment thereto (excluding exhibits other than this Agreement), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to any of such documents (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus), in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(c)           During the period in which the Prospectus relating to the Notes (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Rules and Regulations) is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company will comply with all requirements imposed
 
upon it by the Securities Act and by the Rules and Regulations, as from time to time in force, so far as is necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated by the provisions hereof and by the Prospectus.  If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or file any document to comply with the Securities Act, the Company will promptly notify you and will, subject to Section 4(a) hereof, amend the Registration Statement, amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or file any document (in each case, at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and will furnish without charge to each Underwriter as many written and electronic copies of any such amendment or supplement as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(d)           As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available (which may be by posting on any publicly accessible website maintained by the Commission or the Investor Relations function of the Company) to its security holders and the Underwriters an earning statement satisfying the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations.
 
(e)          
Whether or not this Agreement becomes effective or is terminated or the sale of the Notes to the Underwriters is consummated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid (A) all fees and expenses (including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees and fees and expenses of the Company's accountants but excluding fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters) incurred in connection with the preparation, printing, filing, delivery and shipping of the Registration Statement (including the financial statements therein and all amendments and
exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 filed with the Commission (the "FORM T-1") and any amendments or supplements of the foregoing and any documents incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing, (B) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and delivery to the Underwriters of the Notes (including the cost of printing the Notes), (C) the cost of printing, producing, copying and delivering this Agreement, the Indenture, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other agreements, memoranda, correspondence and other documents printed and delivered in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Notes (but not, however, legal fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with any of the foregoing), (D) all filing fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the qualification of the Notes under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions as provided in Section 4(j) and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including related reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters), (E) any fees required to be paid to rating agencies incurred in connection with the rating of the Notes, (F) the fees, costs and charges of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee, (G) the filing fees incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Notes, and (H) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this
 
Section.  It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 4(e), Section 7 and Section 9 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel and any advertising expenses incurred in connection with any offers they may make.  If the sale of the Notes provided for herein is not consummated by reason of acts of the Company or changes in circumstances of the Company pursuant to Section 9 hereof which prevent this Agreement from becoming effective, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled or if the Underwriters will decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters pursuant to Section 9 or if the Underwriters terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9), the Company will reimburse the several Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and documented disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with any investigation or preparation made by them in respect of the marketing of the Notes or in contemplation of the performance by them of their obligations hereunder.
 
(f)            Until termination of the offering of the Notes, the Company will timely file all documents and amendments to previously filed documents required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 12, 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
(g)           The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
 
(h)           The Company will pay the required Commission filing fees relating to the Notes within the time period required by Rule 456(b)(1) of the Rules and Regulations without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r) of the Rules and Regulations.
 
(i)            If required by Rule 430B(h) of the Rules and Regulations, the Company will prepare a prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and to file such prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations not later than may be required by such Rule; and the Company will make no further amendment or supplement to such prospectus that will be disapproved by the Representatives promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
 
(j)            The Company will cooperate with the Underwriters and with their counsel in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offering and sale by the Underwriters and by dealers under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate and will file such consents to service of process or other documents necessary or appropriate in order to effect such qualification and to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Notes; PROVIDED, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Notes, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
 
(k)           The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Notes to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.
 
(l)            The Company agrees to comply with all the terms and conditions of all agreements set forth in the representation letter of the Company to DTC relating to the approval of the Notes by DTC for "book entry" transfer.
 
(m)          For the period beginning the date of this Agreement through and including the business day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities substantially similar to the Notes.
 
(n)           The Company will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act.
 
5.
                                      
FREE WRITING PROSPECTUSES.
 
(a)           The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Underwriters that it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (other than the Road Show and the Final Term Sheet) without the prior consent of the Representatives; any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Representatives (other than the Road Show) is listed on Schedule II hereto.  The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations with respect to any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not, as of its issue date and through the time the Notes are delivered pursuant to Section 4 hereof, include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when taken together with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, did not, as of the Applicable Time, does not and will not, as of the Closing Date, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
PROVIDED
, that no representation or warranty is made as to information contained in
or omitted from the Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, which information is specified in Section 12.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company and each other Underwriter that it has not made, and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed with the Commission, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives.  The Company also consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (i) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations and (ii) contains only (A) information
 
describing the preliminary terms of the Notes or their offering, (B) information that describes the final terms of the Notes or their offering and that is included in the final term sheet contemplated in Section 4(a) hereof or (C) contains comparable bond price or similar information that (in the case of this clause (C) only) is not "issuer information," as defined in Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations.
 
(c)           The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.

;
 
(v)           This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
(vi)          Each Transaction Document conforms in all material respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
 
(vii)         The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act that has been filed with the Commission not earlier than three years prior to the date of the Underwriting Agreement; each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the subparagraph of Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act specified in such opinion on the date specified therein. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are pending before or threatened by the Commission, and no notice of objection of the
 
Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations has been received by the Company;
 
(viii)        The Registration Statement as of the Effective Date, and the Disclosure Package, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus as of their respective dates and as of the Closing Date, and any further amendments or supplements thereto made by the Company as of their respective issue dates and as of the Closing Date, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (other than the financial statements or notes thereto or other financial data contained therein or omitted therefrom, as to which counsel need express no belief);
 
(ix)           The statements set forth in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities We May Offer" and "Description of the Notes", insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes and the Indenture, and under the caption "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations", insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws referred to therein, are accurate and complete in all material respects; and
 
(x)            The Company is not, nor after giving effect to the offering of the Notes and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described under "Use of Proceeds" in each of the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus will be, an "investment company" or subject to regulation as an "investment company" within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
 
Such opinion shall also contain a statement that such counsel had participated in the preparation of the Registration Statement and Prospectus (but did not participate in the preparation of those portions of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 that are incorporated by reference to the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2009 annual meeting of shareholders) and in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants of the Company, representatives of the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although such counsel has not verified, are not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus (including, in each case, any document filed under the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference therein), nothing has come to such counsel's attention that led them to believe that (i) as of the applicable Effective Date, the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto (other than the financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and the other financial data contained therein or omitted therefrom, the information provided by the Underwriters as specified in Section 12, as to which such counsel need express no belief), including in each case any document filed under the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference therein, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package (other than the financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and the
 
other financial data contained therein or omitted therefrom, the information provided by the Underwriters as specified in Section 12, as to which such counsel need express no belief), including in each case any document filed under the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference therein, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) as of its date and as of the Closing Date, the Prospectus or any supplement or amendment thereto (other than the financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and the other financial data contained therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel need express no belief), including in each case any document filed under the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference therein, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely, without independent verification, as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem appropriate, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and certificates of public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.
 
Such opinion will be limited to the laws of the State of Minnesota, the federal laws of the United States and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and such counsel will express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by such opinion of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
 
(e)           On the Closing Date, you shall have received the opinion (addressed to the Underwriters) of the General Counsel of the Company, dated the Closing Date and in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, to the effect that:
 
(i)            The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the business conducted by it or the location of the properties owned, leased or operated by it makes such qualification necessary
;
 
(ii)           Each of the Company's Significant Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated or formed as a corporation or partnership, as applicable, and is validly existing as a corporation, a general partnership or a limited partnership under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation (and each of the Significant Subsidiaries that is a corporation or a limited partnership is in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation), with full corporate or partnership (as applicable) power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus;
 
(iii)          All outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
 
(iv)          Except as disclosed in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, partnership interests (or such
 
percentage of the partnership interest as is set forth in the respective partnership agreements) or other ownership interests of each Significant Subsidiary are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free and clear of any perfected security interest;
 
(v)           Neither (i) the execution or delivery of the Transaction Documents by the Company, (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, nor (iii) compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Transaction Documents, will, in each case (i), (ii) or (iii), (A) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under the certificate of incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement or other governing documents of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (B) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound, or to which any of their properties is subject, (C) violate any law, rule, administrative regulation or decree of any court, or any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company, its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, or (D) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge, claim or encumbrance upon any property or asset of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, except with respect to (B), (C) and (D), for conflicts, breaches, violations, defaults, liens, charges or encumbrances that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect;
 
(vi)          Neither the filing of the Registration Statement nor the offering or sale of the Notes as contemplated by this Agreement gives rise to any rights, other than those which have been waived or satisfied, for or relating to the registration of any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

(xi)           The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct, as if made at and as of the Closing Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be complied with or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or, to the best of their knowledge, threatened, no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations has been received by the Company, and no order preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus has been

(g)           Since the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereto) and in the most recent Preliminary Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto filed subsequent to the date hereof), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will have sustained any loss by fire, flood, accident or other calamity, or will have become a party to or the subject of any litigation, which is materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, nor will there have been a material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, business or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, regardless of whether arising in the ordinary course of business, which loss, litigation or change, in the judgement of the Representatives, will render it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the payment for and delivery of the Notes.

(j)            Prior to or on the Closing Date, you shall have been furnished by the Company such additional documents and certificates as you or counsel for the Underwriters may reasonably request.

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.
 
(a)           The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Underwriter or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement made by the Company in Section 1 hereof, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (other than in any Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act filed as an exhibit thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations, or any "road show" (as defined in Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations) that does not otherwise constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement (other than in any Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act filed as an exhibit thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any issuer information or any road show a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse each Underwriter or such person promptly after receipt of invoices from such Underwriter or such person for any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such person in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company will not be liable under this Section 7(a) in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, expressly for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, which information is specified in Section 12.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and will reimburse the Company or such person promptly after receipt of invoices from the Company or such person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such person in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such indemnification or reimbursement will be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of such Underwriter, expressly for use therein,
which information is specified in Section 12
.
 
(c)          
Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7.  If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it will notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ a single counsel to represent all of the Underwriters (and to the extent necessary, a single local counsel in each jurisdiction in which proceedings have been brought) who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under such subsection if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are
 
different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company.  No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and such settlement, compromise or consent does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment and such settlement, compromise or consent does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person.
 
(d)           If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d).  The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 7(d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter in respect of the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) 
of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.  Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 7(c) above).
 
(e)          
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
8.
                                      
SUBSTITUTION OF UNDERWRITERS.
 
If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the principal amount of the Notes which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, each non-defaulting Underwriters will be required to purchase (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total principal amount of the Notes less the principal amount of the Notes the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in Schedule I hereto) the principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes if the total principal amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total principal amount of the Notes, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto.  If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to you who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Notes.  If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 7 hereof.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 8.
 
Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.  If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to you are obligated or agree to purchase the Notes of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representatives may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order to effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary.

RESEARCH ANALYST INDEPENDENCE.
 
The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters' research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters' research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the offering of the Notes that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions.  The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions.  The Company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the Company.
 
15.
                                
NO FIDUCIARY DUTY.
 
The Company acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the offering and the sale of the Notes or any other services the Underwriters may be deemed to be providing hereunder, notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by the Underwriters:  (i) no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Company and any other person, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, exists; (ii) the Underwriters are not acting as advisors, expert or otherwise, to the Company, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of the public offering price of the Notes, and such relationship between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, is entirely and solely commercial, based on arm's-length negotiations; (iii) any duties and obligations that the Underwriters may have to the Company shall be limited to those duties and obligations specifically stated herein; and (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach of fiduciary duty in connection with this offering.

Exhibit 5.1
Securities and Exchange Commission
100 F Street, NE
Washington, D.C. 20549
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Ameriprise Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), and I have represented the Registrant in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (333-158972) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the offering from time to time of the securities referred to therein, and a Prospectus Supplement dated June 3, 2009 to the Prospectus dated May 26, 2009 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Registrant under the Registration Statement of up to $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.30% Senior Notes due 2019 of the Registrant (the "Notes").  The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of May 5, 2006 (the "Indenture") entered into by the Registrant and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated June 3, 2009 between the Registrant and the Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement").
 
I or attorneys of the Registrant have examined the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records and documents relating to the Registrant, including resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Registrant (the "Resolutions") and an Officer's Certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Registrant authorizing the issuance, offering and sale of the Notes, and have made such other inquiries of law and fact as we have deemed necessary or relevant as the basis of my opinion hereinafter expressed.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, I am of the opinion that the Notes constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Registrant entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
 
The opinion set forth above is subject to the effects of (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, (b) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (c) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (d) limitations by any governmental authority that limit, delay or prohibit the making of payments outside the United States, and (e) generally applicable laws that (i) provide for the enforcement of oral waivers or modifications where a material change of position in reliance thereon has occurred or provide that a course of performance may operate as a waiver, (ii) limit the availability of a remedy under certain circumstances where another remedy has been elected, (iii) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing, exculpating or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or unlawful conduct, (iv) may, where less than all of a contract may be unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential part of the agreed exchange, (v) govern and afford judicial discretion regarding the determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys' fees and other costs; (vi) may permit a party who has materially failed to render or offer performance required by a contract to cure that failure unless either permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party from making substitute arrangements for performance or it is important under the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance occur by the date stated in the contract; (vii) may limit the enforceability of provisions providing for compounded interest, imposing increased interest rates or late payment charges upon delinquency in payment or default or providing for liquidated damages or for premiums upon acceleration, and (viii) limit the waiver of rights under usury laws. I express no opinion as to whether, or the extent to which, the laws of any particular jurisdiction apply to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the enforceability of the governing law provision contained in the Notes and the Indenture.
 
I have relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Company have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Company, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto (other than the Company) has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto (other than the Company) has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; (vi) there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is no usage of trade or course of dealing among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the agreements or instruments relevant hereto; (vii) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in such jurisdictions; and (viii) all relevant statutes, rules, regulations or agency actions are constitutional and valid unless a
 
reported decision in the Opining Jurisdictions has specifically addressed but not resolved, or has established, its unconstitutionality or invalidity.
 
I am admitted to the practice of law in the States of New York, Minnesota and California and do not purport to be an expert in the laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of New York, Minnesota and California, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and United States federal law.
 
I hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Registrant filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and to use my name under the heading "Validity of the Notes" in the Prospectus, without admitting that I am an "expert" within the meaning of the Act, or other rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit.
