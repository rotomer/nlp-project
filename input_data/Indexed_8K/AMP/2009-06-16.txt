PURCHASE OF THE SHARES BY THE UNDERWRITERS.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions and upon the basis of the representations and warranties herein set forth, (a) the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, the respective number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto at a price per share (the "PURCHASE PRICE") of $24.125, and (b) in the event and to the extent that the Underwriters shall exercise the election to purchase Optional Shares as provided below, the Company agrees to issue and sell to the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase price set forth in clause 2(a) of this Section 2, that portion of the number of Optional Shares as to which such election shall have been exercised (to be adjusted by you so as to eliminate fractional Shares) determined by multiplying such number of Optional Shares by a fraction, the numerator of which is the maximum number of Optional Shares which such Underwriter is entitled to purchase as set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto and the denominator of which is the  maximum number of Optional Shares that all the Underwriters are entitled to purchase hereunder (subject to adjustment by you to avoid fractions).
 
The Company hereby grants to the Underwriters the right to purchase at their election up to 5,400,000 Optional Shares, at the purchase price set forth in clause 2(a) of this Section 2, for the sole purpose of covering sales of Shares in excess of the number of Underwritten Shares.  Any such election to purchase Optional Shares may be exercised only by written notice from you to the Company, given within a period of 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, setting forth the aggregate number of Optional Shares to be purchased and the date at which such Optional Shares are to be delivered, as determined by you but in no event earlier than the First Closing Date or, unless you and the Company otherwise agree in writing, earlier than two or later than ten business days after the date of such notice.  The Underwriters may exercise the right to purchase Optional Shares one or more times until 2:00 P.M., New York
 
City time, on the business day prior to the First Closing Date.  Following the First Closing Date, the Underwriters shall have a one-time right to purchase any Optional Shares remaining after any purchase of Optional Shares on the First Closing Date.  The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any of the Shares, except upon payment for all the Shares to be purchased on such Closing Date as provided herein.  Upon authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Shares, the Underwriters propose to offer the Shares to the public as set forth in the Prospectus. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell the Shares to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Shares purchased by it to or through any Underwriter.

Delivery of the Underwritten Shares (and, if applicable, delivery of the Optional Shares) will be made at the offices of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004 or at such place or places as mutually may be agreed upon by the Company and the Underwriters, (a) with respect to the Underwritten Shares, at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on June 17, 2009 or on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as will be determined by you and the Company (the " FIRST CLOSING DATE") and (b) with respect to the Optional Shares, if any, at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the date specified in the written notice given by you of the Underwriters' election to purchase Optional Shares, or such other time and date as you and the Company may agree upon in writing (such date, if not the First Closing Date, being the "

Any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of the Shares will be paid by the Company.  Delivery of the Shares at the time and place specified in this Agreement is a further condition to the obligations of each Underwriter.

COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.
 
The Company covenants and agrees with each Underwriter that:
 
(a)           The Company will file the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations not later than the Commission's close of business on the second Business Day following the execution and delivery of this Agreement or, if applicable, such earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b).  The Company will notify the Representatives promptly of any request by the Commission for any amendment of or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information; the Company will prepare and file with the Commission, promptly upon the request of the Representatives, any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, may be necessary or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Shares; and the Company will not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file any document under the Exchange Act before the termination of the offering of the Shares by the Underwriters if such document would be deemed to be incorporated by
 
reference into the Prospectus, which filing is not consented to by you after reasonable notice thereof.  The Company will advise you, promptly when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes (or is deemed to have become) effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed.  The Company will advise you promptly of the issuance
by the Commission or any State or other regulatory body of any stop order or other order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, suspending or preventing the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or suspending the qualification of the Shares for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the institution of any proceedings for any such purpose, or of receipt by the Company from the Commission of any notice of objection to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations; and the Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other such order or any such notice of objection and, if a stop order or other such order is issued or any such notice of objection is received, to obtain as soon as possible the lifting or withdrawal thereof.
 
(b)           The Company will furnish to each of you and to counsel for the Underwriters such number of conformed copies of the Registration Statement, as originally filed and each amendment thereto (excluding exhibits other than this Agreement), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements to any of such documents (including any document filed under the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus), in each case as soon as available and in such quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(c)           During the period in which the Prospectus relating to the Shares (or in lieu thereof, the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) of the Rules and Regulations) is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company will comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the Securities Act and by the Rules and Regulations, as from time to time in force, so far as is necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Shares as contemplated by the provisions hereof and by the Prospectus.  If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if during such period it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or file any document to comply with the Securities Act, the Company will promptly notify you and will, subject to Section 4(a) hereof, amend the Registration Statement, amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, or file any document (in each case, at the expense of the Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or to effect such compliance, and will furnish without charge to each Underwriter as many written and electronic copies of any such amendment or supplement as the Representatives may from time to time reasonably request.
 
(d)           As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available (which may be by posting on any publicly accessible website maintained by the Commission or the Investor Relations function of the Company) to its security holders and the Underwriters an earning statement satisfying the requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 of the Rules and Regulations.
 
(e)          
Whether or not this Agreement becomes effective or is terminated or the sale of the Shares to the Underwriters is consummated, the Company will pay or cause to be paid (A) all fees and expenses (including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees and fees and expenses of the Company's accountants but excluding fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters) incurred in connection with the preparation, printing, filing, delivery and shipping of the Registration Statement (including the financial statements therein and all amendments and
exhibits thereto), each Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any amendments or supplements of the foregoing and any documents incorporated by reference into any of the foregoing, (B) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation and delivery to the Underwriters of the Shares (including the cost of printing the Shares), (C) the cost of printing, producing, copying and delivering this Agreement, the closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other agreements, memoranda, correspondence and other documents printed and delivered in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Shares (but not, however, legal fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection with any of the foregoing), (D) all filing fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the qualification of the Shares under the securities laws of the several jurisdictions as provided in Section 4(j) and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including related reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters), (E) the costs of any transfer agent and any registrar, (F) the filing fees incident to, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with, any required review by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. of the terms of the sale of the Shares, and (G) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section.  It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section 4(e), Section 7 and Section 9 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel and any advertising expenses incurred in connection with any offers they may make.  If the sale of the Shares provided for herein is not consummated by reason of acts of the Company or changes in circumstances of the Company pursuant to Section 9 hereof which prevent this Agreement from becoming effective, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled or if the Underwriters will decline to purchase the Shares for any reason permitted under this Agreement (other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters pursuant to Section 9 or if the Underwriters terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9), the Company will reimburse the several Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and documented disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with any investigation or preparation made by them in respect of the marketing of the Shares or in contemplation of the performance by them of their obligations hereunder.
 
(f)            Until termination of the offering of the Shares, the Company will timely file all documents and amendments to previously filed documents required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 12, 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
(g)           The Company will apply the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

(i)            If required by Rule 430B(h) of the Rules and Regulations, the Company will prepare a prospectus in a form approved by the Representatives and file such prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations not later than may be required by such Rule; and the Company will make no further amendment or supplement to such prospectus that will be disapproved by the Representatives promptly after reasonable notice thereof.
 
(j)            The Company will cooperate with the Underwriters and with their counsel in connection with the qualification of the Shares for offering and sale by the Underwriters and by dealers under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Underwriters may designate and will file such consents to service of process or other documents necessary or appropriate in order to effect such qualification and to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of the Shares; PROVIDED, that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Shares, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
 
(k)           The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to cause or result in, or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Stock to facilitate the sale or resale of the Shares.
 
(l)            For a period of 90 days after the date of the Prospectus, the Company will not, (i) offer, pledge, announce the intention to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Commission a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to, any shares of Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Stock or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Stock or such other securities, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, in each case without the prior written consent of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., other than the Shares to be sold hereunder, any shares of Stock of the Company issued upon the exercise of options granted under the stock-based compensation plans of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries and any grants of options, awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units or the issuance of shares of Common Stock of the Company to directors, employees, financial advisors or independent contractors of the Company pursuant to any of the Company's equity plans existing on the date of this Agreement, including the Amended and Restated Ameriprise Financial 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, the Ameriprise Financial Deferred Compensation Plan, the Ameriprise Financial Supplemental Retirement Plan, the Ameriprise Financial Deferred Share Plan for Outside Directors, the Ameriprise Financial Annual Incentive Award Plan, the Ameriprise Financial 2008 Employment Incentive Equity Award Plan, the Amended Deferred Equity Program for Independent Financial Advisors, the Ameriprise Advisor Group Deferred
 
Compensation Plan, the Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Franchise Consultant Growth Bonus Plan, the H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, and the Ameriprise Financial 401(k) Plan.
 
(m)          The Company will, pursuant to reasonable procedures developed in good faith, retain copies of each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus that is not filed with the Commission in accordance with Rule 433 under the Securities Act.

FREE WRITING PROSPECTUSES.
 
(a)           The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Underwriters that it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (other than the Road Show) without the prior consent of the Representatives; and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Representatives (other than the Road Show) is listed on Schedule II hereto.  The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations with respect to any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, including timely filing with the Commission or retention where required and legending; any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not, as of its issue date and through the time the Shares are delivered pursuant to Section 4 hereof, include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, when taken together with the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, did not, as of the Applicable Time, does not and will not, as of the First Closing Date, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
PROVIDED
, that no representation or warranty is made as to information contained in
or omitted from the Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, which information is specified in Section 12.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Company and each other Underwriter that it has not made, and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) required to be filed with the Commission, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives.  The Company also consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (i) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations and (ii) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Shares or their offering.
 
(c)           The Company agrees that if at any time following issuance of an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus any event occurred or occurs as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus would conflict with the information in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or would include an untrue statement of a material fact or
 
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then prevailing, not misleading, the Company will give prompt notice thereof to the Representatives and, if requested by the Representatives, will prepare and furnish without charge to each Underwriter an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or other document which will correct such conflict, statement or omission.

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION.
 
(a)
          
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof), joint or several, to which such Underwriter or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement made by the Company in Section 1 hereof, (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Rules and Regulations, or any "road show" (as defined in Rule 433 of the Rules and Regulations) that does not otherwise constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, or the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any issuer information or any road show a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and will reimburse each Underwriter or such person promptly after receipt of invoices from such Underwriter or such person for any legal or other expenses as reasonably incurred by such Underwriter or such person in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company will not be liable under this Section 7(a) in any such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of the Underwriters, expressly for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, which information is specified in Section 12.
 
(b)
          
Each Underwriter severally, but not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage or liability (or any action in respect thereof) to which the Company or such person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Registration Statement or Prospectus as amended or supplemented, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and will reimburse the Company or such person promptly after receipt of invoices from the Company or such person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or such person in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case such payments will be promptly refunded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such indemnification or reimbursement will be available in each such case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Representatives, on behalf of such Underwriter, expressly for use therein,
which information is specified in Section 12
.
 
(c)
          
Promptly after receipt by any indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7.  If any such claim or action will be brought against any indemnified party, and it will notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party.  After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; except that the Underwriters will have the right to employ a single counsel to represent all of the Underwriters (and to the extent necessary, a single local counsel in each jurisdiction in which proceedings have been brought) who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under such subsection if (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Underwriters will have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Underwriters which are
 
different from or additional to those available to the Company and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is advisable for the Underwriters to employ separate counsel or (iii) the Company has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Underwriters, in which event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be paid by the Company.  No indemnifying party will (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and such settlement, compromise or consent does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment and such settlement, compromise or consent does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified person.
 
(d)
          
If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or 7(b) above, then each indemnifying party will, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 7(a) or 7(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand will be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.  Relative fault will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d).  The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in the first sentence of this Section 7(d) will be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this Section 7(d).  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7(d), no Underwriter will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter in respect of the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to investors exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) 
of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.  Each party entitled to contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect to which contribution may be sought, it will promptly give written notice of such service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service will not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought for any obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise (except as specifically provided in Section 7(c) above).
 
(e)
          
The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
8.
                                      
SUBSTITUTION OF UNDERWRITERS.
 
If, on a Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in its obligation to purchase the number of Shares which it has agreed to purchase under this Agreement, each non-defaulting Underwriters will be required to purchase (in the respective proportions which the number of Shares set forth opposite the name of each non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule I hereto bears to the total number of Shares less the number of Shares the defaulting Underwriter agreed to purchase set forth in Schedule I hereto) the number of Shares which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase; except that the non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase any of the Shares if the total number of Shares which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceed 9.09% of the total number of Shares, and any non-defaulting Underwriters will not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of Shares set forth opposite its name in Schedule I hereto.  If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, and any other underwriters satisfactory to you who so agree, will have the right, but will not be obligated, to purchase (in such proportions as may be agreed upon among them) all of the Shares.  If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to the Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Shares that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the indemnity and contribution agreements of the Company and the Underwriters contained in Section 7 hereof.  As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter pursuant to this Section 8.
 
Nothing contained herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have for damages caused by its default.  If the non-defaulting Underwriters or the other underwriters satisfactory to you are obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, the Representatives may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full Business Days in order to effect any changes that may be necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other document or agreement, and to file promptly any amendments or any supplements to the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made necessary.
 
9.
                                      
TERMINATION.
 
Until the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by you by giving notice as hereinafter provided to the Company if (a) the Company will have failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder; (b) any of the events described in Sections 6(l) and 6(m), shall have occurred; or (c) any other condition to the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled.  Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 will be without liability on the part of the Company or any Underwriter, except as otherwise provided in Sections 4(e) and 8 hereof.
 
Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section 11 hereof in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or telephone, will be immediately confirmed in writing.

SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.
 
The agreements contained in Section 7 hereof and the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company contained in Sections 1 and 4 hereof will survive the delivery of the Shares to the Underwriters hereunder and will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions.  The Company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the Company.
 
15.
                                
NO FIDUCIARY DUTY.
 
The Company acknowledges and agrees that in connection with the offering and the sale of the Shares or any other services the Underwriters may be deemed to be providing hereunder, notwithstanding any preexisting relationship, advisory or otherwise, between the parties or any oral representations or assurances previously or subsequently made by the Underwriters:  (i) no fiduciary or agency relationship between the Company and any other person, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, exists; (ii) the Underwriters are not acting as advisors, expert or otherwise, to the Company, including, without limitation, with respect to the determination of the public offering price of the Shares, and such relationship between the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, is entirely and solely commercial, based on arm's-length negotiations; (iii) any duties and obligations that the Underwriters may have to the Company shall be limited to those duties and obligations specifically stated herein; and (iv) the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may have interests that differ from those of the Company.  The Company hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any breach of fiduciary duty in connection with this offering.

Exhibit 5.1
June 16, 2009
 
Securities and Exchange Commission
100 F Street, NE
Washington, D.C. 20549
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Ameriprise Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), and I have represented the Registrant in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (333-158972) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), relating to the offering from time to time of the securities referred to therein, and a Prospectus Supplement dated June 11, 2009 to the Prospectus dated May 26, 2009 (together, the "Prospectus") relating to the offer and sale by the Registrant under the Registration Statement of up to 41,400,000 shares of common stock of the Registrant (the "Shares").  The Shares are to be issued and sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated June 11, 2009 between the Registrant and the Underwriters named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement").
 
I, or attorneys of the Registrant, have examined the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records and documents relating to the Registrant, including resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Registrant (the "Resolutions") and an Officer's Certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Registrant authorizing the issuance, offering and sale of the Shares, and have made such other inquiries of law and fact as we have deemed necessary or relevant as the basis of my opinion hereinafter expressed.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, I am of the opinion that the Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
 
I have relied, without investigation, upon the following assumptions: (i) natural persons acting on behalf of the Registrant have sufficient legal capacity to enter into and perform, on behalf of the Registrant, the transaction in question; (ii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto (other than the Registrant) has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto (other than the Registrant) has complied with all legal requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Registrant; (iv) each document submitted to me for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine; (v) there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or
 
 
misunderstanding, fraud, duress or undue influence; (vi) there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or oral, and there is no usage of trade or course of dealing among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement or qualify the agreements or instruments relevant hereto; (vii) all statutes, judicial and administrative decisions, and rules and regulations of governmental agencies, constituting the law of the opining jurisdictions, are publicly available to lawyers practicing in such jurisdictions; and (viii) all relevant statutes, rules, regulations or agency actions are constitutional and valid unless a reported decision in the opining jurisdictions has specifically addressed but not resolved, or has established, its unconstitutionality or invalidity.
 
I am admitted to the practice of law in the States of New York, Minnesota and California and do not purport to be an expert in the laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of New York, Minnesota and California, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and United States federal law.
 
I hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K of the Registrant filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and to use my name under the heading "Validity of the Common Stock" in the Prospectus, without admitting that I am an "expert" within the meaning of the Act, or other rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this exhibit.
