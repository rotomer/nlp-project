MINNEAPOLIS  July 1, 2009  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today announced that it has commenced a fixed price cash tender offer to purchase up to $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.35% Senior Notes due November 15, 2010 (the "Notes"). The terms and conditions of the tender offer are described in the Offer to Purchase, dated as of July 1, 2009, and the related Letter of Transmittal.
 
 
*              Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase.
 
The tender offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. New York City time on July 29, 2009, unless extended. Subject to the terms and conditions of the tender offer, Ameriprise Financial expects to pay for Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on the business day after the date on which the tender offer expires.
 
Holders must tender their Notes by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on July 15, 2009, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the total consideration (which includes the early tender payment set forth above). Holders who tender their Notes after such time but prior to the expiration of the tender offer will be eligible to receive the total consideration less the early tender payment.
 
In addition, payments for Notes purchased pursuant to the tender offer will include accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date to, but not including, the settlement date.
 
Except in limited circumstances set forth in the Offer to Purchase, withdrawal rights for the tender offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on July 15, 2009, unless extended. The tender offer is subject to certain customary conditions, but is not conditioned upon any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered.
 
Ameriprise Financial has retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. to serve as the lead dealer manager for the tender offer and Utendahl Capital Group, LLC to serve as the co-dealer manager for the tender offer. Ameriprise Financial also has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to serve as the depositary and as the information agent for the tender offer.

The tender offer is made only by and pursuant to the terms of the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal. The tender offer is not being made to holders in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would be unlawful.
