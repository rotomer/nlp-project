Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On October 21, 2009, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2009.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2009.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that reflect certain after-tax market related impacts and our integration charges. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: core operating earnings; core operating earnings, after-tax; net investment (gains)/losses, after-tax; integration charges, after-tax; DAC and DSIC charges, after-tax; variable annuity guarantees, net of DAC and DSIC, after-tax; RiverSource 2a-7 money market funds support costs, after-tax; expenses related to unaffiliated money market funds, after-tax; debt retirement costs, after-tax; pretax segment income (loss) margin; pretax return on allocated equity; pretax return on allocated equity for pretax segment income (loss) excluding net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests; pretax income (loss) margin; net income (loss) attributable to Ameriprise Financial margin; pretax operating earnings; and pretax operating earnings margin. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our 2009 and 2008 operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures were used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," as revised, and non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sarl, consolidated in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-5, "Determining whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights." Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure.  In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  October 21, 2009  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $260 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss of $70 million for the third quarter of 2008. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2009 were $1.00, compared to a loss of $0.32 a year ago.
 
Core operating earnings were $268 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $251 million a year ago, a 7 percent increase (see summary table on page 2). Core operating earnings per share declined to $1.03 in the third quarter of 2009 from $1.13 a year ago. Excluding 36 million shares the company issued to pre-fund its acquisition, core operating earnings per share were $1.19, up 5 percent from the prior year.
 
Core operating earnings reflect lower equity markets and the cost of maintaining high liquidity levels, substantially offset by growth in spread products and re-engineering benefits. In addition, year-over-year growth reflects a net $0.02 per share benefit from favorable adjustments from updating valuation assumptions (unlocking) in both periods.
 
Net revenues increased 20 percent to $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2009, compared to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Revenue growth reflects the year-over-year improvement in net investment income, primarily driven by net investment losses in the prior year.
 
The company continues to achieve re-engineering expense savings. During the quarter, the company recognized approximately $120 million in re-engineering benefits and is on pace to exceed $350 million in re-engineering expense benefits for full-year 2009.
 
As of September 30, 2009, the company's excess capital position was more than $2 billion, including $1 billion from the company's decision to pre-fund its acquisition. As of September 30, 2009, the company had $0.8 billion in net unrealized investment gains, reflecting the quality and diversity of its investment portfolio. Book value per share increased to $34.97.
 
"As our results demonstrate, we're beginning to see a return of the earnings power inherent in our diversified model," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "The fundamentals of our business are improving slowly but steadily, with new client growth and improved asset levels and product flows. This increasing business momentum, along with our continued focus on delivering re-engineering savings to the bottom line, provides important earnings leverage for the future.
 
"We also expect meaningful contributions from our pending acquisition of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business. As we work through the initial phases of our integration planning, we remain confident that the acquisition will fit well with our culture, and that we will be able to generate the financial benefits that we have projected."
 
 
Third Quarter 2009 Summary
 
Management believes the exclusion of certain after-tax impacts, such as realized net investment gains/losses, non-recurring integration costs and other market impacts listed below best reflects the underlying performance of the business. For the non-GAAP presentation of after-tax amounts, the tax effect is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.

For this non-GAAP presentation, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
(2)
         
Diluted shares used in this calculation represent basic shares due to the net loss. Using actual diluted shares would result in anti-dilution.
 
The following items are excluded from core operating earnings in the third quarter of 2009. Each impact is presented after tax.
 
                 
$9 million benefit, or $0.03 per share, in net realized investment gains, comprising $36 million in realized investment gains, partially offset by $27 million in realized investment losses and other-than-temporary impairments on corporate bonds and previously impaired non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, as well as reserves for commercial mortgage loans.
 
                 
$21 million expense, or $0.08 per share, comprising $18 million in integration costs from 2008 acquisitions and $3 million associated with the company's agreement to acquire the long-term asset management business of Columbia Management.
 
                 
$18 million benefit, or $0.07 per share, from lower deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) amortization due to favorable market conditions in the quarter.
 
                 
$1 million benefit from variable annuity guarantees, consisting of:
 
                 
$17 million expense, or $0.07 per share, net of DAC and DSIC, resulting from the impact of the credit default spread on the SFAS 157 valuation of living benefit liabilities.
                 
$18 million benefit, or $0.07 per share, net of DAC and DSIC, from living benefit guarantees and the favorable impact of equity market appreciation on death benefits.
 
                 
$7 million expense, or $0.02 per share, in RiverSource 2a-7 money market fund support costs.
 
                 
$8 million expense, or $0.03 per share, related to the early retirement of $450 million of the company's notes due in 2010.
 
Core operating earnings for the third quarter of 2009 included an $87 million, or $0.33 per share, after-tax unlocking benefit from updating valuation assumptions, compared to a $69 million, or $0.31 per share, after-tax unlocking benefit in the prior year from updating valuation assumptions and the implementation of a new actuarial valuation system. While the year-over-year change to pretax earnings was $28 million, the benefit was the result of a $162 million year-over-year reduction in revenues combined with a $190 million reduction in expenses.
 
The third quarter of 2009 also included a $7 million, or $0.03 per share, after-tax reserve related to a previously disclosed client mediation.
 
In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2008, core operating earnings included estimated negative impacts of $0.18 per share from the market-driven decline in asset-based fees and $0.11 per share from maintaining high liquidity levels and lower cash product spreads.
 
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2009
 
The company continues to maintain strong balance sheet fundamentals, excess capital and financial flexibility to capture additional growth opportunities.
 
Conservative capital management

The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk. The variable annuity hedging program continues to perform well.

Third Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
                 
The company announced a definitive agreement to acquire the long-term asset management business of Columbia Management for approximately $1 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed in the spring of 2010. The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings and ROE within one year, based on Institutional Brokers' Estimate System (I/B/E/S) estimates just prior to the announcement.
 
                 
Total advisors increased 8 percent to 12,314 compared to the third quarter of 2008, reflecting acquisitions, experienced advisor recruiting and continued strong advisor retention rates.
 
                 
Owned, managed and administered assets were $440 billion as of September 30, 2009, up 12 percent compared to September 30, 2008, primarily due to strong product flows, bond market appreciation and recent acquisitions, partially offset by the 9 percent decline in the S&P 500 compared to the prior year. On a sequential basis, owned, managed and administered assets grew 11 percent, primarily reflecting equity and bond market appreciation during the quarter and retail net inflows.
 
                 
Client activity continued to improve, with solid asset flows across product lines.
 
                 
Wrap net inflows of $2.7 billion in the quarter and market appreciation increased total wrap assets to more than $89 billion, a 7 percent increase compared to the prior year.
 
                 
Total Asset Management net inflows were $2.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting improved flows at both RiverSource and Threadneedle. Year-to-date 2009 Asset Management net inflows reached $2.2 billion, compared to net outflows of $19.3 billion for the first three quarters of 2008.
 
                 
Total annuity net inflows in the quarter were $0.5 billion, resulting almost entirely from variable annuity net inflows.
 
                 
The company introduced new product solutions in the quarter, including

 investments, which provide individuals access to alternative strategies often reserved for institutional investors.
 
                 
Life insurance in force was $193 billion as of the end of the third quarter of 2009, which was essentially flat compared to a year ago, consistent with the slow sales environment for the industry. Over the past two quarters, universal life sales have increased steadily, offsetting flat sales in variable universal life.
 
                 
Ameriprise Auto & Home premiums increased 6 percent from the prior year, primarily due to growth in policy counts.
 
                 
The company generated approximately $120 million in re-engineering expense savings in the quarter, primarily from enhanced operational efficiencies. As of the end of the third quarter, the company generated approximately $290 million in year-to-date re-engineering expense savings and is on pace to exceed $350 million in savings for full-year 2009.

Third Quarter 2009 Consolidated Results
 
The company reported net income of $260 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to a net loss of $70 million for the third quarter of 2008. Core operating earnings increased $17 million, or 7 percent, to $268 million.
 
Revenues
 
Total net revenues increased 20 percent, or $321 million, to $2.0 billion compared to a year ago. Core net revenues declined $38 million, or 2 percent, driven by a $162 million decline in revenues from unlocking, which were more than offset by reduced expenses from unlocking. The impact of lower equity markets on fee revenue was more than offset by increased net investment income from growth in spread products and revenues from recent acquisitions.
 
Management and financial advice fees declined 4 percent, or $32 million, to $689 million, driven by a 21 percent decline in the daily average S&P 500 on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by net inflows. On a sequential basis, management and financial advice fees increased 14 percent, or $83 million, reflecting equity market appreciation in the quarter, and asset management and advisor-managed wrap account inflows.
 
Distribution fees declined 2 percent, or $9 million, to $367 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower asset-based fees driven by lower equity markets. On a sequential basis, distribution fees increased 5 percent, or $16 million, reflecting equity market appreciation in the quarter and modest increases in advisor productivity levels.
 
Net investment income increased to $542 million compared to $62 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Core net investment income increased 34 percent, or $133 million, to $528 million, driven by higher invested assets levels, primarily from spread product net inflows and higher yields on the longer-term investments in the company's investment portfolio.
 
Premiums increased 5 percent, or $12 million, to $276 million, primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums compared to the prior year, as the business continues to increase sales through the Ameriprise advisor channel.
 
Other revenues declined 56 percent, or $140 million, to $109 million, primarily due to a $65 million negative impact from unlocking in the third quarter of 2009, compared to a $95 million benefit from unlocking in the prior year.
 
Banking and deposit interest expense declined 23 percent, or $10 million, to $33 million, primarily due to lower crediting rates on certificates and deposit products, partially offset by a 17 percent year-over-year increase in on-balance sheet deposits.
 
Expenses
 
Expenses declined 11 percent, or $195 million, to $1.6 billion. Core expenses decreased 4 percent, or $74 million, to $1.6 billion. Core expenses included ongoing expenses related to the 2008 acquisitions and higher average crediting rates on fixed accounts, offset by the impact of unlocking and re-engineering and cost controls.
 
Distribution expenses increased 1 percent, or $5 million, to $466 million, reflecting the company's 2008 acquisitions, partially offset by lower activity levels.
 
Interest credited to fixed accounts increased 16 percent, or $32 million, to $232 million, reflecting higher annuity fixed account balances and higher average crediting rates compared to the prior year.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 56 percent, or $110 million, to $306 million.
Core benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 21 percent, or $45 million, to $258 million, primarily driven by increased auto and home benefits from higher business volumes, higher variable annuity death and living benefit expenses and the impact of unlocking.
 
Amortization of DAC was a net benefit of $64 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to a $240 million expense in the prior year. Core expenses in this line were $12 million, a decrease of $176 million compared to the prior year. Unlocking resulted in reduced amortization of $119 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared to additional amortization of $81 million in the prior year.
 
General and administrative expense decreased 8 percent, or $56 million, to $625 million, compared to a year ago. Excluding an estimated $63 million in ongoing costs from acquisitions, core general and administrative expenses declined 8 percent compared to a year ago, reflecting re-engineering benefits and cost controls.
 
Taxes
 
During the third quarter of 2009, the company increased its profit expectation for 2009 and revised its full-year effective tax rate to approximately 22 percent from 20 percent as of June 30, 2009. As a result, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2009 was 23.7 percent to reflect the catch-up for the prior quarters.

Excluding integration charges and net realized  investment gains, segment core operating earnings were $28 million in the third quarter of 2009, down $29 million compared to the prior year.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).  This report includes information on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
This report contains certain non-GAAP measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include:
Pretax income (loss) margin and Pretax segment income (loss) margin;
Net income (loss) attributable to Ameriprise Financial margin;
Pretax return on allocated equity;
Total debt excluding non-recourse debt;
Total debt excluding non-recourse debt and 75% equity credit;
Total capital excluding non-recourse debt;
Debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt;
Debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and 75% equity credit;
Pretax operating earnings; and
Pretax operating earnings margin.
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.  These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
The Company presents debt to capital ratios excluding non-recourse debt of structured entities consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R),  EITF 04-5 and other accounting literature and with a 75% equity credit for the Company's junior subordinated debt.  Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this non-recourse debt better represent the Company's capital structure.

Rankings based on annualized total returns, excluding sales charges.  Net asset value (NAV) returns for all periods would have been lower if the applicable sales charges were included.
 
Please note the following about the "Ranking since" Lipper Rankings: In order to obtain a more accurate "since inception" Lipper Ranking for funds with an inception prior to 2000, the Thursday or month-end date following the actual inception date was used, rather than the actual inception date.  When researching since inception rankings, please use the "Ranking Since" date.
 
Please note the following about the "Annualized Returns @ POP":  The POP return is calculated assuming a one-time purchase of the Fund at the maximum sales charge listed in the exhibit.  RiverSource S&P 500 Index Fund has no sales loads, however, a redemption fee of 0.50% is charged on shares redeemed within 180 days of purchase.
 
Net assets per fund include all share classes.  Assets for RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are invested in other RiverSource Funds and therefore would be double counted if assets are summed to reach a total.
 
Fee waivers were in place for each subadvised fund shown and the return would have been lower for each Fund had fee waivers not been in place.
 
An investment in money market funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although these funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of mutual funds carefully before investing.

The RiverSource Global Technology Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risk and potential volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.
 
The RiverSource Precious Metals and Mining Fund is a narrowly focused sector fund and it may exhibit higher volatility than funds with broader investment objectives.
 
Investments in Real Estate Securities may be subject to specific risks, such as risks to general and local economic conditions, and risks to individual properties.
 
International investing involves increased risk and volatility, not typically associated with domestic investing, due to changes in currency exchange rates, foreign government regulations, differences in auditing and accounting standards, potential political and economic instability, limited liquidity and volatile prices. The risks of international investing are particularly significant in emerging markets.
 
There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade securities have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
High Yield funds invest in lower-rated bonds which have more volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment grade securities.
 
Principal risks associated with the RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund include style risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and sector/concentration risk. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The U.S. government guarantee applies only to the underlying TIPS securities, and not the Fund itself.
 
Income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal income tax rules will apply to any capital gains distribution.
 
Shares of the RiverSource Short Duration U.S. Government Fund, the RiverSource U.S. Government Mortgage Fund, the Seligman U.S. Government Securities Fund, and of the Seligman Municipal Funds are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.
 
The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The principal risks of investing in the fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall, however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates do not rise as much as interest rates in general.  Limited liquidity may affect the ability of the fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a negative impact on fund performance.  The floating rate loans and securities in which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund.
 
The RiverSource Portfolio Builder Funds, RiverSource Income Builder Funds and RiverSource Retirement Plus Funds are "funds of funds" comprised of holdings in several different RiverSource funds, which may include small cap, mid cap, large cap, money market, international, bond and/or other sector funds. Specific risk considerations are discussed in each fund's prospectus. Each of the underlying funds in which the portfolio invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of each portfolio's shares and investments.  See each fund's prospectus for specific risks that may be associated with the underlying funds.
 
The Funds listed here are actively managed and their holdings are subject to change. There can be no assurance that the securities set forth in the links below have remained or will remain in a Fund's portfolio. Information regarding a Fund's portfolio holdings should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or as an indication that any security is suitable for a particular investor. Monthly portfolio holdings information does not represent an entire portfolio and, in the aggregate, may only represent a small portion of a Fund's total holdings. It should not be assumed that any of the securities, transactions or holdings listed in the links below were or will be profitable.
 
Fund returns for Seligman Capital Fund prior to September 26, 2002 do not reflect the increased management fee effective on such date. This fee, if reflected, would reduce the performance data quoted for the Fund for such periods. Seligman is waiving all or part of its investment management fee and/or reimbursing Fund expenses for Seligman California High-Yield Municipal Fund, Seligman Florida Municipal Fund, Seligman Frontier Fund, Seligman Core Fixed Income Fund, Seligman LaSalle Global Real Estate Fund, Seligman LaSalle Monthly Dividend Real Estate Fund, Seligman Emerging Markets Fund, Seligman Global Growth Fund, Seligman International Growth Fund, Seligman TargETFund Core, Seligman TargETFund 2015, Seligman TargETFund 2025, Seligman TargETFund 2035, Seligman TargETFund 2045, Seligman Asset Allocation Aggressive Growth Fund, Seligman Asset Allocation Growth Fund, Seligman Asset Allocation Moderate Growth Fund, Seligman Asset Allocation Balanced Fund. In addition, from time to time, Seligman has reimbursed expenses or waived investment management fees of other Seligman Mutual Funds. Seligman may implement or discontinue voluntary expense reimbursements or fee waivers at any time. Absent such reimbursement/waivers, returns would have been lower.
 
Dividends paid by Seligman LaSalle Monthly Dividend Real Estate Fund generally will be taxable as ordinary income. It is expected that income dividends paid by the Fund generally will not be eligible for the reduction in dividend tax rates set forth in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.
 
The four funds within the Seligman Asset Allocation Series and Seligman TargetHorizon ETF Portfolios
SM
 invest in the Seligman Mutual Funds (Underlying Seligman Funds) and exchange traded funds (ETFs), respectively, to implement their unique asset allocation strategies. Investments in the underlying Seligman Funds or ETFs involve risk, including the risk of loss of principal. An investor in a Fund within the Seligman Asset Allocation Series or Seligman TargetHorizon ETF Portfolios
SM
 will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the Underlying Seligman Funds or ETFs, as applicable, in which the Fund invests.  Thus, the expenses borne by the investor will be higher than if he or she invested directly in the Underlying Seligman Funds or ETFs, and the returns may therefore be lower.
