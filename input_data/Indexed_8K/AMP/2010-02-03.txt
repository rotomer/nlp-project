Item 2.02               Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On February 3, 2010, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2009.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude items that reflect certain after-tax market related impacts and our integration charges. Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: core operating earnings; core operating earnings, after-tax; investment (gains)/losses, after-tax; restructuring and integration charges, after-tax; DAC and DSIC (benefits)/charges, after-tax; variable annuity guarantees, net of DAC and DSIC, after-tax; RiverSource 2a-7 money market funds support costs, after-tax; expenses related to unaffiliated money market funds, after-tax; debt retirement costs, after-tax; pretax segment income(loss) margin; return on allocated equity; pretax income (loss) margin; net income (loss) attributable to Ameriprise Financial margin; pretax operating earnings; and pretax operating earnings margin. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of our 2009 and 2008 operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures were used for goal setting, certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program and evaluating our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 debt to capital ratios that exclude the effect of a consolidated nonrecourse collateralized debt obligation and consolidated non-recourse debt of certain property fund limited partnerships managed by our subsidiary, Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sarl. Management believes that the debt to capital ratios, excluding this non-recourse debt, better represent our capital structure.  In addition, we provide debt to capital ratio information that reflects an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006. These junior subordinated notes receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  February 3, 2010 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $237 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a net loss of $369 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $0.90 compared to a loss of $1.69 per share a year ago.
 
Fourth quarter 2009 net income was driven by increased asset-based fees from market appreciation,  net inflows in wrap accounts and Asset Management, higher income from spread products and re-engineering benefits.  Excluding the broad negative impacts of the equity and credit market dislocation from earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008, core operating earnings grew 36 percent year-over-year, driven by business growth and market improvement.
 
Net revenues increased 70 percent to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $2.0 billion sequentially.  Excluding net realized gains/(losses) and increased loan reserves from both periods and other credit-related impacts in the fourth quarter of 2008, net revenues increased 28 percent from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher asset-based fees from net inflows and market appreciation, as well as higher investment yields and increased general account balances.
 
The company achieved more than $120 million in re-engineering benefits in the fourth quarter of 2009 and exceeded $400 million in re-engineering benefits for the year.  Underlying fourth quarter 2009 expenses remained well controlled.
 
As of December 31, 2009, the company's excess capital position was more than $2 billion, which included approximately $1 billion for the company's pending acquisition of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business.  As of December 31, 2009, the company had $0.7 billion in net unrealized investment gains, reflecting the quality and diversity of its investment portfolio.  Book value per share increased to $35.82 at year-end, up from $34.97 at September 30, 2009 and $28.29 a year ago.
 
Return on equity for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 was 9.3 percent, which includes the June 2009 issuance of approximately $1 billion in equity for the pending Columbia Management acquisition.
 
"We generated solid results in the quarter, aided by the improved market conditions and the strength of our diversified business model," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "While the market environment and economy remain challenging, client activity and advisor productivity began to improve, and I am pleased with the trends in our metrics.  Our asset flows have improved considerably, with strong net inflows in wrap accounts and our asset management business.
 
"We continue to invest for growth, including our pending Columbia Management acquisition.  We're making steady progress toward completing the transaction, and I remain confident that the cultural fit and complementary investment capabilities of the two organizations will create a strong asset manager."
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Highlights
 
                 
Owned, managed and administered assets reached $458 billion at December 31, 2009, a 23 percent increase from a year ago, primarily due to market appreciation and strong product flows.
 
                 
Total retail client assets increased 22 percent to $294 billion, compared to a year ago, and client retention remained strong at 93 percent.
 
                 
Net revenue per financial advisor increased for the fourth consecutive quarter, to $73,000, the highest level since the second quarter of 2008.
 
                 
Total advisors declined 4 percent year-over-year to 12,036, primarily from low-producing advisors' inability to meet productivity requirements.  Franchise advisor retention rates remain strong, and the company recruited more than 500 experienced advisors in its branded channels during 2009.
 
                 
The company delivered strong hedge fund performance in 2009, primarily in Seligman portfolios, which generated a $30 million net pretax benefit in the quarter.
 
                 
Total managed assets reached $326 billion, an increase of 23 percent from a year ago, driven by market appreciation and solid asset flows across product lines.
 
                 
Wrap net inflows of $2.6 billion in the quarter and market appreciation increased total wrap assets to approximately $95 billion, a 30 percent increase compared to a year ago.
 
                 
Asset Management generated total net inflows of $1.4 billion in the quarter, with net inflows in both domestic and international businesses.
 
                 
Variable annuity net inflows were $0.4 billion in the quarter.
 
                 
Life insurance in force was $193 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, which was essentially flat compared to a year ago, consistent with the slow sales environment for the industry.
 
                 
Fourth quarter 2009 variable universal life sales, which had remained flat for the first three quarters of 2009, increased 21 percent sequentially.  Fourth quarter 2009 universal life sales more than doubled compared to the year-ago period.
 
                 
Ameriprise Auto & Home premiums increased 7 percent from the year-ago period, primarily due to growth in policy counts.
 
                 
The company expects to complete the acquisition of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business in the spring of 2010.  Operational and financial expectations are on track.
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Summary
 
Management provides core financial measures, which exclude certain after-tax impacts such as realized net investment gains/(losses), non-recurring integration costs and other market impacts listed below, to facilitate year-over-year comparisons and evaluate business trends.  For the non-GAAP presentation of after-tax amounts, the tax effect is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35 percent.

For this non-GAAP presentation, after-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
(2)
                        
Diluted shares used in this calculation represent basic shares due to the net loss. Using actual diluted shares would result in anti-dilution.
 
Fourth quarter 2008 net income included broad negative impacts from the credit market dislocation as detailed above.  The net impact of these items in the fourth quarter of 2009 was immaterial.  Management believes the reported $0.90 net income per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009 reflected the underlying strength of the business.
 
In addition to the items in the table above, fourth quarter 2009 earnings included the following unusual expense items: a $12 million after-tax charge, or $0.05 per diluted share, from the final settlement of a client dispute and a $9 million after-tax charge, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to updated valuation assumptions for insurance claim reserves.
 
Full Year 2009 Summary
 
For the year, the company reported net income of $722 million, or $2.95 per diluted share, on net revenues of $7.8 billion.  This compares to a net loss of $38 million, or $0.17 per share, on net revenues of $6.9 billion in 2008.   Adjusted for extraordinary market-related impacts, as well as restructuring and integration charges, 2009 core operating earnings were $769 million, compared to $889 million for 2008.  The decline in 2009 core operating earnings was primarily due to the impact of the 22 percent decline in the daily average S&P 500 Index on fee-based revenues, lower short-term interest rates and lower client activity.  These factors were partially offset by growth in spread products, net inflows in wrap accounts and Asset Management, and expense controls.

The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk.  The variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well.

Fourth Quarter 2009 Consolidated Results
 
The company reported net income of $237 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to a net loss of $369 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Fourth quarter 2009 net earnings were driven by increased asset-based fees from market appreciation, net inflows in wrap accounts and Asset Management, higher income from spread products and re-engineering benefits.  Excluding the broad negative impacts of the equity and credit market dislocation in the fourth quarter of 2008, core operating earnings grew 36 percent, driven by strong underlying business growth.
 
Revenues
 
Total net revenues increased 70 percent, or $934 million, to $2.3 billion, compared to a year ago.  The fourth quarter of 2008 included $420 million in pre-tax realized net investment losses.  Core net revenues increased $496 million, or 28 percent, to $2.3 billion, reflecting growth in spread products and yields, higher asset-based fees due to growth in assets from market appreciation, net inflows and strong hedge fund performance.
 
Management and financial advice fees increased 41 percent, or $248 million, to $855 million, driven by a 20 percent year-over-year increase in the daily average S&P 500 Index, higher hedge fund performance fees, and net inflows in Asset Management and advisor-managed wrap accounts.
 
Distribution fees increased 17 percent, or $57 million, to $391 million, primarily reflecting equity market appreciation in the quarter and increased per advisor productivity.
 
Net investment income was $535 million, an increase of $567 million from a loss a year ago.  Excluding net realized gains in the fourth quarter of 2009 and net realized losses in the year-ago period, core net investment income/(loss) increased 33 percent, or $129 million, to $517 million, primarily driven by net inflows in fixed annuities and higher yields on longer-term fixed income investments in the company's investment portfolio.
 
Premiums increased 6 percent, or $16 million, to $287 million, primarily due to growth in auto and home premiums as the business increased sales through Ameriprise advisors and direct channels.
 
Other revenues increased 13 percent, or $27 million, to $229 million.  In the 2009 quarter, other revenues included $43 million from consolidated managed property funds, which was entirely offset by related expenses and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.  The fourth quarter of 2008 included $36 million in proceeds from the sale of certain operating assets and $19 million from the repurchase of a portion of the company's junior subordinated securities.  Business growth was primarily driven by increased variable annuity rider fees.
 
Banking and deposit interest expense declined 40 percent, or $19 million, to $28 million, primarily due to lower crediting rates on certificates and deposit products.
 
Expenses
 
Total expenses declined 3 percent, or $68 million, to $1.9 billion, compared to a year ago.  The fourth quarter of 2008 included $419 million in additional expenses, primarily as a result of the market dislocation.  Fourth quarter 2009 total expenses reflected business growth, the impact of acquisitions, increased performance-based compensation and investments in the business, partially offset by re-engineering benefits and cost controls.
 
Distribution expenses increased 22 percent, or $91 million, to $504 million, reflecting equity market appreciation and improved advisor productivity.
 
Interest credited to fixed accounts increased 13 percent, or $26 million, to $229 million, reflecting higher annuity fixed account balances and higher average crediting rates compared to a year ago.
 
Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 5 percent, or $18 million, to $349 million.
 
Core benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 12 percent, or $38 million, to $344 million, primarily driven by updated valuation assumptions for insurance claim reserves and higher auto and home loss costs from increased business volumes and weather-related losses.
 
Amortization of DAC declined 70 percent, or $275 million, to $120 million.  The 2008 quarter included $315 million in amortization from lower equity market levels, primarily from unlocking equity market assumptions.  Core amortization of DAC was $124 million, an increase of $44 million compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher expected profits from the annuities business.
 
General and administrative expense increased 11 percent, or $72 million, to $708 million.  Higher expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were primarily driven by hedge fund performance compensation and the year-over-year increase in the company's performance compensation pool, primarily due to the reversal of prior accruals in the 2008 quarter from the unexpected downturn in profitability.  In addition, the fourth quarter of 2009 included higher legal expenses and a full three months of expenses from entities acquired in November 2008.  The year-ago quarter included a restructuring charge.  Adjusting for these items, the company achieved its 10 percent expense reduction target for the full year.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income, including net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, was 17.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 19.9 percent for the full year.  The company expects the effective tax rate to increase in 2010 to approximately 28 to 30 percent due to higher expected pretax earnings.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).  This report includes information on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
This report contains certain non-GAAP measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include:
 
Pretax income (loss) margin and Pretax segment income (loss) margin;
Net income (loss) attributable to Ameriprise Financial margin;
Return on allocated equity;
Debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt;
Debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and 75% equity credit;
Pretax operating earnings;
Pretax operating earnings margin;
Total debt excluding non-recourse debt;
Total debt excluding non-recourse debt and 75% equity credit; and
Total capital excluding non-recourse debt.
 
Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures excluding these specific income statement impacts best reflects the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.  These non-GAAP measures are also used for goal setting, certain compensation related to the Company's annual incentive award program and evaluating the Company's performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts.
 
The Company presents debt to capital ratios excluding non-recourse debt of structured entities consolidated in accordance with FIN 46(R),  EITF 04-5 and other accounting literature and with a 75% equity credit for the Company's junior subordinated debt.  Management believes that the debt to capital ratios excluding this non-recourse debt better represent the Company's capital structure.

We also earn net investment income on owned assets from primarily certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-proprietary products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our proprietary products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.
