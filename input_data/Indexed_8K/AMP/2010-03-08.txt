Financial Measure Update
 
At February 28, 2010, cash and cash equivalents held at Ameriprise Financial, Inc., the parent holding company, were $1.4 billion.
 
Risk Factor Update
 
Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 sets forth information relating to the material risks and uncertainties that affect our business and common stock. In addition to those risk factors, we believe the following risk factor is also relevant to an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Changes in accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements.
 
From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other regulators change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and other financial data, even in instances where they may not have an economic impact on our business.
 
For example, FASB updated the accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities that requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated, effective January 1, 2010. We are in the process of evaluating whether any of the collateralized debt obligations we manage will be required to be so consolidated and the impact such consolidation would have on our balance sheet and results of operations. See "Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which portion is incorporated herein by reference. Further revisions to this standard may have an additional impact on us, which cannot be predicted at this time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
