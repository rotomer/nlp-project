Item 2.02      Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On April 26, 2010, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2010.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIE"), as well as certain integration charges and realized gains (losses). Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: operating net revenues; operating earnings; net realized gains (losses), after-tax; integration charges, after-tax; pretax income excluding CIE margin; net income excluding CIE margin; pretax segment income (loss) excluding integration charges; pretax segment income (loss) margin excluding integration charges; return on allocated equity; and return on allocated equity excluding integration charges. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures best reflects the underlying performance of our 2010 and 2009 operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. These non-GAAP measures are used to evaluate our performance on a basis comparable to that used by securities analysts and are considered by management in setting goals and in determining certain compensation related to our annual incentive award program.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income, the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs, property funds and hedge funds, and the recognition of an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006, which receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.  Management believes that the debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure.

News Release
 
 
 
 
See reconciliation tables included in this release.
 
MINNEAPOLIS  April 26, 2010 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial of $214 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $130 million for the first quarter of 2009. Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of 2010 was $0.81 compared to $0.58 a year ago.
 
The company has introduced new operating financial measures to provide continued transparency of the underlying performance of the business. Operating measures exclude the impact of a new accounting standard that required the company to consolidate client assets in certain investment entities on the Ameriprise Financial balance sheet and income statement; as well as integration expenses and net realized gains/losses.
 
Operating earnings increased 62 percent to $215 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $133 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share were $0.81 in the first quarter of 2010, up 35 percent from $0.60 a year ago. The increase in operating earnings was driven by higher asset-based revenues, higher income from spread products and re-engineering benefits.
 
Operating net revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2010, up 25 percent from a year ago, driven by growth in management fees from market appreciation on assets and net inflows in wrap accounts and asset management, as well as increased net investment income from higher fixed annuity account balances and higher investment yields.
 
As of March 31, 2010, the company's excess capital position was more than $2.5 billion, including approximately $1 billion for the company's pending acquisition of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business, which is expected to be completed on May 1, 2010. As of March 31, 2010, the company had $1.0 billion in net unrealized investment gains, reflecting the quality and diversity of its investment portfolio. Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and the equity impact of the required consolidation in certain investment entities, increased 5 percent from a year ago to $35.19.
 
Return on equity excluding AOCI was 9.3 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2010. Operating return on equity was 9.7 percent for the same period. Operating return on equity was negatively impacted by including the June 2009 share issuance in equity, the proceeds of which are being used for the Columbia Management acquisition while the related earnings will not be included in returns until the acquisition closes.
 
"We had a solid quarter aided by equity market appreciation and improved client activity," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "We generated positive retail client asset flows, driven by particular strength in our mutual fund wrap business, and we had good new client acquisition growth. These improvements led to a 31 percent increase in client assets and continued progress in the profitability of our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses.
 
"Despite lower absolute market levels and slower client activity compared with prior years, we generated our best first quarter earnings as a public company. The re-engineering and expense reductions we executed in 2009 have generated meaningful earnings leverage as conditions continue to improve. I am confident that our expense discipline, along with our strong balance sheet and capital, position us well for the current environment.
 
"We are on track to complete our acquisition of Columbia Management on May 1, 2010, and we're focused on executing a seamless integration. We believe the combined asset manager will possess an exceptional depth of investment talent and product capability, and we feel good about our ability to generate solid returns from that business.
"
 
First Quarter 2010 Business Highlights
 
     
The company had a strong quarter for new client acquisition, the highest level since second quarter 2008.
 
     
The introduction of the company's MORE WITHIN REACH
SM
 brand platform in the quarter increased Ameriprise Financial brand awareness.
 
     
Operating net revenue per financial advisor increased 25 percent compared to a year ago, primarily driven by the gradual improvement in client activity and market appreciation on assets.
 
     
Total advisors declined 5 percent year-over-year to 11,837, primarily due to the continuing departure of low-producing advisors. Franchise advisor retention rates remain strong. The company continued to recruit experienced advisors, although at a slower rate than in 2009.
 
     
Total owned, managed and administered assets were $463 billion at March 31, 2010, up 31 percent from a year ago, primarily due to market appreciation and strong wrap net inflows.
 
     
Total managed assets reached $332 billion, an increase of 31 percent from a year ago, driven by market appreciation and solid asset flows.
 
     
First quarter 2010 wrap net inflows were $2.5 billion, up 93 percent from a year ago. Net inflows and market appreciation increased total wrap assets to approximately $100 billion at March 31, 2010, an all-time high.
 
     
Total domestic asset management net outflows were $0.9 billion in the quarter as a result of $1.1 billion in retail net outflows. Hedge fund net inflows remained strong, and institutional net inflows of $0.1 billion included negative synergies of $0.6 billion in expected outflows from the Columbia Management acquisition, offset by new institutional mandates.
 
     
Total international asset management retail net inflows of $1.3 billion in the quarter were largely offset by $1.3 billion in institutional net outflows, driven by $1.5 billion in Zurich-related net outflows. Threadneedle continues to shift AUM toward higher fee asset classes.
 
     
Variable annuity ending balances increased 37 percent to $57 billion at quarter end driven by market appreciation on assets. Slower sales in the quarter resulted in net inflows of $98 million. Fixed annuity balances were $14.6 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago reflecting strong sales growth in the first two quarters of 2009. Fixed annuity net outflows of $166 million in the first quarter of 2010 were primarily due to the company's decision to lower crediting rates on new contracts, which lowered sales.
 
     
Variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) ending policyholder account balances were up 23 percent to $9 billion compared to a year ago. VUL/UL sales were $54 million in the quarter, up 64 percent from a year ago with increases in both variable and universal life insurance.
 
     
Ameriprise Auto & Home premiums increased 7 percent from a year ago, primarily due to growth in policy counts.
 
     
The company expects to complete the acquisition of Columbia Management's long-term asset management business on May 1, 2010. Operational and financial expectations are on track.
 
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2010
 
The company continued to maintain strong balance sheet fundamentals, excess capital and financial flexibility to capture additional growth opportunities.
 
Conservative capital management
 
                 
On April 26, 2010, the Ameriprise Financial Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend per common share to $0.18 per share, a $0.01 increase compared to the prior quarter's cash dividend. The dividend will be payable on May 21, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 7, 2010.
 
                 
The company's excess capital position was more than $2.5 billion, which included approximately
$1 billion for the Columbia Management acquisition.
 
                 
At the end of the first quarter of 2010, RiverSource Life's estimated risk-based capital ratio remained well in excess of 400 percent.
 
                 
The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk. The company's variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well.
 
Substantial liquidity
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were $4.8 billion, with $2.5 billion at the holding company level and $4.3 billion in free cash.
 
                 
Holding company cash increased sequentially, primarily as a result of the company's $750 million debt issuance during the quarter, as well as the $425 million dividend received from RiverSource Life.
 
                 
RiverSource Life increased cash by approximately $600 million in preparation to implement an enhanced variable annuity asset allocation program designed to help the company manage variable annuity subaccounts more efficiently and effectively. The implementation will require a portion of fixed account assets to move from the general account to separate accounts.
 
High-quality investment portfolio
 
                 
The $31 billion available-for-sale portfolio remained well diversified and high-quality.
 
                 
The investment portfolio remained in a net unrealized gain position, with $1.0 billion in net unrealized gains.
 
                 
During the quarter, the company recorded realized gains as it prepared to introduce an enhanced variable annuity asset allocation program. These gains were offset by realized losses as the company repositioned and strengthened its investment portfolio.
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $40.6 billion and remained well positioned. Detailed information about the portfolio is available online at ir.ameriprise.com.
 
Conservative capital ratios
 
                 
The debt-to-total capital ratio attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 20.5 percent. The debt-to-total capital ratio was 19.3 percent excluding non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidated investment entities and the 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities.
 
                 
The company issued $750 million of 10-year senior notes during the quarter. A portion of those proceeds will be used to retire $340 million of debt maturing in November 2010.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income including net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was 17.9 percent for the first quarter of 2010. The effective tax rate on net income excluding net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and the required consolidation in certain investment entities was 23.2 percent in the first quarter of 2010.
 
The company reduced its expected full-year operating tax rate from approximately 28 to 30 percent to approximately 25 to 27 percent based on expected benefits from tax planning. The company expects to record a large portion of these tax planning benefits in the first and second quarters of 2010.
 
Summary
 
 
 
 
During the first quarter of 2010, the company adopted a new accounting standard that required the consolidation of approximately $6 billion of client assets in certain investment entities on its balance sheet with the related income reported through its income statement. As noted previously, the company believes that operating results, which exclude the impact of the consolidation, as well as integration expenses and net realized gains/losses, improve transparency of the underlying performance of the business.
 
In addition, first quarter 2010 operating results included the following after-tax impacts:
 
                 
$18 million, or $0.07 per share, expense related to recognizing a substantial increase in Threadneedle's estimated market valuation attributable to its incentive compensation program compared to the 2009 market valuation. The charge reflects a valuation that increased more than 100 percent from the prior year and is higher than the year-end 2007 estimated valuation.
 
                 
$14 million, or $0.05 per share, benefit from payments related to the Reserve Funds matter.
 
                 
$3 million, or $0.01 per share, impact from the decline in net investment income from raising cash in the quarter in preparation for the introduction of an enhanced variable annuity asset allocation program.
 
 
 
Advice & Wealth Management
reported pretax income of $51 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to a pretax loss of $61 million a year ago. Segment operating earnings were $54 million compared to a $39 million loss a year ago. Pretax operating margin for the first quarter of 2010 was 6.1 percent.
 
Operating net revenues increased 20 percent, or $144 million, to $880 million. Wrap account assets increased to $100 billion, an all-time high driven by market appreciation and continued strong net inflows. While brokerage cash balances remain high, at $13 billion, cash spreads increased slightly to 53 basis points. These positives were partially offset by slow sales of annuities compared to a year ago.
 
Operating expenses increased 7 percent primarily as a result of higher distribution expenses. Segment operating general and administrative expenses declined 7 percent driven by expense controls partially offset by the introduction of a new advertising campaign and increased investment in the business, primarily the continued roll-out of an enhanced brokerage platform.
 
The company had a strong quarter for new client acquisition. Net retail inflows combined with market appreciation drove total retail client assets up 31 percent to $304 billion. The company continued to recruit experienced advisors, although at a slower rate than in 2009.
 
 
 
 
Asset Management
reported pretax income of $18 million for the quarter compared to an $8 million loss a year ago. Segment operating earnings were $22 million and included a $27 million negative impact related to recognizing the more than 100 percent year-over-year increase in Threadneedle's estimated market value attributable to its incentive compensation program. The company uses this annual valuation to mark-to-market all current and historical reserves for the program. Asset Management pretax operating margin for the first quarter of 2010 was 6.0 percent or 13.3 percent when excluding the Threadneedle valuation change.
 
Operating net revenues increased 40 percent, or $106 million, to $369 million, driven by higher management fees due to market appreciation on assets and net inflows in prior quarters. Excluding the impact of the Threadneedle valuation increase, segment operating general and administrative expenses increased 14 percent, primarily due to year-over-year timing differences in investment performance compensation accruals.
 
RiverSource Investments continued to improve equity investment performance and reported more than half of equity and fixed income assets above Lipper peer group medians for 1-, 3- and 5-year time periods, as of March 31, 2010. Threadneedle continues to maintain strong longer-term track records in both equity and fixed income portfolios.
 
Total managed assets were $246 billion, up 29 percent compared to a year ago. Domestic asset management experienced solid net inflows in hedge funds and positive institutional net inflows. Domestic institutional net inflows included $0.6 billion in outflows reflecting expected negative synergies from the Columbia Management acquisition, offset by solid growth in institutional mandates. Domestic asset management also experienced $1.1 billion in retail net outflows, which included the negative impact of lower year-over-year flows into variable products. Threadneedle continued to shift toward higher yielding asset classes.  International retail net inflows continued to be strong at $1.3 billion, while institutional net outflows of $1.3 billion were driven by Zurich-related net outflows.
 
 
 
Annuities
segment operating earnings increased 7 percent to $117 million compared to a year ago. Market volatility materially impacted DAC amortization expense, benefits expense and pretax operating earnings in the first quarter of 2009, making comparisons to the year-ago period less meaningful.
 
In the first quarter of 2010, the company took action related to the introduction of an enhanced variable annuity asset allocation program, increasing liquidity in general account assets in preparation to move those assets to separate accounts. This negatively impacted net investment income by $5 million. In addition, net investment income was negatively impacted in the quarter by lower commercial mortgage loan fees and the absence of consent fees and call premiums.
 
The mark-to-market impact of variable annuity living benefits increased benefits expense by $24 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily driven by model changes, FAS 157 valuation impacts and basis risk. The enhanced variable annuity asset allocation program the company will introduce in 2010 is designed to improve the mitigation of basis risk.
 
While variable annuity inflows were low at $98 million in the quarter, variable annuity exit rates improved over 150 basis points from the prior-year period. Fixed annuities net outflows of $166 million in the first quarter of 2010 were primarily due to lower sales from the company's decision to lower crediting rates on new contracts. Fixed annuity redemption rates also improved materially from the prior-year period.

Includes net realized gains.
 
Protection
reported pretax income of $119 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to pretax income of $112 million a year ago. Segment operating earnings were $118 million, up 13 percent compared to $104 million a year ago.
 
Operating revenues increased 4 percent, or $18 million, to $506 million, compared to a year ago, primarily driven by auto and home premium growth, as well as increased net investment income due to higher investment yields and increased general account assets.
 
Operating expenses increased slightly to $388 million from $384 million a year ago, as higher benefit expenses were partially offset by lower DAC amortization. The increase in benefits expenses was primarily driven by weather-related auto and home claims, offset by favorable life and disability income insurance claims. The decline in DAC amortization expenses was primarily the result of the unfavorable market impact a year ago.
 
VUL / UL account balances were up 23 percent year-over-year to $9 billion, primarily driven by equity market appreciation on VUL balances. VUL / UL sales of $54 million increased 64 percent from a year ago. Auto and home policy counts grew at a steady pace, up 9 percent from the prior-year period.

    Includes the revenues and expenses of the consolidated investment entities and net realized gains.

    Positive disclosed items increased operating earnings; negative of disclosed items decreased operating earnings.
 
Corporate & Other
reported pretax income of $53 million for the quarter of 2010 compared to a $38 million pretax loss in the prior-year period. Pretax income included $82 million attributable to noncontrolling interests and $1 million in realized gains compared to a $14 million loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the prior-year period. Segment pretax operating loss was $30 million in the first quarter compared to a pretax loss of $24 million in the prior-year period.
 
Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2009 included a $50 million benefit from repurchasing the company's hybrid securities at a discount. In the first quarter of 2010, operating earnings included a $20 million benefit from payments related to the Reserve Funds matter.
 
Operating interest and debt expense was down $2 million year-over-year. On March 11, 2010, the company issued $750 million in 10-year notes with a 5.3 percent coupon. In addition, the company swapped $1.375 billion of debt from fixed to floating, consistent with its asset-liability matching strategy.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") has revised the presentation in this statistical supplement to improve the transparency of its business results. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board updated the accounting standards related to the required consolidation of certain variable interest entities ("VIEs"). The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2010 and recorded a cumulative change in accounting principle resulting in an increase to appropriated retained earnings of consolidated investment entities of $473 million and consolidation of approximately $5.5 billion of client assets and $5.1 billion of liabilities in VIEs onto its balance sheet that were not previously consolidated. Management views the VIE assets as client assets and the liabilities have recourse only to those assets. While the economics of this business have not changed, both the Ameriprise Financial income statement and balance sheet were impacted.  Prior to adoption, the Company consolidated certain property funds and hedge funds (formerly Consolidated Managed Funds). These entities and the VIEs consolidated as of January 1, 2010, are defined as Consolidated Investment Entities ("CIEs").  The net income of the CIEs will be reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
 
Management believes it is important to present the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs to improve transparency into the underlying performance and economics of the Company's ongoing operations. The CIEs we manage have the following characteristics:
 
            
They were formed on behalf of institutional investors to obtain a diversified investment portfolio and were not formed in order to obtain financing for Ameriprise Financial.
            
Ameriprise Financial receives customary, industry standard management fees for the services it provides to these CIEs and has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize the investors' returns.
            
Ameriprise Financial does not have any obligation to provide financial support to the CIEs, does not provide any performance guarantees of the CIEs and has no obligation to absorb the investors' losses.
            
Management excludes the impact of consolidating the CIEs on assets, liabilities, pretax income and equity for setting the Company's financial performance targets and annual incentive award compensation targets.
 
The table below presents selected balances and metrics for the three months ended March 31, 2010 that identify the impacts from the consolidation of the CIEs.
 
 
Page 6 of the statistical supplement presents the consolidated GAAP income statements, equity and related metrics, page 7 presents the CIEs' impact to the income statements, equity and related metrics and page 8 presents the consolidated GAAP income statements and equity excluding CIEs and related metrics.

Return on equity is calculated using the trailing twelve months income in the numerator and shareholders' equity less accumulated other comprehensive income, calculated using a five point average of quarter-end equity in the denominator.
 
On a GAAP basis, the consolidated income statement reflects the impact of the required consolidation of certain VIEs.  This impact is recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, along with the income statement impacts of certain property funds and hedge funds.  Prior to adoption of the new accounting standard, the income statement impacts from the certain property funds and hedge funds were reflected in the Asset Management segment.  Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we reclassified this activity to the Corporate & Other segment for all periods presented.  The impacts from the new accounting standard together with the impacts from certain property funds and hedge funds are collectively referred to as the impact of the CIEs.
 
On a GAAP consolidated basis, management fees the Company earns for the services it provides to the CIEs and related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying bank loans, are reflected in net investment income.  In the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs and in the Asset Management segment, the Company continues to show the fees in the management and financial advice fees line and eliminates the impact of changes in the CIEs' assets and liabilities.
 
Management believes the exclusion of the impacts from consolidation of the CIEs, integration charges and realized gains/(losses) improves transparency into the underlying performance of the business.  Throughout this presentation, these measures are referred to as operating measures.

We also earn net investment income on owned assets from primarily certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-proprietary products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our proprietary products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.
