Item 5.03       Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
At the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders held on April 28, 2010, the stockholders of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation ("Certificate of Incorporation"), which will result in the declassification of the Company's Board of Directors ("Board").  The Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On April 29, 2010, a series of amendments to the Company's by-laws ("By-Laws"), approved by the Board in February 2010, became effective upon stockholder approval of the aforementioned amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation and the corresponding filing of a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. These amendments reflect recent changes in applicable law and update the By-Laws to conform to the amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation. A summary of the changes to the By-Laws is set forth below.
 
Amendments to Article I of the By-Laws, entitled "Stockholders", include: the clarification that meetings of stockholders may be held by "remote communication"; the additional authority granted to the Board, and other conforming changes, to bifurcate the record date for stockholders entitled to receive notice of and the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at a stockholder meeting; the additional authority granted to the Board to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of stockholder meetings; the addition of certain procedural powers granted to and obligations of the officer presiding over stockholder meetings; the addition of certain disclosure requirements for stockholders seeking to submit a nomination or proposal for an annual meeting; the clarification, and other conforming changes, that the advance notice requirement for a stockholder proposal related to business other than the nomination of a director shall be deemed satisfied where the stockholder has notified the Company of its intention to present the proposal in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and such proposal has been included in the Company's proxy statement; the addition of the requirement that a stockholder or stockholder representative appear at the meeting of stockholders to present the nomination or proposal made by such stockholder; and the clarification that a contested election will occur if the number of candidates for the election of directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected "as of the tenth (10
th
) day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting."
 
Amendments to Article II of the By-Laws, entitled "Board of Directors", include: the elimination of the statement that the discretion of the Board may be limited by the By-Laws; the elimination of the classified Board commencing in 2013, and other conforming changes; the clarification that meetings do not need to occur in a specific place; the clarification that, prior to the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders may only remove a director for cause and the addition of a new provision providing that, after the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders may remove a director with or without cause; and the deletion of the statement that the Board's ability to fill a vacancy on the Board is subject to the "Removal of Directors" section of the By-Laws.
 
Amendments to Article III of the By-Laws, entitled "Committees", include: the deletion of the requirement that a committee need be designated by a "resolution adopted by a majority of directors then in office"; the addition of the election of the Company to be governed by Section 141(c)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law; the deletion of the requirement that committee proceedings be reported to the Board at the Board meeting "next following such proceedings"; and the additional authority granted to committee members to resign via an electronic transmission.
 
The amendment to Article IV of the By-Laws, entitled "Officers", grants officers the additional authority to resign via an electronic transmission.
 
Amendments to Article V of the By-Laws, entitled "Capital Stock", include: clarifications as to the directors and officers authorized to sign stock certificates; and clarifications related to the aforementioned ability of the Board to bifurcate the record date for stockholder notice and voting rights.
 
The Company's amended and restated By-Laws are attached as Exhibit 3.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 3.2
Section 1.01.  .  The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as properly may come before such meeting shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, by remote communication and at such date and at such time, as may be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors and set forth in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting.
Annual Meetings
 
Section 1.02.  .  Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer (or, in the event of his or her absence or disability, by the President or any Executive Vice President), or by the Board of Directors.

Such special meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, or, within the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, by remote communication, as shall be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof. Any power of the stockholders of the Corporation to call a special meeting is specifically denied.
Special Meetings
 
Section 1.03.  .
Notice Of Meetings; Waiver
 
(a)
         
The Secretary of the Corporation or any Assistant Secretary shall cause written notice of the place, if any, date and hour of each meeting of the stockholders, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is called, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, to be given personally by mail or by electronic transmission, or as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given personally to a stockholder when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the record of stockholders of the Corporation, or, if a stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to such stockholder be mailed to some other address, then directed to such stockholder at such other address. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law.
 
(b)
        
A written waiver of any notice of any annual or special meeting signed by
 
the person entitled thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in a written waiver of notice. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
 
(c)
         
For notice given by electronic transmission to a stockholder to be effective, such stockholder must consent to the Corporation's giving notice by that particular form of electronic transmission. A stockholder may revoke consent to receive notice by electronic transmission by written notice to the Corporation. A stockholder's consent to notice by electronic transmission is automatically revoked if the Corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmission notices and such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, any Assistant Secretary, the transfer agent or other person responsible for giving notice.
 
(d)
        
Notices are deemed given (i) if by facsimile, when faxed to a number where the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when mailed electronically to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (iii) if by posting on an electronic network (such as a website or chatroom) together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (A) such posting or (B) the giving of the separate notice of such posting; or (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder in the manner consented to by the stockholder.
 
(e)
         
If a stockholder meeting is to be held via remote communications and stockholders will take action at such meeting, the notice of such meeting must: (i) specify the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present and vote at such meeting; and (ii) provide the information required to access the stockholder list. A waiver of notice may be given by electronic transmission.
 
Section 1.04.  .  Except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority in voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Quorum
 
Section 1.05.  .  If, pursuant to Section 5.05 of these By-Laws, a record
Voting
 
date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and a record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting have been fixed, every holder of record as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share outstanding in his or her name on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on such record date. If the Board of Directors fixes a record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and does not fix a record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.  If no record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the meeting has been fixed, then every holder of record of shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock standing in his or her name on the books of the Corporation at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice of the meeting is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, Directors shall be elected by the appropriate method provided for in Section 1.11 of these By-Laws, and in all other matters, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting and voting on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders.
 
Section 1.06.  .  No vote of the stockholders on an election of Directors need be taken by written ballot or by electronic transmission unless otherwise required by law. Any vote not required to be taken by ballot or by electronic transmission may be conducted in any manner approved by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting at which such vote is taken.
Voting By Ballot
 
Section 1.07.  .  If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the stockholders, the presiding officer of the meeting or the stockholders present in person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn any such meeting from time to time until a quorum is present. Notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if the place, if any, date and hour thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting, conforming to the requirements of Section 1.03 hereof, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.  If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.  At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting.
Adjournment
 
Section 1.08.  .  Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such meeting and express such vote on behalf of him or her by proxy. A stockholder may authorize a valid proxy by executing a written instrument signed by such stockholder, or by causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means including, but not limited to,
Proxies
 
by facsimile signature, or by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person designated as the holder of the proxy, a proxy solicitation firm or a like authorized agent. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after the expiration of three (3) years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing it, except in those cases where applicable law provides that a proxy shall be irrevocable. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation either an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date. Proxies by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of a writing or transmission created pursuant to this section may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
 
Section 1.09.  .  At every meeting of stockholders the presiding officer shall be the Chairman of the Board or, in the event of his or her absence or disability, a presiding officer chosen by the Board of Directors. The Secretary of the Corporation, or in the event of his or her absence or disability, an Assistant Secretary, if any, or if there be no Assistant Secretary, in the absence of the Secretary of the Corporation, an appointee of the presiding officer, shall act as Secretary of the meeting.

Successful Defense
 
Section 6.03.  .  Any indemnification of a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation under Section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation unless a determination is made that indemnification of the present or former Director or officer is not proper in the circumstances because he or she has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 hereof.  Any indemnification of a present or former employee or agent of the Corporation under Section 6.01 hereof (unless ordered by a court) may be made by the Corporation upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 hereof.

Such a "contract right" may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such Director, officer, employee or agent.
