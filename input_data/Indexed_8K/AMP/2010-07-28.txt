Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On July 28, 2010, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2010.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2010.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration charges and realized gains (losses). Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: Ameriprise Financial's shareholders' equity excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial's shareholders' equity excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial's shareholders' equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs; debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs and 75% equity credit; integration charges, after-tax; net realized gains (losses), after-tax; operating earnings; operating earnings per diluted share; operating margin; operating net revenues; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax income (loss) excluding CIEs; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs; total equity excluding CIEs; total long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt; total long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt and 75% equity credit. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2010 and 2009 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs, property funds and hedge funds, and the recognition of an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006, which receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.  Management believes that the debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure.

News Release
 
 
 
* Operating measures exclude net realized gains/losses, integration expenses and the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard in 2010 that required the company to consolidate $6 billion of client assets in certain investment entities on its balance sheet and report related revenues and expenses through its income statement. Reconciliation tables of GAAP to operating results are included throughout this release.
 
MINNEAPOLIS  July 28, 2010 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income
(1)
of $259 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $95 million for the second quarter of 2009.  Net income per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010 was $0.98 compared to $0.41 a year ago.
 
Operating earnings increased 172 percent to $291 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $107 million a year ago.  Operating earnings per diluted share were $1.10 in the second quarter of 2010, up 134 percent from $0.47 a year ago.  Operating earnings reflected organic growth driven by higher asset-based revenues and re-engineering benefits as well as two months of earnings from the Columbia Management acquisition that closed on April 30, 2010. Strong operating earnings growth reflected continued margin improvement in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management.
(1)
  Net income represents net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial.
Operating net revenues were $2.4 billion in the second quarter of 2010, up 27 percent from a year ago, driven primarily by growth in asset-based management fees and distribution fees resulting from higher asset levels and increased client activity.  Higher asset levels reflected market appreciation, the acquisition of Columbia Management and retail net inflows.  Excluding the acquisition, operating revenues grew 18 percent from a year ago.
 
As of June 30, 2010, the company's excess capital position was more than $1.5 billion after deploying $220 million to repurchase 5.7 million shares of common stock during the quarter.  The company's investment portfolio remained in a net unrealized gain position.  Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and the equity impact of the required consolidation in certain investment entities, book value per share increased 10 percent from a year ago to $36.07.
 
Return on shareholders' equity excluding AOCI was 10.6 percent for the 12 months ended June 30, 2010.  Operating return on equity was 11.4 percent for the same period.
 
"Our strong financial results for the quarter reflect the strength of our diversified business," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.  "Each of our segments performed well, led by stronger earnings in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management.  Client activity and advisor productivity continued to improve despite the on-going volatility in the markets."
 
"The Columbia Management integration is on schedule and on budget.  We are focused on delivering consistent, competitive performance, retaining and growing our retail and institutional assets, and achieving our expectations for revenue growth and expense synergies.
 
"We continue to operate from a position of financial strength, with a high-quality balance sheet and substantial excess capital.  During the quarter, we began to return more capital to our shareholders by buying back $220 million of common stock."
Summary
 
 
(1)
After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
The company believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses, integration charges and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment entities, best reflect the performance of the business.
 
Second quarter 2010 operating results demonstrated the strength of the business and included the following after-tax items:
 
      $25 million or $0.09 per diluted share expense from accelerated deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) amortization driven by the equity market declines in the quarter.
 
      $21 million or $0.08 per diluted share benefit from revising certain calculations in its valuation of DAC and DSIC.
 
      $16 million or $0.06 per diluted share benefit from the mark-to-market valuation of hedged living benefits, primarily driven by the impact of credit spreads on the GAAP liability valuation, which the company does not hedge.
 
      $5 million or $0.02 per diluted share expense from supporting the $1.00 net asset value of certain 2a-7 funds.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income excluding net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and the required consolidation of certain investment entities was 20.8 percent in the second quarter of 2010.  The company expects its full-year 2010 operating tax rate to be at the low end of the 25 to 27 percent range based on expected benefits from tax planning, a large portion of which have been realized in the first and second quarters of the year.
Second Quarter 2010 Business Highlights
 
                 
The company closed its acquisition of the long-term asset management business of Columbia Management on April 30, 2010.  The integration is progressing on schedule; operational and financial results are on track with expectations.
 
                 
Total owned, managed and administered assets were $600 billion at June 30, 2010, up 51 percent from a year ago, including $166 billion in acquired assets.  Excluding the acquisition, growth was driven by year-over-year market appreciation and retail net inflows.
 
                 
Total client assets increased 12 percent year-over-year reflecting market appreciation, retail net inflows and strong client and asset retention.
 
                 
Advisor productivity, measured as operating net revenue per advisor, increased 32 percent compared to a year ago, matching an all-time high.  Growth was primarily driven by higher asset-based fees as a result of year-over-year market appreciation and net inflows, improved client activity and the company's focus on higher-producing advisors.
 
                 
Total advisors declined 7 percent from a year ago to 11,684, primarily due to the departure of low-producing advisors.  Franchise advisor retention rates remain strong.  The company continued to recruit experienced advisors, although at a slower rate than in 2009.
 
                 
Asset Management segment managed assets increased 93 percent to $413 billion largely due to the acquisition of Columbia Management and the year-over-year appreciation in the S&P 500.  In the second quarter of 2010, U.S. asset management reported approximately $4.6 billion in net outflows, primarily in lower-margin portfolios.  In addition, Threadneedle reported approximately $1.1 billion in net outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by Zurich-related outflows.
 
                 
Wrap assets increased 23 percent year-over-year to $97 billion due to net inflows and market appreciation.  In the second quarter of 2010, wrap net inflows of $2.2 billion were more than offset by market depreciation on assets.
 
                 
Total annuity net inflows remained positive with $199 million in variable annuity net inflows in the quarter, partially offset by fixed annuity net outflows of $190 million.  While variable annuity net inflows remained below historical levels, net inflows more than doubled sequentially due to improved sales within the Ameriprise channel.
 
                 
The insurance business had its strongest cash sales quarter since the third quarter of 2008.  Variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) sales were $59 million in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year ago with increases in both variable and fixed universal life insurance.  In the second quarter of 2010, VUL/UL ending policyholder account balances were up 8 percent to $8.6 billion compared to a year ago.
 
                 
Ameriprise Auto & Home premiums increased 7 percent from a year ago, primarily due to growth in policy counts.
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2010
 
The company maintains strong balance sheet fundamentals, excess capital and financial flexibility to capture additional growth opportunities.
 
Conservative capital management
 
                 
The company's excess capital position was more than $1.5 billion.
 
                 
The company repurchased 5.7 million shares of its common stock for $220 million.
 
                 
RiverSource Life Insurance Company's estimated risk-based capital ratio was above 500 percent.
 
                 
The debt-to-total capital ratio attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 20.4 percent.  The debt-to-total capital ratio was 19.4 percent excluding non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidated investment entities and the 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities.
 
                 
The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk.  The company's variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well.
 
Substantial liquidity
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were $3.8 billion, with $1.6 billion at the holding company level and $2.1 billion in free cash.
 
High-quality investment portfolio
 
                 
The $32 billion available-for-sale portfolio remained well diversified and high quality.
 
                 
The investment portfolio remained in a net unrealized gain position, with $1.6 billion in net unrealized gains.
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $40.4 billion and remained well positioned.  Detailed information about the portfolio is available at ir.ameriprise.com
 
Segment Results
 
 
 
(1)
  Includes net realized gains (losses) and integration charges.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
reported pretax income of $85 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a pretax loss of $3 million a year ago.  Segment operating earnings were $88 million compared to $21 million a year ago.  Pretax operating margin for the second quarter of 2010 was 9.1 percent.
 
Operating net revenues increased 22 percent to $968 million from higher management and distribution fees driven by year-over-year market appreciation, retail net inflows and increased brokerage transactional activity.
 
Operating expenses increased 14 percent to $880 million, primarily as a result of higher advisor compensation from higher business levels.  Segment operating general and administrative expenses declined slightly reflecting cost controls partially offset by continued investment in the business, including the roll-out of an enhanced brokerage platform.
 
Advisor productivity increased for the fifth consecutive quarter driven by higher asset-based fees as a result of year-over-year market appreciation and net inflows, improved client activity and the company's focus on higher-producing advisors.
 
(1)
  Includes integration charges.
 
Asset Management
reported pretax income of $56 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to a $12 million loss a year ago.  Segment operating earnings were $104 million compared to a $3 million loss a year ago driven by the inclusion of two months of Columbia Management results during the quarter, as well as benefits from year-over-year market appreciation on assets and re-engineering.  Asset Management pretax operating margin for the second quarter of 2010 was 18.5 percent.
 
Operating net revenues increased 92 percent to $562 million driven by an increase in management fees due to the growth in assets from the acquisition and market appreciation.
 
Operating expenses increased 55 percent to $458 million, primarily reflecting increased general and administrative and distribution expenses from the acquisition.  During the quarter, the company recognized $48 million in integration-related expenses, which was consistent with original estimates.
 
The U.S. asset management business ended the quarter with $327 billion in managed assets and strong investment and wholesaling teams in place.  Investment performance continued to be solid, complementing strong longer-term investment track records.  Net outflows in the second quarter were $4.6 billion, including $2.1 billion from a single low-yielding institutional account and $0.8 billion in lower-margin sub-advised retail portfolios included in acquired assets, as well as integration-related outflows.  Retail net outflows also reflected slower equity sales, consistent with the industry.
 
At Threadneedle, total managed assets were $89 billion at June 30, 2010, up 8 percent from a year ago reflecting year-over-year market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by negative foreign currency translation.  Total net outflows of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2010 were primarily due to institutional outflows in Zurich-related portfolios.  In addition, market volatility negatively impacted European retail investor behavior in the quarter, dampening the positive trend in flows from prior quarters and contributing to net outflows in retail portfolios.  Longer-term investment track records remained strong.
 
 
(1)
  Includes net realized gains.
 
Annuities
reported pretax income of $133 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $94 million a year ago. Segment operating earnings were $129 million compared to $86 million a year ago.
Segment operating earnings in the quarter included the following items:
 
      $35 million increased expense from accelerated DAC and DSIC amortization driven by equity market declines in the quarter.
 
      $26 million benefit from revising certain calculations in its valuation of DAC and DSIC.
 
      $25 million benefit, net of DAC and DSIC, from the mark-to-market valuation of hedged living benefits, primarily driven by the impact of credit spreads on the GAAP liability valuation, which the company does not hedge.
 
      $6 million in additional benefits expense, net of DAC amortization, related to the implementation of an enhanced asset allocation program known as Enhanced Portfolio Navigator for variable annuity and variable universal life products.
 
Operating net revenues increased 13 percent to $626 million, reflecting increased management and distribution fees as a result of increased separate account balances, primarily due to higher equity market levels and variable annuity net inflows.
 
Segment general and administrative expenses increased $5 million from a year ago, primarily driven by additional expenses related to a new product introduction and the implementation of Enhanced Portfolio Navigator.
 
Total annuity net inflows in the quarter continued to reflect variable annuity net inflows largely offset by fixed annuity net outflows.  While variable annuity sales were consistent with the year-ago period, variable annuity sales increased 19 percent sequentially.  Lower fixed annuity sales in the quarter primarily reflected decreased client demand due to lower offered crediting rates.
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized gains (losses).
 
Protection
reported pretax income of $135 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to pretax income of $110 million a year ago.  Segment operating earnings were $134 million compared to $111 million a year ago. Operating earnings included a $7 million benefit from revising certain calculations in its valuation of DAC; a $6 million DAC amortization benefit from the introduction of Enhanced Portfolio Navigator; and a $4 million increase in expense from accelerated DAC amortization driven by equity market declines in the quarter.
 
Operating net revenues increased 4 percent to $520 million compared to a year ago, primarily driven by increased net investment income due to higher investment yields and increased general account assets, as well as auto and home premium growth.
 
Operating expenses were essentially flat at $386 million as volume-based expense increases were offset by a $6 million benefit from the introduction of Enhanced Portfolio Navigator.
 
Life and health insurance cash sales increased 23 percent from the year-ago period, reflecting improved client activity.
 
Auto and Home continued to grow new sales while retention remained strong driving net written premiums up 7 percent on a year-over-year basis.  In addition, the combined loss ratio and expense ratio in the quarter remained favorable.
 
 
(1)
    
Includes revenues and expenses of the consolidated investment entities, net realized gains and integration charges.
 
Corporate & Other

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") has revised the presentation in this statistical supplement to improve the transparency of its business results. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board updated the accounting standards related to the required consolidation of certain variable interest entities ("VIEs"). The Company adopted the accounting standard effective January 1, 2010 and recorded a cumulative change in accounting principle resulting in an increase to appropriated retained earnings of consolidated investment entities of $473 million and consolidation of approximately $5.5 billion of client assets and $5.1 billion of liabilities in VIEs onto its balance sheet that were not previously consolidated. Management views the VIE assets as client assets and the liabilities have recourse only to those assets. While the economics of this business have not changed, both the Ameriprise Financial income statement and balance sheet were impacted.  Prior to adoption, the Company consolidated certain property funds and hedge funds (formerly Consolidated Managed Funds). These entities and the VIEs consolidated as of January 1, 2010 are defined as Consolidated Investment Entities ("CIEs").  The net income of the CIEs will be reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
 
Management believes it is important to present the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs to improve transparency into the underlying performance and economics of the Company's ongoing operations. The CIEs have the following characteristics:
 
                 
They were formed on behalf of institutional investors to obtain a diversified investment portfolio and were not formed in order to obtain financing for Ameriprise Financial.
                 
Ameriprise Financial receives customary, industry standard management fees for the services it provides to these CIEs and has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize the investors' returns.
                 
Ameriprise Financial does not have any obligation to provide financial support to the CIEs, does not provide any performance guarantees of the CIEs and has no obligation to absorb the investors' losses.
                 
Management excludes the impact of consolidating the CIEs on assets, liabilities, pretax income and equity for setting the Company's financial performance targets and annual incentive award compensation targets.
 
The table below presents selected balances and metrics for the three months ended June 30, 2010 that identify the impacts from the consolidation of the CIEs.
 
 
Page 6 of the statistical supplement presents the consolidated GAAP income statements, equity and related metrics, page 7 presents the CIEs' impact to the income statements, equity and related metrics and page 8 presents the consolidated GAAP income statements and equity excluding CIEs and related metrics.

On a GAAP basis, the consolidated income statement reflects the impact of the required consolidation of certain VIEs.  This impact is recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, along with the income statement impacts of certain property funds and hedge funds.  Prior to adoption of the new accounting standard, the income statement impacts from the certain property funds and hedge funds were reflected in the Asset Management segment.  Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we reclassified this activity to the Corporate & Other segment for all periods presented.  The impacts from the new accounting standard together with the impacts from certain property funds and hedge funds are collectively referred to as the impact of the CIEs.
 
On a GAAP consolidated basis, management fees the Company earns for the services it provides to the CIEs and  related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying bank loans, are reflected in net investment income.  In the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs and in the Asset Management segment, the Company continues to show the fees in the management and financial advice fees line and eliminates the impact of changes in the CIEs' assets and liabilities.
 
Management believes the exclusion of the impacts from consolidation of the CIEs, integration charges and realized gains/(losses) improves transparency into the underlying performance of the business.  Throughout this presentation, these measures are referred to as operating measures.

Prior to adoption, the Company consolidated certain property funds and hedge funds (Consolidated Managed Funds). These entities and the VIEs are defined as Consolidated Investment Entities ("CIEs").
 
This report contains certain non-GAAP measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include:

Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.  Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and certain compensation-related matters.  See the reconciliations on pages 48 - 52.
 
Reclassification
 
Certain prior period information has been restated to conform to current period presentation.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Our affiliated financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both proprietary and non-proprietary products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets from primarily certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-proprietary products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our proprietary products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients.

Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of RiverSource Funds under the variable annuity contracts.

We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and property casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees, and charges that we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life separate account balances.
