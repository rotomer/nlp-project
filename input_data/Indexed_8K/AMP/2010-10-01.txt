Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 30, 2010, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Company") entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, HSBC Bank USA, National Association, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents (the "Credit Agreement"). Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Banc of America Securities, LLC, served as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners.  On that same date, the Company's previous credit facility expired.  The expired facility had been established pursuant to that certain credit agreement, dated as of September 30, 2005, among the Company, the lenders listed therein, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Citibank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Wachovia Bank, National Association and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal commitment amount at any time outstanding of up to $500 million.  The Company may increase the aggregate principal commitment amount to up to $750 million upon the satisfaction of certain approval requirements.  Extensions of credit under the facility may be applied by the Company for working capital or any other general corporate purposes and may be made in the form of revolving loans, swing line loans and bid loans, as well as letters of credit.  Subject to the terms set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the facility at any time prior to the termination of the facility.
 
Interest rates owed by the Company in connection with extensions of credit pursuant to the Credit Agreement are determined by reference to an identified market rate, plus an applicable margin that fluctuates based on the then current rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt.  The Company will also pay, on a quarterly basis, a facility fee on the aggregate amount of commitments by lenders under the facility, whether used or unused.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default.  The covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement include certain affirmative and negative operational and financial covenants, including without limitation restrictions on the Company's ability to incur liens, to make fundamental changes to its business and to enter into transactions with affiliates.  The financial covenants require the Company to maintain a consolidated net worth at all times equal to at least $6.891 billion and to not permit the Company's consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 40 percent.  In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for certain events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the acceleration of the Company's obligations under the facility and the termination of the lenders' obligation to extend credit pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
 
The lending commitments under the facility are scheduled to expire on September 29, 2011, at which time the Company will be required to pay in full all obligations then outstanding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to such expiration date, the Company may elect to convert its then outstanding principal amount of loans into a term loan which shall be due and payable on the one-year anniversary of the expiration date.
 
This description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement, a complete copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference in response to this Item 1.01.
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, certain parties to the Credit Agreement or the affiliates of such parties to provide commercial banking, investment banking, product distribution and other services for which the Company or its affiliates pay customary fees and commissions.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate as to the matters covered:
 
  On each Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon all parties) the Eurodollar Rate or One Month LIBOR Rate that shall apply to the Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each applicable Lender.

B.
Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate.
                                   
 
Administrative Agent determines that, or the Requisite Lenders determine
(i)
                                    
and advise Administrative Agent that, deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered in the London interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period; or
 
Administrative Agent otherwise determines, or the Requisite Lenders determine and advise Administrative Agent (which determination shall be binding and conclusive on all parties), that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Eurodollar Rate; or
(ii)
                                 
 
Administrative Agent determines, or the Requisite Lenders determine and advise Administrative Agent, that the Eurodollar Rate as determined by Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of maintaining or funding a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or that the making or funding of Eurodollar Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined by reference to the Eurodollar Rate has become impracticable as a result of an event occurring after the date of this Agreement which in the opinion of such Lenders materially affects such Loans;

An Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions; that no Agent shall be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law.

Agents Entitled to Act as Lender.

No Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to Lenders.
 
9.4
                              
Right to Indemnity

If any indemnity furnished to an Agent or any other such Person for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, such
provided
 
Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by Requisite Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  If Administrative Agent shall notify Lenders and Company that no Person has accepted such appointment as successor Administrative Agent, such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with Administrative Agent's notice and (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents, and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through Administrative Agent shall instead be made by, to or through each Lender directly, until such time as Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent in accordance with this subsection 9.5A.

(ii)
                                 
to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lenders or to authorize Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

any obligations of a Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit or any participation therein may be made separately from a sale, assignment, transfer or participation of a corresponding interest in the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Revolving Loans of the Lender effecting such sale, assignment, transfer or participation.  Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, except as provided in subsection 2.1A(ii) and subsection 10.5, the Swing Line Loan Commitment and the Swing Line Loans of Swing Line Lender may not be sold, assigned or transferred as described below to any Person other than a successor Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender to the extent contemplated by subsection 9.5.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Affiliates of each of Administrative Agent and Lenders and Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

provided
 
Upon such execution, delivery and consent, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement, (y) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (z) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment
 
Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.9B) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; provided that, anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is an Issuing Lender such Lender shall continue to have all rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender until the cancellation or expiration of any Letters of Credit issued by it and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder).  The assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its Notes, if any, to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall, if so requested by the assignee and/or the assigning Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1E, be issued to the assignee and/or to the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of or annexed hereto, as the case may be, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the amounts of the new Commitments and/or outstanding Revolving Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and/or the assigning Lender.  Other than as provided in subsection 2.1A(ii) and subsection 10.5, any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection 10.1B shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection 10.1C.

John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc.
 
The above-referenced case was filed in 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona and later transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged that they were investors in several of the Company's mutual funds and they purported to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 40 Act). The plaintiffs alleged that fees paid to the defendants by the funds for investment advisory and administrative services were excessive and sought unspecified damages, including disgorgement of the allegedly excessive fees paid plus interest and other costs. On July 6, 2007, the Court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment, dismissing all claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed the Court's decision, and on April 8, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's decision, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Company filed with the United States Supreme Court a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case in light of the Supreme Court's anticipated review, of a similar excessive fee case captioned Jones v. Harris Associates. On March 30, 2010, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Jones v. Harris Associates, and on April 5, 2010, the Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit's decision in this case and remanded it to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Jones v. Harris Associates. On June 4, 2010, the Eighth Circuit remanded the case to the district court for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Jones v. Harris Associates. The district court has received briefs and heard oral argument on the impact of the Jones v. Harris Associates decision.  The district court plans to issue a decision in early- to mid-November.
 
In re Medical Capital and Provident Shale
 
In July 2009, two issuers of private placement interests (Medical Capital Holdings, Inc./Medical Capital Corporation and affiliated corporations and Provident Shale Royalties, LLC and affiliated corporations) sold by the Company's subsidiary Securities America, Inc. ("SAI") were placed into receivership, which has resulted in the filing of several putative class action lawsuits and numerous arbitrations naming both SAI and Ameriprise Financial as well as related regulatory inquiries and actions. The putative class actions and arbitrations generally allege violations of state and/or federal securities laws in connection with SAI's sales of these private placement interests. These actions were commenced in September 2009 and thereafter, and seek unspecified damages. On January 26, 2010, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an Administrative Complaint against SAI, and on February 16, 2010, SAI filed an Answer. At this time, an Administrative Hearing in this matter has been scheduled to commence on September 30, 2010.On June 22, 2010, the Liquidating Trustee of the Provident Liquidating Trust filed an adversary action in the Provident bankruptcy proceeding naming SAI on behalf of both the Provident Liquidating Trust and a number of individual Provident investors who are
 
alleged to have assigned their claims. The action by the Liquidating Trustee generally alleges the same types of claims as are alleged in the class actions as well as a claim under the Bankruptcy Code.
 
These legal and regulatory proceedings and disputes are subject to uncertainties and, as such, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result.
