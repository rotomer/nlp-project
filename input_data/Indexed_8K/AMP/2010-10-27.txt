Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On October 27, 2010, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2010.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2010.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis.
 
Certain non-GAAP measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration charges and realized gains (losses). Our non-GAAP financial measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs; debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs and 75% equity credit; integration charges, after-tax; net realized gains (losses), after-tax; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating margin; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax earnings (loss) excluding CIEs; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs; total equity excluding CIEs; total long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt; and total long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt and 75% equity credit. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2010 and 2009 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
We also present in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs, property funds and hedge funds, and the recognition of an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006, which receive at least a 75% equity credit by the majority of the rating agencies.  Management believes that the debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure.

News Release
 
 
 
(Operating measures exclude net realized gains/losses, integration expenses and the impact of the adoption of a new accounting standard in 2010 that required the company to consolidate $6 billion of client assets in certain investment entities on its balance sheet and report related revenues and expenses through its income statement. Reconciliation tables of GAAP to operating results are included throughout this release.)
 
MINNEAPOLIS October 27, 2010 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported record net income
(1)
 of $344 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $260 million for the third quarter of 2009.  Net income per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.32 compared to $1.00 a year ago.
 
Operating earnings increased 31 percent to $355 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $272 million a year ago.  Operating earnings per diluted share were $1.37 in the third quarter of 2010, up 32 percent from $1.04 a year ago.  Operating earnings growth reflected higher equity markets, reengineering benefits and the first full quarter of Columbia Management earnings.
 
Operating net revenues were $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2010, up 26 percent from $1.9 billion a year ago, reflecting growth in asset-based fees driven by market appreciation, the acquisition of Columbia Management and retail net inflows.
 
(1)
 Net income represents net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial.
 
As of September 30, 2010, the company's excess capital position was more than $1.5 billion after deploying approximately $373 million in 2010 to repurchase more than 9.3 million shares of its common stock.  The company's investment portfolio ended the quarter with a $2.3 billion net unrealized gain.  Excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and the equity impact of the required consolidation in certain investment entities, book value per share increased 10 percent from a year ago, to $37.30.
 
Return on shareholders' equity excluding AOCI was 11.1 percent for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010.  Operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 12.0 percent for the same time period.
 
"We generated record third quarter earnings, driven largely by strong results in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.  "We're growing our core client base and our advisor force is strong and increasingly productive.  The integration of Columbia Management is proceeding well, and we are beginning to realize the benefits of the acquisition."
 
"While we continue to operate in a challenging environment, I am pleased with our positioning and the overall strength of our company."
Summary
 
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of 100% or greater

After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
The company believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses, integration charges and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment entities, best reflect the performance of the business.
 
Third quarter operating earnings results included the following after-tax items:
 
(1)
            
After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
Third quarter operating results in both periods benefited from the company's annual review and unlocking of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and model changes.  In the third quarter of 2010, this benefited earnings by $37 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to a benefit of $87 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
The $37 million after-tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010 reflected the following:
 
                 
$101 million benefit from persistency improvements, including a net benefit from extending annuity amortization periods and increased living benefits expense.
                 
$55 million expense from resetting near-term equity return assumptions equal to the long-term assumptions and reducing both near- and long-term bond fund return assumptions.
                 
$9 million in additional expenses from all other assumption and model changes.
 
The $15 million after-tax net variable annuity benefits expense was primarily driven by the impact of a 22 basis point narrowing of the credit default spread on the liability valuation.
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income excluding net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests and the required consolidation of certain investment entities was 27.6 percent in the third quarter of 2010.  While the company continues to expect its full-year 2010 operating tax rate to be at the low end of the 25 to 27 percent range based on benefits from tax planning, higher pretax earnings would result in a higher effective tax rate.
 
Third Quarter 2010 Business Highlights
 
                 
Total owned, managed and administered assets were $649 billion at September 30, 2010, up 48 percent from a year ago as a result of the acquisition of Columbia Management and market appreciation.
 
                 
Total client assets increased 9 percent year-over-year to $313 billion, reflecting market appreciation, retail net inflows in the advisor network, and strong client and advisor retention.
 
                 
Advisor productivity, measured as operating net revenue per advisor, increased 21 percent compared to a year ago.  Growth was primarily driven by higher asset-based fees as a result of year-over-year market appreciation and wrap net inflows, improved client activity and the company's focus on higher-producing advisors.
 
                 
Total advisors declined 6 percent from a year ago to 11,608, primarily due to the continued departure of low-producing advisors.  Advisor retention rates remained strong.
 
                 
Asset Management segment managed assets increased 89 percent to $445 billion largely due to the acquisition of Columbia Management and the year-over-year appreciation in the S&P 500, partially offset by net outflows.  In the third quarter of 2010, U.S. Asset Management reported $3.2 billion in net outflows, primarily in equity and subadvisory portfolios.  Threadneedle net inflows of $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2010 primarily reflected strong institutional net inflows, partially offset by Zurich-related net outflows and European retail net outflows.
 
                 
Wrap assets increased 18 percent year-over-year to $105 billion and included $1.8 billion in net inflows in the third quarter of 2010.
 
                 
Variable annuity net inflows more than doubled sequentially to $0.5 billion driven by the company's introduction of a new variable annuity in the Ameriprise channel, RAVA 5, and an updated guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider in the Ameriprise and third-party channels.  Third quarter 2010 variable annuity net inflows more than offset continued outflows in fixed annuities.
 
                 
Variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) sales decreased 2 percent from a year ago, with equity market increases driving a 6 percent year-over-year increase in VUL/UL ending policyholder account balances.
 
                 
Ameriprise Auto & Home premiums increased 7 percent from a year ago, primarily due to growth in policy counts.
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2010
 
The company maintains strong balance sheet fundamentals, excess capital and financial flexibility to capture additional growth opportunities.
 
Conservative capital management
 
                 
The company's excess capital position was more than $1.5 billion.
 
                 
The company repurchased 3.6 million shares of its common stock during the third quarter of 2010 for $153 million.
 
                 
RiverSource Life Insurance Company's estimated risk-based capital ratio remained above 500 percent.
 
                 
The debt-to-total capital ratio attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 20.0 percent.  The debt-to-total capital ratio was 19.0 percent, excluding non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidated investment entities and the 75 percent equity credit for the hybrid securities.
 
                 
The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk.  The company's variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well.
 
Substantial liquidity
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion, with $1.8 billion at the holding company level and $2.1 billion in free cash.
 
                 
The company will retire $340 million of debt on November 15, 2010.  The company's next outstanding debt maturity is in 2015.
 
High-quality investment portfolio
 
                 
The $33.6 billion available-for-sale portfolio remained well diversified and high quality.
 
                 
The investment portfolio remained in a net unrealized gain position, with $2.3 billion in net unrealized gains.
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $41.7 billion and remained well positioned.  Detailed information about the portfolio is available at ir.ameriprise.com.
Segment Results
 
 
(1)
            
Includes net realized gains and integration charges.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
reported pretax income of $87 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were $88 million compared to $28 million a year ago.  Third quarter 2010 pretax margin was 9.2 percent and operating pretax margin was 9.3 percent.
 
Operating net revenues increased 14 percent, or $119 million, to $946 million from higher management and distribution fees partially offset by lower net investment income.  Higher management and distribution fees were driven by year-over-year market appreciation, retail net inflows and increased brokerage transactional activity.  The decline in net investment income was driven by lower short-term interest rates and lower certificate balances.   The expected seasonal decline in third quarter distribution revenues was materially offset by increased sales of the company's new variable annuity product.
 
Operating expenses increased 7 percent, or $59 million, to $858 million, primarily as a result of higher advisor compensation from business growth.  General and administrative expenses excluding integration charges remained well controlled, contributing to margin expansion.  Operating general and administrative expenses declined $7 million from the prior year and $4 million sequentially.
 
Advisor productivity increased 21 percent from a year ago driven by higher asset-based fees as a result of year-over-year market appreciation and net inflows, improved client activity, and the company's focus on higher-producing advisors.
 
(1)
            
Includes net realized gains and integration charges.
 
Asset Management
reported pretax income of $104 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were $121 million compared to $17 million a year ago driven by the acquisition of Columbia Management, year-over-year market appreciation on assets, and re-engineering benefits.  Third quarter 2010 pretax margin was 15.7 percent and operating pretax margin was 18.3 percent.  The 4 percent sequential decline in the average S&P 500 negatively impacted operating pretax margins by approximately 1 percent.
 
Operating net revenues more than doubled compared to a year ago, increasing $333 million to $661 million, driven by an increase in management fees due to growth in assets from the acquisition and market appreciation.
Operating expenses increased 74 percent, or $229 million, to $540 million, primarily reflecting increased ongoing general and administrative and distribution expenses from the acquisition.  Year to date, the company has realized approximately $47 million in integration gross synergies and approximately $76 million in integration-related expenses, which were consistent with original estimates.
 
U.S. Asset Management assets under management were $347 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $146 billion a year ago, driven by the Columbia Management acquisition and market appreciation.  Investment performance continued to be solid, complementing strong longer-term investment track records.  Net outflows of $3.2 billion in the quarter were primarily in equity and subadvisory portfolios, reflecting industry-wide outflows in equities and lower retail sales as a result of pending fund mergers.
 
Threadneedle assets under management were $102 billion at September 30, 2010, up 9 percent from a year ago, reflecting year-over-year market appreciation and net inflows.  Net inflows of $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2010 primarily reflected strong institutional net inflows, partially offset by Zurich-related net outflows and European retail net outflows.  Overall, investment track records remained strong.
 
(1)
            
Includes net realized losses.
 
Annuities
reported pretax income of $264 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were $265 million for the third quarter of 2010, down $3 million from a year ago.  The items listed in the table above drove $26 million of the operating earnings decline, which was largely offset by business growth.
 
Operating net revenues increased 6 percent, or $36 million, to $627 million, reflecting increased management fees from higher separate account balances, increased premiums from life contingent payout annuities, and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees.  Third quarter 2010 net investment income declined primarily as a result of the implementation of Enhanced Portfolio Navigator in the second quarter of 2010, which resulted in a decline in general account assets and a commensurate increase in separate accounts.
 
Segment general and administrative expenses were down $2 million compared to a year ago.  These expenses declined $7 million sequentially as costs associated with the RAVA 5 introduction and the implementation of Enhanced Portfolio Navigator declined.
 
Variable annuity net inflows more than doubled sequentially from the introduction of RAVA 5 in the Ameriprise channel and an updated guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider in the advisor and outside distribution channels.  Variable annuity net inflows in the third quarter of 2010 were partially offset by continued fixed annuity net outflows reflecting low client demand.
 
(1)
            
Includes net realized gains.
 
Protection
reported pretax income of $65 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were also $65 million, down $73 million from a year ago.  The items listed in the table above drove a $63 million year-over-year decline in third quarter earnings.
 
Operating net revenues increased 13 percent, or $59 million, to $502 million.  The impact of unlocking in both periods resulted in $45 million in net revenue growth, with the remaining growth primarily driven by auto and home premiums.
 
Operating expenses increased 43 percent, or $132 million, to $437 million.  The impact of unlocking in both periods resulted in $117 million in increased expenses in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the prior-year period.  Benefits expenses also increased due to higher disability income and long-term care insurance claims in the third quarter of 2010.
 
Life and health insurance cash sales were flat with the year-ago period and down sequentially, reflecting historical third quarter seasonality.
 
Auto and Home continued to increase policy counts and retention remained strong, driving net written premiums up 7 percent compared to a year ago.  In addition, the combined loss ratio and expense ratio in the quarter remained favorable.
 
 
(1)
            
Includes revenues and expenses of the consolidated investment entities, net realized gains and integration charges.
 
Corporate & Other
reported a pretax loss of $78 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Segment operating loss was $48 million in the quarter compared to an operating pretax loss of $93 million a year ago.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). On a GAAP basis, the consolidated income statement reflects the impact of the required consolidation of certain consolidated investment entities ("CIEs"). The CIEs consist of certain property funds, hedge funds and the variable interest entities required to be consolidated under a new accounting standard that was adopted January 1, 2010. The net income of the CIEs is reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the CIEs is recorded in the Corporate & Other segment. Prior to adoption of the new accounting standard, the income statement impacts from certain property funds and hedge funds were reflected in the Asset Management segment. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we reclassified this activity to the Corporate & Other segment for all periods presented.  The impacts from the new accounting standard together with the impacts from certain property funds and hedge funds are collectively referred to as the impact of the CIEs.
 
On a GAAP consolidated basis, management fees the Company earns for the services it provides to the CIEs and related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying bank loans, are reflected in net investment income.  In the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs and in the Asset Management segment, the Company continues to show the fees in the management and financial advice fees line and eliminates the impact of changes in the CIEs' assets and liabilities.
 
Management believes it is important to present the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs to improve transparency into the underlying performance and economics of the Company's ongoing operations. The CIEs have the following characteristics:
 
They were formed on behalf of institutional investors to obtain a diversified investment portfolio and were not formed in order to obtain financing for Ameriprise Financial.
Ameriprise Financial receives customary, industry standard management fees for the services it provides to these CIEs and has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize the investors' returns.
Ameriprise Financial does not have any obligation to provide financial support to the CIEs, does not provide any performance guarantees of the CIEs and has no obligation to absorb the investors' losses.
Management excludes the impact of consolidating the CIEs on assets, liabilities, pretax income and equity for setting the Company's financial performance targets and annual incentive award compensation targets.
 
Page 5 of the statistical supplement presents the consolidated GAAP income statements, equity and related metrics, page 6 presents the CIEs' impact to the income statements, equity and related metrics and page 7 presents the consolidated GAAP income statements and equity excluding CIEs and related metrics.
 
Management believes the exclusion of the impacts from consolidation of the CIEs, integration charges and realized gains/(losses) improves transparency into the underlying performance of the business.  Throughout this presentation, these measures are referred to as operating measures.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).  This report includes information on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  Effective January 1, 2010, in accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard, the Company consolidated $5.8 billion of client assets and $6.1 billion of liabilities in variable interest entities ("VIEs").  Prior to adoption, the Company consolidated certain property funds and hedge funds (Consolidated Managed Funds). These entities and the VIEs are defined as Consolidated Investment Entities ("CIEs").
 
This report contains certain non-GAAP measures, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include:
 
Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding AOCI;
Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs;
Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs and AOCI;
Basic operating earnings per share;
Debt to total capital excluding non-recourse debt and equity of CIEs;

Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2010 and 2009 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and certain compensation-related matters.  See the reconciliations on pages 47 - 48.
 
Reclassification
 
Certain prior period information has been restated to conform to current period presentation.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Our affiliated financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both proprietary and non-proprietary products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets from primarily certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-proprietary products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our proprietary products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.
