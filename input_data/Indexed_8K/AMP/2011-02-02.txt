Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On February 2, 2011, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2010.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2010.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges and realized gains (losses). Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2010 and 2009 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), non-recourse debt, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs, and the recognition of an equity credit on our junior subordinated notes issued on May 26, 2006.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs and 75% equity credit for our junior subordinated notes; integration/restructuring charges net of tax; realized gains (losses) net of tax; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating expenses; operating margin; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax earnings (loss) excluding CIEs; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and 75% equity credit for our junior subordinated notes.

News Release
 
 
 
(Operating measures exclude net realized gains/losses, integration/restructuring expenses and the impact of the adoption of a 2010 accounting standard that required the company to consolidate approximately $6 billion of client assets in certain investment entities on its balance sheet and report related revenues and expenses through its income statement. Reconciliation tables of GAAP to operating results are included throughout this release.)

 Net income represents net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial.
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS February 2, 2010 Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported net income of $305 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $237 million for the fourth quarter of 2009.  Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1.18 compared to $0.90 a year ago.
 
Operating earnings increased 30 percent to $312 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $240 million a year ago.  Operating earnings per diluted share were $1.21 in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 33 percent from $0.91 a year ago.  Operating earnings growth was driven by strength in Asset Management and Advice & Wealth Management.
 
Operating net revenues were $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010, up 19 percent from $2.2 billion a year ago, due to growth in asset-based fees driven by the Columbia Management acquisition, market appreciation and retail client net inflows, as well as increased client activity levels.
 
As of December 31, 2010 the company's excess capital position remained more than $1.5 billion after deploying approximately $573 million in 2010 to repurchase approximately 13.1 million shares of its common stock.  The company's investment portfolio ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in net unrealized gains.
 
Return on shareholders' equity excluding AOCI was 11.5 percent for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010.  Operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 12.6 percent for the same time period, an increase of 340 basis points from a year ago.
 
For the full year, the company reported net income of $1.1 billion.  Operating earnings in 2010 were a record $1.2 billion, or $4.47 per diluted share, compared to $752 million in 2009, or $3.08 per diluted share.  Earnings growth was driven by improved client activity, market appreciation and retail client net inflows, as well as improved scale from the Columbia Management acquisition.
 
The company continued to generate a higher percentage of earnings from its less capital-demanding businesses. Excluding Corporate & Other segment results, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management accounted for 54 percent of fourth quarter 2010 pretax operating earnings compared to 30 percent in fourth quarter 2009.
 
"We delivered record earnings in 2010 and significantly increased operating return on equity, ending the year at 12.6 percent," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.  "This quarter marked a good finish to a great year, with strong earnings in our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management segments leading the way.  We continued to drive client asset growth and advisor productivity improvements, and we are realizing significant benefits from the Columbia Management acquisition."
 
"Despite the backdrop of ongoing economic challenges, 2010 was a year of significant growth for Ameriprise Financial; I am pleased with our position and the momentum we generated."
 
 
 
(1)
 After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
The following notable after-tax items are included in fourth quarter operating earnings:
 
                 
A $28 million expense, or $0.11 per diluted share, related to variable annuity guarantees driven by RiverSource Life's credit spread narrowing in the quarter and the impact of credit spread on a declining living benefit liability.  The company does not hedge the credit spread used for the accounting valuation and does not report the change in valuation as a realized gain or loss.
 
                 
A $7 million expense, or $0.03 per diluted share, from higher claims driven by a hail storm in the Phoenix area.
 
Additional variance items, including the impact of market appreciation on DAC and DSIC amortization (mean reversion), are included at the segment level.
 
Taxes
 
The effective tax rate on net income excluding net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests and the required consolidation of certain investment entities was 22.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The lower effective tax rate in the quarter reduced the full-year effective tax rate to 23.7 percent.
 
Fourth Quarter 2010 Business Highlights
 
                 
Total owned, managed and administered assets were $673 billion at December 31, 2010, up 47 percent from a year ago as a result of the acquisition of Columbia Management, market appreciation and retail client net inflows.
 
                 
Total retail client assets in Advice & Wealth Management increased 12 percent year-over-year to $329 billion, reflecting market appreciation and strong retail client net inflows.
 
                 
Advisor productivity, measured as operating net revenue per advisor, increased 21 percent compared to a year ago.  Growth was primarily driven by improved client activity, increased assets under management from market appreciation and retail client net inflows, as well as the company's focus on experienced advisors.  Total advisors declined 5 percent from a year ago reflecting the departure of lower producing advisors, partially offset by experienced advisor recruiting.
 
                 
Asset Management AUM increased 88 percent to $457 billion driven by the acquisition of Columbia Management and year-over-year equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.  Retail net outflows improved to $290 million in the quarter, primarily due to net inflows at Threadneedle.  Institutional net outflows of $5.7 billion included approximately $4.7 billion in lower basis point insurance portfolios.
 
                 
Equity investment performance at Columbia Management and Threadneedle remained strong across one-, three- and five-year periods.
 
                 
Wrap assets increased 19 percent year-over-year to $113 billion and included $2.0 billion in net inflows in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
                 
Variable annuity net inflows of $401 million were essentially flat compared to a year ago and more than offset continued fixed annuity net outflows.  During the quarter, the company discontinued new sales of RiverSource variable annuities in non-Ameriprise channels to further strengthen the risk and return characteristics of the business.  The fixed annuity business was not impacted by the decision.
 
                 
Variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) policyholder account balances increased 8 percent to $9.5 billion.
 
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010
 
Conservative capital management
 
                 
The company continued to maintain more than $1.5 billion in excess capital.
 
                 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $200 million. For the year, the company repurchased 13.1 million shares of its common stock for $573 million.
 
                 
In 2010, the company returned 67 percent of 2010 net income to shareholders.
 
                 
RiverSource Life Insurance Company's preliminary estimate of its risk-based capital ratio was 590 percent.
 
                 
The debt-to-total capital ratio attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 17.7 percent.  The debt-to-total capital ratio was 16.2 percent, excluding non-recourse debt, the impact of consolidated investment entities and the 75 percent equity credit for the junior subordinated notes.  The company's cash flow coverage ratio increased to 13X.
 
                 
The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk.  The company's variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well.
 
Substantial liquidity
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion, with $1.3 billion at the holding company level and $1.8 billion in free cash.
 
                 
The company retired $340 million of debt maturing during the quarter.  The company's next outstanding debt maturity is in 2015.
 
High-quality investment portfolio
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $39.9 billion at year end and remained well positioned for continued stress in the credit and commercial mortgage markets.  The portfolio has an average duration of approximately 3.7 years, and the company's asset liability management programs are positioned for a potential increase in interest rates.
 
                 
The company's available for sale portfolio ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in net unrealized gains.  The $0.8 billion sequential decline in unrealized gains was primarily driven by the increase in Treasury rates in the quarter.
 
Detailed information about the company's investment portfolio is available at ir.ameriprise.com.

(1)
  Includes net realized gains/losses and integration charges.

Fourth quarter 2010 pretax margin was 9.0 percent.  Pretax operating margin was 8.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 4.0 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 16 percent, or $140 million, to a record $1.0 billion.  Revenue growth was primarily due to higher management and distribution fees from increased client activity and higher assets under management.
 
Operating expenses increased 10 percent, or $85 million, to $925 million, primarily due to higher advisor compensation from business growth, partially offset by re-engineering benefits.
 
The company continued to increase the productivity of its advisors.  Net revenue per advisor increased 21 percent compared to a year ago due to increased client activity, higher assets under management from market appreciation and retail client net inflows, as well as the company's focus on experienced advisors.
 
 
Asset Management
reported pretax income of $140 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were $163 million compared to $77 million a year ago.  Fourth quarter 2010 pretax margin was 18.1 percent.  Pretax operating margin was 21.1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 16.6 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 66 percent, or $308 million, to $773 million, driven by an increase in management fees due to growth in assets from the Columbia acquisition, market appreciation and a continued shift to higher revenue yielding asset classes.  Fourth quarter 2010 operating net revenues included lower hedge fund revenues compared to a year ago.
 
Operating expenses increased 57 percent, or $222 million, to $610 million, primarily reflecting increased ongoing general and administrative and distribution expenses from the acquisition and performance-based compensation.
For the year, the company realized approximately $75 million in integration gross synergies and approximately $100 million in integration-related expenses, which were consistent with original estimates.
 
Segment AUM increased 88 percent from a year ago to $457 billion, primarily due to the Columbia acquisition and market appreciation.  Retail net outflows declined to $290 million in the quarter driven by inflows at Threadneedle.  Institutional net outflows at Columbia and Threadneedle were primarily in lower basis point insurance portfolios.  The following provides a summary of the U.S. Asset Management and Threadneedle businesses:
 
                 
Columbia Management AUM were $355 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $149 billion a year ago, driven by the Columbia acquisition and market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.  Retail net outflows improved sequentially to $1.5 billion in the quarter.  The majority of the $4.0 billion in institutional net outflows in the quarter were in lower basis point insurance portfolios.  Equity and fixed income investment performance remained strong across one-, three- and five-year periods.
 
                 
Threadneedle AUM were $106 billion at December 31, 2010, up 8 percent from a year ago, reflecting year-over-year market appreciation and retail net inflows, partially offset by negative foreign currency translation and institutional net outflows.  Institutional net outflows in the quarter primarily reflected continued outflows in Zurich-related portfolios.  Total net outflows of $633 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 reflected net outflows in lower basis point institutional portfolios, partially offset by $1.2 billion in retail net inflows from higher sales from European investors.  Investment track records remained strong across one-, three- and five-year periods.
 
 
Annuities
reported pretax income of $131 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were $128 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 down $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to an $18 million decrease in earnings from mean reversion and variable annuity guarantees.
 
Operating net revenues increased 6 percent, or $35 million, to $639 million, reflecting increased management fees from higher separate account balances and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decline in operating net investment income.
 
Operating expenses in the quarter included $43 million of net variable annuity living benefit expense, primarily due to the unhedged impact of reflecting RiverSource Life's credit spread in the accounting valuation of the liability.  In addition, expenses included a $23 million decrease in DAC and DSIC amortization driven by the market impact on separate account balances (mean reversion).
 
Variable annuity net inflows of $401 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 were partially offset by continued fixed annuity net outflows reflecting low client demand given current interest rates.  During the quarter, the company discontinued new sales of RiverSource variable annuities in non-Ameriprise channels to further strengthen the risk and return characteristics of the business.
 
 
Protection
reported pretax income of $85 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  Segment operating earnings were $86 million, down $30 million from a year ago driven by increased auto and home losses.
 
Operating net revenues increased 2 percent, or $11 million, to $526 million, primarily due to higher operating investment income driven by improvement in portfolio rate and asset growth, as well as auto and home premium growth, and higher management fees from VUL separate account growth.
 
Operating expenses increased 10 percent, or $41 million, to $440 million, primarily due to a $45 million increase in benefit expenses. These increases included $11 million in catastrophe losses from a hail storm in the Phoenix area and a $16 million reserve increase for higher auto liability claims.  Increased expenses in the life and health business were primarily driven by higher reserves for universal life products with secondary guarantees. The company increased ongoing reserve levels for this product beginning in the third quarter of 2010.  In addition, while disability income and long-term care claims in the quarter were higher than in fourth quarter 2009, fourth quarter 2010 claims declined sequentially and were in line with expectations.
 
Life insurance in force declined 1 percent from a year ago to $192 billion.  Auto & Home continued to grow its policy counts, up 9 percent compared to a year ago.  Retention remained strong.

On a GAAP basis, the consolidated income statement reflects the impact of the required consolidation of certain consolidated investment entities ("CIEs"). The CIEs consist of certain property funds, hedge funds and the variable interest entities required to be consolidated under a new accounting standard that was adopted January 1, 2010. The net income of the CIEs is reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The impact of the CIEs is recorded in the Corporate & Other segment. Prior to adoption of the new accounting standard, the income statement impacts from certain property funds and hedge funds were reflected in the Asset Management segment. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, we reclassified this activity to the Corporate & Other segment for all periods presented.  The impacts from the new accounting standard together with the impacts from certain property funds and hedge funds are collectively referred to as the impact of the CIEs.
 
On a GAAP consolidated basis, management fees the Company earns for the services it provides to the CIEs and related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily debt and underlying bank loans, are reflected in net investment income.  In the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs and in the Asset Management segment, the Company continues to show the fees in the management and financial advice fees line and eliminates the impact of changes in the CIEs' assets and liabilities.
 
Management believes it is important to present the consolidated income statements excluding the CIEs to improve transparency into the underlying performance and economics of the Company's ongoing operations. The CIEs have the following characteristics:
They were formed on behalf of institutional investors to obtain a diversified investment portfolio and were not formed in order to obtain financing for Ameriprise Financial.
Ameriprise Financial receives customary, industry standard management fees for the services it provides to these CIEs and has a fiduciary responsibility to maximize the investors' returns.
Ameriprise Financial does not have any obligation to provide financial support to the CIEs, does not provide any performance guarantees of the CIEs and has no obligation to absorb the investors' losses.
Management excludes the impact of consolidating the CIEs on assets, liabilities, pretax income and equity for setting the Company's financial performance targets and annual incentive award compensation targets.
 
Page 5 of the statistical supplement presents the consolidated GAAP income statements, equity and related metrics, page 6 presents the CIEs' impact to the income statements, equity and related metrics and page 7 presents the consolidated GAAP income statements and equity excluding CIEs and related metrics.
 
Management believes the exclusion of the impacts from consolidation of the CIEs, integration/restructuring charges and realized gains/(losses) improves transparency into the underlying performance of the business.  Throughout this presentation, these measures are referred to as operating measures.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2010, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class A fund shares for legacy RiverSource (including Seligman and Threadneedle) branded funds and on Class Z fund shares for legacy Columbia branded funds, as the majority of fund assets managed within the funds of each fund family are generally held in the designated share class. Prior to second quarter of 2010, the mutual fund performance rankings were based solely on the performance of the legacy RiverSource Class A fund shares.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds (RiverSource Class A and Columbia Class Z) with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (RiverSource Class A and Columbia Class Z)  divided by the total sum of RiverSource Class A assets and Columbia Class Z assets.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company) follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).  This report includes information on both a U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  Effective January 1, 2010, in accordance with the adoption of a new accounting standard, the Company consolidated $5.8 billion of client assets and $6.1 billion of liabilities in variable interest entities ("VIEs").

- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Our affiliated financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both proprietary and non-proprietary products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets from primarily certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-proprietary products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our proprietary products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on owned assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of RiverSource Funds under the variable annuity contracts.

We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and property casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees, and charges that we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life separate account balances.

In a discretionary wrap account, an unaffiliated investment advisor or our investment management subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC, chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client. In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts. These investors also pay any related fees or costs included in the underlying securities held in that account, such as underlying mutual fund operating expenses and Rule 12b-1 fees.
