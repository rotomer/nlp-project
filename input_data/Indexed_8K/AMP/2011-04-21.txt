Item 8.01       Other Events
 
On April 15, 2011, Securities America, Inc. (SAI), an independent broker-dealer subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the Company), and its holding company Securities America Financial Corporation entered into settlement agreements relating to SAI's sale of private placements issued by Medical Capital and Provident Royalties. Medical Capital and Provident Royalties are both in receivership.
 
In exchange for release of pending arbitration and litigation claims (including certain class action claims pending against the Company), the settlement agreements provide for the payment of a total of $150 million, $40 million of which was already reported and charged to the Company's fourth quarter 2010 results.
 
The combined settlements, together with other provisions for claims relating to Medical Capital or Provident Royalties, are expected to result in a $118 million pre-tax expense for the Company's first quarter 2011.
 
Management determined that a reasonable and expeditious solution to this unfortunate situation was in the best interest of all constituents.
 
SAI's participation in the settlements does not indicate any wrongdoing. Medical Capital and Provident Royalties are charged by the SEC for the frauds that led to SAI client losses. SAI was one of many companies that sold the securities.
 
Both settlement agreements are subject to certain conditions, including participation requirements for claimants to be covered by the settlements, and preliminary and final review and court approval of the class action settlement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, hereunto duly authorized.
