Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On April 25, 2011, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2011.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2011.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and Securities America legal expenses. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2011 and 2010 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), non-recourse debt, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings excluding Securities America legal expenses; operating return on equity excluding Securities America legal expenses and AOCI; operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating net investment income; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs.

News Release
 
(1)
    
Operating measures exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities, net realized gains or losses, and integration and restructuring charges, as well as the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits that the company added to the definition in the first quarter of 2011.  Reconciliation tables of GAAP to Operating results are included in this release.
 
MINNEAPOLIS  April 25, 2011  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported first quarter 2011 net income of $241 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to $214 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, a year ago.  During the first quarter of 2011, the company recognized a $77 million, or $0.30 per share, after-tax charge related to previously disclosed legal expenses at Securities America, Inc. (SAI), an independent broker-dealer subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial.  Excluding the legal expenses, first quarter 2011 operating earnings were $347 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, up 54 percent from $226 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, a year ago, driven by strength in Asset Management and Advice & Wealth Management.
 
 
Operating net revenues were $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2011, up 22 percent from $2.1 billion a year ago, due to growth in asset-based fees resulting from the Columbia Management acquisition, market appreciation and retail client net inflows.
 
Return on shareholders' equity excluding AOCI was 11.3 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011.  Excluding previously mentioned legal expenses, operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 13.6 percent for the same time period.
 
As of March 31, 2011, the company's excess capital position remained more than $1.5 billion after deployment of $395 million during the quarter to repurchase 6.5 million shares of its common stock.  The company has approximately $531 million remaining on its May 2010 share repurchase authorization.  In addition, the Ameriprise Financial Board of Directors increased the company's regular quarterly dividend 28 percent to $0.23 per share for shareholders of record as of May 6, 2011.
 
"We had a strong start to the year, with solid growth across our business," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.  "Advisor productivity is at record levels, and retail client assets, inflows and activity all improved.  This week marks the one-year anniversary of the Columbia Management acquisition; the integration remains on track and the business is performing well and gaining traction."
 
"We continue to benefit from our strong capital position.  During the quarter we repurchased 6.5 million shares of our stock for $395 million, and we increased our quarterly dividend by 5 cents per share."
 
On April 15, 2011, SAI and its holding company, Securities America Financial Corporation, ("Securities America" or "SA") entered into settlement agreements related to the sale of private placement securities issued by Medical Capital and Provident Royalties that resulted in a $118 million pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2011.  The charge is in addition to a $40 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2010.  SAI was one of many companies that sold the securities.  Management determined that a reasonable solution to this situation was in the best interest of all constituents.  SA's participation in the settlements does not indicate any wrongdoing.  Medical Capital and Provident Royalties are charged by the SEC for the frauds that led to SAI client losses.
 
In addition, management has decided to identify an appropriate buyer for SA.  A sale would allow SA to focus on growth opportunities in the independent channel and would allow Ameriprise to devote its resources to the Ameriprise branded-advisor business.  The sale process will not affect management's commitment to completion of the settlement on its current terms.
 
Starting in the first quarter of 2011, the company began reporting SA results as part of its Corporate & Other segment.  The company has revised the Advice & Wealth Management financial results and relevant business metrics to reflect the change.  Management believes it will meet all required criteria to present SA as discontinued operations beginning in the second quarter of 2011 and for prior periods.

The company believes the presentation of Operating earnings best represents the economics of the business. Operating earnings exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities, net realized gains or losses, and integration and restructuring charges, as well as the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits that the company added to the definition in the first quarter of 2011.  This press release and the First Quarter 2011 Statistical Supplement on ir.ameriprise.com reflect the enhanced definition.
 
(1)
  After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
First quarter 2011 operating earnings included the following after-tax impacts:
 
                 
A $77 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, expense from resolving a legal matter at SA.
 
                 
A $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, net impact at Threadneedle from an industry-wide Financial Services Authority regulatory levy.
 
                 
A $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, expense related to recognizing an increase in Threadneedle's estimated market valuation for purposes of its incentive compensation program.
 
The first quarter of 2011 also included two fewer business days for the earning of management and distribution fees than the sequential quarter that impacted results by approximately $10 million, or $0.04 per share, and the issuance of 3.1 million shares of Ameriprise common stock as part of the company's annual review and award practices under employee and advisor compensation programs.
 
Taxes
 
The reported effective tax rate on net income attributable to Ameriprise Financial, which includes the previously discussed legal settlement, was 16.7 percent for the first quarter of 2011.  Excluding the impact of the legal settlement, the operating effective tax rate on net income attributable to Ameriprise was 23.2 percent for the first quarter of 2011, and the company expects its full-year 2011 operating effective tax rate to be 26 to 28 percent.
 
First Quarter 2011 Business Highlights
 
                 
Total assets under management and administration were $693 billion at March 31, 2011, up 50 percent from a year ago as a result of the acquisition of Columbia Management, market appreciation and retail client net inflows.
 
                 
Total branded retail client assets in Advice & Wealth Management increased 13 percent year-over-year to $315 billion, reflecting market appreciation and strong retail client net inflows.
 
                 
Ameriprise advisor productivity, measured as operating net revenue per advisor, was $95,000 in the quarter, a 23 percent increase compared to a year ago.  Growth was primarily driven by improved client activity and increased assets under management from market appreciation and retail client net inflows.  The branded advisor force remained stable: the number of advisors declined 3 percent from a year ago and was essentially flat on a sequential basis, reflecting the departure of lower-producing advisors, offset by experienced advisor recruiting and strong advisor retention.
 
                 
Total branded client wrap assets grew 20 percent from a year ago to $103 billion, including $2.8 billion in net inflows in the quarter.
 
                 
Asset Management AUM increased 89 percent to $465 billion driven by the acquisition of Columbia Management and year-over-year equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.  Columbia Management net outflows improved significantly to $2.0 billion in the quarter driven by retail fund sales growth and lower institutional net outflows.  At Threadneedle, $3.0 billion in net outflows in the quarter were driven by institutional outflows, mainly in lower-margin Zurich portfolios, and higher redemptions from European retail investors reflecting market volatility.
 
                 
Equity and fixed income investment performance at Columbia Management and Threadneedle continues to be strong.
 
                 
Columbia Management further enhanced its retail product line-up, completing the initial phase of fund mergers.  The company expects to complete the vast majority of remaining fund mergers in the second quarter of 2011.  In addition, in April 2011, Columbia Management launched The Columbia Absolute Return Multi-Strategy Fund and the Columbia Absolute Return Enhanced Multi-Strategy Fund and announced an agreement to acquire Grail Advisors LLC, a registered investment adviser that offers actively managed exchange traded funds.
 
                 
Variable annuity ending balances increased 14 percent to $65 billion from market appreciation and net inflows of $104 million in the quarter.  First quarter 2011 variable annuity net inflows included strong sales in the Ameriprise channel.  The company discontinued sales of variable annuities through non-Ameriprise channels in the fourth quarter of 2010 to further strengthen the risk return characteristics of the business, and the resulting outflows were in line with expectations.
 
                 
Variable universal life / universal life policyholder account balances increased 8 percent to $9.7 billion.
 
                 
Ameriprise Bank, FSB introduced the Home Ownership Accelerator in the advisor channel during the quarter.  The innovative loan program is designed to reduce interest costs and pay down mortgages faster than traditional mortgages.
 
Liquidity and Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2011
 
Conservative capital management
 
                 
The company continued to maintain more than $1.5 billion in excess capital.
 
                 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 6.5 million shares of its common stock for $395 million.  The company has $531 million remaining from its $1.5 billion authorization announced in May 2010.
 
                 
The Ameriprise Financial Board of Directors raised the regular quarterly dividend 28 percent to $0.23 per share payable on May 20, 2011 to shareholders of record as of May 6, 2011.
 
                 
RiverSource Life Insurance Company's estimated risk-based capital ratio was above 585 percent.
 
                 
The debt-to-total capital ratio attributable to Ameriprise Financial was 17.9 percent.  The debt-to-total capital ratio was 18.3 percent excluding non-recourse debt and the impact of consolidated investment entities.
 
                 
The company will continue to use enterprise risk management capabilities and product hedging to anticipate and mitigate risk.  The company's variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well.
 
Substantial liquidity
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion, with $0.9 billion at the holding company level and $1.5 billion in free cash.
 
High-quality investment portfolio
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $39.9 billion at March 31, 2011 and remained well positioned for continued stress in the credit and commercial mortgage markets.  The company's asset liability management programs remained well positioned for a potential increase in interest rates.
 
                 
The company's available for sale portfolio ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in net unrealized gains.

First Quarter 2011 Segment Results
 
(1)
  Includes net realized gains/losses and integration/restructuring charges.
 
(Note:  Advice & Wealth Management results and metrics have been revised to reflect SA moving to the Corporate & Other segment.)
 
Advice & Wealth Management
reported pretax income of $100 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Segment operating earnings were $99 million compared to $51 million a year ago.
 
First quarter 2011 pretax operating margin was 10.8 percent compared to 6.7 percent a year ago.  First quarter 2011 segment results reflected the ongoing impact of the low short-term interest rate environment as well as two fewer business days compared to the sequential quarter, which reduced operating earnings by approximately $6 million.
 
Operating net revenues increased 19 percent, or $147 million, to $913 million.  Revenue growth was primarily due to higher management and distribution fees from increased client activity and higher assets under management.
 
Operating expenses increased 14 percent, or $99 million, to $814 million, primarily due to higher advisor compensation from business growth, partially offset by re-engineering benefits.
 
Retail client assets grew 13 percent to $315 billion, including strong net inflows in wrap accounts and market appreciation, as well as growth from client acquisition and experienced advisor recruiting.
 
The company continued to increase the productivity of its branded advisors.  Net revenue per advisor was $95,000 in the quarter, a 23 percent increase compared to a year ago, primarily driven by increased client activity and higher assets under management from market appreciation and retail client net inflows.  The number of branded advisors declined 3 percent from a year ago and was essentially flat on a sequential basis, reflecting the departure of lower-producing advisors, offset by experienced advisor recruiting and strong advisor retention.
 
 
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of 100% or greater
(1)
   Includes net realized gains and integration/restructuring charges.
 
Asset Management
reported pretax income of $107 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Segment operating earnings were $136 million compared to $22 million a year ago. On a sequential basis, first quarter 2011 segment results included two fewer business days than the fourth quarter of 2010, which reduced earnings by approximately $10 million.  The first quarter of 2011 also included the following Threadneedle related expenses: a $5 million pretax net impact from an industry-wide FSA regulatory levy and a $5 million pretax expense related to recognizing an increase in Threadneedle's estimated market valuation for purposes of its incentive compensation program.
 
First quarter 2011 adjusted net pretax operating margin, which excludes pass-through distribution expenses, was 33.6 percent for the quarter compared to 11.3 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues essentially doubled, increasing by $368 million, to $737 million, driven by an increase in management fees due to growth in assets from the Columbia acquisition, market appreciation and a continued shift to higher revenue-yielding asset classes.
 
Operating expenses increased 73 percent, or $254 million, to $601 million, primarily reflecting increased ongoing general and administrative and distribution expenses from the acquisition as well as investments at Columbia Management and Threadneedle. Since closing the Columbia Management acquisition in 2010, the company has realized approximately $106 million of total gross expense synergies.  The company incurred $29 million of integration-related expenses during the first quarter of 2011.
 
Segment AUM increased 89 percent from a year ago to $465 billion, driven by the Columbia Management acquisition and market appreciation.
 
Columbia Management AUM was $363 billion at March 31, 2011 compared to $153 billion a year ago, primarily due to the acquisition and market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.  Investment performance continues to be strong.  First quarter 2011 retail net outflows were $538 million, reflecting strong equity sales and continued outflows in tax-exempt portfolios.  Institutional net outflows improved to $1.0 billion in the quarter from $4.0 billion in the sequential quarter.
 
Threadneedle AUM was $107 billion at March 31, 2011, up 10 percent from a year ago primarily due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.  Investment performance continues to be strong.  During the quarter, retail net outflows of $585 million were driven by higher redemptions from European investors reflecting market volatility.  Retail sales remained stable.  Institutional net outflows were $2.4 billion in the quarter, with the majority in lower-margin Zurich portfolios.
 
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized gains/losses and market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of DAC and DSIC.
 
Annuities
reported pretax income of $154 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Segment operating earnings were $174 million for the first quarter of 2011, up $40 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher fee revenue from growth in variable annuity separate account balances.
 
Operating net revenues increased 7 percent, or $44 million, to $643 million, reflecting increased management fees from higher separate account balances and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decline in operating net investment income.
 
Operating expenses increased 1 percent, or $4 million, to $469 million in the quarter.  Higher distribution expenses from increased variable annuity sales were more than offset by lower interest credited to client accounts.  In addition, the first quarter of 2011 included a $16 million decrease in DAC and DSIC amortization expenses driven by the market impact on separate account balances (mean reversion) compared to a $7 million decrease a year ago.
 
Variable annuity net inflows in the quarter increased 6 percent to $104 million driven by strong sales in the Ameriprise channel.  The company discontinued new sales of variable annuities through non-Ameriprise channels in the fourth quarter of 2010 to further strengthen the risk-return characteristics of the business, and the resulting outflows were in line with expectations.  Fixed annuities continued to be in net outflows due to low client demand given current interest rates.
 
 
 
(1)
  Includes net realized gains.
 
Protection
reported pretax income of $107 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Segment operating earnings were $106 million, down $12 million from a year ago driven by increased benefits expenses.
 
Operating net revenues increased 2 percent, or $12 million, to $518 million, primarily due to Auto & Home premium growth and higher operating investment income driven by growth in assets.
 
Operating expenses increased 6 percent, or $24 million, to $412 million, reflecting $5 million in higher ongoing reserve levels for universal life products with secondary guarantees.  In addition, first quarter 2011 expenses included $8 million in higher auto liability reserves.  However, during the first quarter of 2011, the company
experienced improvement in reported Auto & Home losses and loss frequency compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and will continue to monitor these potential signs of improvement.
 
Life insurance in force remained flat to a year ago at $192 billion.  Auto & Home continued to grow its policy counts, up 9 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
NM
  
Not Meaningful  variance of 100% or greater

  Includes revenues and expenses of the consolidated investment entities and net realized gains.

reported a pretax loss of $197 million for the first quarter of 2011.  The segment operating loss was $181 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $27 million a year ago, an increase of $154 million primarily attributable to SA legal expenses.  The first quarter of 2010 included a $20 million benefit related to the Reserve Funds matter.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures best reflect the underlying performance of the Company and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.  Accordingly, this Statistical Supplement Package presents the Company's operating results and related operating metrics.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Reconciliation of GAAP Metrics to Operating Metrics" beginning on page 44.
 
Effective for first quarter 2011, management made certain changes in its Statistical Supplement Package:
*Amended its definition of operating earnings as it relates to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits
*Removed the Owned, Managed and Administered Assets disclosures and replaced them with Assets under Management and Assets under Administration disclosures
*Provided more details into net flows for the Columbia managed retail funds
*Transferred the results of operations attributable to Securities America from the Advice & Wealth Management segment to the Corporate & Other segment
 
Management views the operating measures under the amended definition as a more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of its segments, as the amended definition presents results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses.  Under the amended definition, operating measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), net realized gains or losses, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and integration and restructuring charges.  Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.  Management has recast the prior period amounts to conform to the way management currently manages and monitors segment performance during the current period, including moving the results of operations attributable to Securities America from the Advice & Wealth Management segment to the Corporate & Other segment.
 
In addition to amending the definition of operating earnings, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.  In the Asset Management segment, operating revenues are adjusted to exclude distribution pass through revenues and subadvisory and other pass through revenues, and operating earnings are adjusted to exclude operating net investment income and amortization of intangibles.
 
Prior to the amendment of the definition of operating earnings, operating earnings included the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  Beginning with results reported in first quarter 2011, operating earnings are adjusted to exclude this impact (prior quarters have been restated).  The market impact includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated hedge asset values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.  The Company views operating earnings under the amended definition as a more meaningful presentation of its results.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
The Company removed its Owned, Managed and Administered Assets disclosure and replaced it with Assets Under Management and Administration disclosures.  This presentation better aligns the assets with the fees that are generated and is more consistent with peers.
 
Management provided more detail into the components of the Columbia Managed Assets Rollforward for retail funds by breaking out mutual fund inflows, mutual fund outflows, reinvested dividends and distributions separately.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2010, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class A fund shares for legacy RiverSource (including Seligman and Threadneedle) branded funds and on Class Z fund shares for legacy Columbia branded funds, as the majority of fund assets managed within the funds of each fund family are generally held in the designated share class. Prior to second quarter of 2010, the mutual fund performance rankings were based solely on the performance of the legacy RiverSource Class A fund shares.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds (RiverSource Class A and Columbia Class Z) with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (RiverSource Class A and Columbia Class Z)  divided by the total sum of RiverSource Class A assets and Columbia Class Z assets.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data shows actively-managed mutual funds by affiliated investment managers as well as certain index funds.  Effective first quarter of 2011, we have clarified the definition of the included funds. Percentages did not change.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. Effective with results reported in first quarter 2011, results of operations attributable to Securities America have been transferred to the Corporate & Other segment.  All prior periods have been restated.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients. Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC, formerly known as RiverSource Investments, LLC, predominantly provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Srl (Threadneedle) predominantly provides international investment products and services. U.S. domestic retail products are distributed through our Advice & Wealth Management segment and also through unaffiliated third party financial institutions, including distribution through Bank of America and its affiliates. Institutional products and services are primarily sold through our institutional sales force. International retail products are primarily distributed through third parties. Retail products include mutual funds, variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts, separately managed accounts and collective funds. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separate accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds and property funds. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. In addition to the products and services provided to third party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services. The fees for all such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.
 
Annuities -
This segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to retail clients. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2010, our variable annuity products were distributed through affiliated financial advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we discontinued new sales of our variable annuities in non-Ameriprise channels to further strengthen the risk and return characteristics of the business.  Our fixed annuity products are distributed through affiliated advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of RiverSource Variable Series Trust, Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust, Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust I and Wanger Advisors Trust funds under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Protection -

Life and disability income products are primarily distributed through Ameriprise advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold direct, primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and property casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees, and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on invested assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by the Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of RiverSource Variable Series Trust, Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust, Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust I and Wanger Advisors Trust funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Corporate & Other -
This segment consists of net investment income on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues from various investments as well as unallocated corporate expenses.

Consolidated Investment Entities ("CIEs") -
CIEs include certain property and hedge funds as well as the variable interest entities required to be consolidated under current accounting standards.
 
DAC Rollforward Other -

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Amortization
- Deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") represent the costs of acquiring new protection, annuity and certain mutual fund business, principally direct sales commissions and other distribution and underwriting costs that have been deferred on the sale of annuity, life, disability income and long term care insurance and, to a lesser extent, deferred marketing and promotion expenses on auto and home insurance and deferred distribution costs on certain mutual fund products. These costs are deferred to the extent they are recoverable from future profits.

Wrap Accounts
- Wrap accounts enable our clients to purchase other securities such as mutual funds in connection with investment advisory fee-based "wrap account" programs or services. We offer clients the opportunity to select products that include affiliated and non-affiliated funds. We currently offer both discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory wrap accounts. In a discretionary wrap account, an unaffiliated investment advisor or our investment management subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC, chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client. In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts. These investors also pay any related fees or costs included in the underlying securities held in that account, such as underlying mutual fund operating expenses and Rule 12b-1 fees.
