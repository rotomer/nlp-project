Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On July 27, 2011, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2011.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2011.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2011 and 2010 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), non-recourse debt, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding CIEs; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating net investment income; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  July 27, 2011  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported second quarter 2011 operating earnings of $328 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, up 21 percent from $272 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to a year ago. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial was $313 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, compared to $257 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues were $2.6 billion, up 14 percent from $2.3 billion a year ago driven by growth in asset-based fees from retail client net inflows, market appreciation and the Columbia Management acquisition.
 
Operating earnings growth reflected higher revenues from business growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate.
 
Operating return on shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) increased to 14.5 percent for the 12 months ended June 30, 2011, compared to 11.5 percent for the 12 months ended June 30, 2010.
 
The company's excess capital position remains strong. During the quarter, the company deployed $366 million to repurchase 6.1 million shares of its common stock and announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization due to the accelerated pace of repurchases under the program announced in May 2010.
 
"Ameriprise Financial continued to generate strong revenue growth as well as higher earnings and returns in the second quarter," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "In fact, our operating return on equity reached an all-time high of 14.5 percent."
 
"Our advisory and asset management businesses are generating strong results. Advisor productivity reached another record high, and we're driving good asset flows and client activity. Our asset management results in the quarter demonstrate the benefits of our increased scale and geographic reach, with strong earnings growth and improved retail and institutional flows."

Operating measures exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities, net realized gains or losses, integration and restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and discontinued operations. Reconciliation tables of GAAP to Operating results are included in this release.
 
Second Quarter 2011 Business Highlights
 
                 
Total assets under management and administration were $670 billion at June 30, 2011, up 17 percent from a year ago as a result of net inflows and market appreciation. Total assets under management and administration exclude assets from discontinued operations.
 
                 
Asset Management assets under management (AUM) increased 13 percent to $467 billion driven by year-over-year equity market appreciation.
 
                 
Retail client assets in Advice & Wealth Management increased 20 percent year-over-year to $319 billion, reflecting market appreciation and strong retail client net inflows.
 
                 
Branded wrap assets grew 27 percent from a year ago to $106 billion due to market appreciation and net inflows, including net inflows of $2.3 billion in the quarter.
 
                 
Ameriprise advisor productivity, measured as operating net revenue per advisor, was $99,000 in the quarter, a 14 percent increase compared to a year ago. Growth was primarily driven by improved client activity and retail client net inflows.
 
                
On a sequential basis, the number of financial advisors increased slightly, reflecting continued experienced advisor recruiting and strong advisor retention, partially offset by the departure of lower-producing advisors.
 
                 
Asset Management net inflows of $0.5 billion in the quarter compared to net outflows of $4.9 billion a year ago and net outflows of $4.8 billion in the prior quarter. Net flows improved significantly, reflecting improved sales and lower redemptions in European retail and institutional portfolios.
 
                 
Investment performance remained strong at both Columbia Management and Threadneedle.
                 
Variable annuity ending account balances increased 21 percent year-over-year to $65 billion from market appreciation and net inflows, including net inflows of $0.4 billion in the Ameriprise channel in the quarter, partially offset by net outflows from the closed book of variable annuities sold through third-party channels.
 
                 
Variable universal life / universal life (VUL/UL) ending account balances increased 13 percent from a year ago to $9.7 billion.
 
                 
The previously announced sale of Securities America is progressing as anticipated. Securities America is now reported as discontinued operations for second quarter 2011 and for all prior periods.
 
Second Quarter 2011 Segment Results
 
 
 
(1)
  
Includes net realized gains and integration/restructuring charges.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
pretax operating earnings increased 26 percent to $108 million due to improved advisor productivity, higher equity markets and new client flows. Pretax operating margin increased to 11.3 percent compared to 10.1 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 12 percent to $957 million due to higher management and distribution fees from growth in assets under management and increased client activity.
 
Operating expenses increased 11 percent to $849 million due to volume-related business growth and investments in the business.
 
Retail client assets grew 20 percent to $319 billion, including strong net inflows in wrap accounts and market appreciation, as well as growth from client acquisition and experienced advisor recruiting.
 
The company continued to increase the productivity of its advisors. Net revenue per advisor was $99,000 in the quarter, a 14 percent increase compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher assets under management and increased client activity. The number of branded advisors increased slightly on a sequential basis, reflecting experienced advisor recruiting and strong advisor retention, partially offset by the departure of lower-producing advisors.
 
 
 
(1)
  
Includes integration/restructuring charges.
(2)
  
Total segment asset and flow results eliminate $998 million of net flows and $5.2 billion of assets in the 2011 quarter and $43 million of net flows and $3.4 billion of assets in the 2010 quarter due to subadvisory relationships between Threadneedle and Columbia Management.
NM Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Asset Management
pretax operating earnings increased 40 percent to $146 million. Earnings in the quarter reflected a full quarter of Columbia earnings compared to two months in the prior year. Earnings growth in the quarter was also driven by asset growth and expense synergies. Adjusted net pretax operating margin, which excludes pass-through distribution expenses, improved to 34.9 percent for the second quarter of 2011, compared to 33.8 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 34 percent to $753 million, reflecting increased management fees, primarily due to growth in assets from market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.
 
Operating expenses increased 33 percent to $607 million due to new product and distribution investments as well as higher Threadneedle equity-based compensation expenses, partially offset by continued expense synergies related to the Columbia acquisition.
 
Segment AUM was $467 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago, and net inflows were $0.5 billion in the quarter. Sequentially, AUM increased $2 billion driven by growth at Threadneedle. Threadneedle AUM increased 3 percent sequentially to $110 billion, primarily from strong retail net inflows and market appreciation.
 
Second quarter 2011 net inflows at Threadneedle were $1.7 billion compared to net outflows of $3.0 billion in the prior quarter and net outflows of $1.1 billion a year ago. European retail redemptions slowed significantly, and excluding outflows in lower-margin Zurich portfolios, Threadneedle had strong institutional net inflows in the quarter.
 
Columbia Management net outflows were $0.2 billion in the quarter compared to net outflows of $2.0 billion in the prior quarter and net outflows of $3.8 billion a year ago. The improvement in net flows reflected lower retail redemptions, improved institutional net flows and reinvested dividends.
 
 
 
 
(1)
  
Includes net realized gains and market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of DAC and DSIC.
(2) 
 2Q10 variable annuity net flows include sales in both Ameriprise and third-party channels. RiverSource Annuities discontinued third-party sales of variable annuities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
NM Not Meaningfulvariance of greater than 100%
 
Annuities
pretax operating earnings increased 46 percent to $149 million, primarily reflecting higher fee revenue from increased variable annuity separate account balances and a significant change in mean reversion compared to a year ago. In addition, the company generated strong fixed annuity returns.
 
Operating net revenues increased 6 percent to $665 million, reflecting increased management fees from higher separate account balances and higher fees from variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decline in operating net investment income.
 
Operating expenses declined 2 percent to $516 million from market impacts on DAC amortization and lower interest credited to client accounts, partially offset by higher distribution expenses from increased variable annuity sales and asset-based compensation. The second quarter of 2011 included a $3 million benefit in DAC and DSIC amortization expenses driven by market impacts on separate account balances (mean reversion) compared to a $35 million negative impact a year ago. In addition, as previously disclosed, second quarter 2010 results included a net benefit of $18 million from model updates and modifications to Portfolio Navigator, a variable annuity asset allocation program.
 
Variable annuity net inflows in the Ameriprise channel essentially doubled to $0.4 billion compared to a year ago, whereas total variable annuity net inflows declined to $0.2 billion for the quarter, reflecting the company's decision to discontinue new sales of variable annuities sold through non-Ameriprise channels. The resulting net flows were in line with expectations. Fixed annuities remained in net outflows due to low client demand given current interest rates.
 
 
 
(1)
  
Includes net realized gains.
 
Protection
pretax operating earnings declined $46 million to $87 million, primarily driven by higher catastrophe losses and continued higher reserve levels for auto liability claims and universal life products with secondary guarantees, as explained below. In addition, the prior year period included the impact of previously disclosed items.
 
Operating net revenues increased slightly to $522 million primarily from auto and home premium growth.
 
Operating expenses increased 13 percent to $435 million. Auto and home results were impacted by $15 million of catastrophe losses as well as $10 million of higher auto liability reserves reflecting elevated reserve levels based on late 2010 experience. Reported auto losses and loss frequency have improved since the fourth quarter of 2010. These trends will be monitored and reflected in reserves in future periods as appropriate. In life and health, claim levels increased compared to the prior year, when they were unusually favorable. In addition, results reflected a $7 million increase in ongoing reserve levels for universal life products with secondary guarantees. The company increased reserve levels for this product beginning in the third quarter of 2010.
 
Life insurance in force remained flat compared to a year ago at $192 billion, and auto and home continued to grow its policy count, up 9 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
 
(1)
  
Includes revenues and expenses of the consolidated investment entities, integration/restructuring charges and net realized gains.
NM  Not Meaningfulvariance of greater than 100%
 
Corporate & Other
pretax operating loss was $41 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $79 million a year ago. Second quarter 2011 results included the recognition of an approximately $27 million pretax gain on an interest rate hedge put in place in anticipation of issuing debt between December 2010 and June 2011. The company did not issue debt and does not plan to issue debt in the foreseeable future.
 
Capital Management
 
                 
The company had more than $2.0 billion in excess capital, with $1.0 billion of cash at the holding company and $1.3 billion in free cash.
 
                 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 6.1 million shares of its common stock for $366 million. As of June 30, 2011, the company had $165 million remaining from its $1.5 billion authorization announced in May 2010 and announced an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization that expires in June 2013.
 
                 
RiverSource Life Insurance Company's estimated risk-based capital ratio was above 585 percent. During the quarter, RiverSource Life paid a $400 million dividend to the holding company.
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $40.5 billion at June 30, 2011 and remains well positioned for continued stress in the credit and commercial mortgage markets. The company's asset liability management programs remain well positioned for a potential increase in interest rates.
 
                 
The company's available-for-sale portfolio ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in net unrealized gains.

Operating return on equity excluding consolidated investment entities and accumulated other comprehensive income is calculated using the trailing twelve months of earnings excluding the after-tax net realized gains/losses, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of DAC and DSIC, integration/restructuring charges, and discontinued operations in the numerator, and Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, the impact of consolidating investment entities, and the assets and liabilities held for sale using a five point average of quarter-end equity in the denominator.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures best reflect the underlying performance of the Company and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.  Accordingly, this Statistical Supplement Package presents the Company's operating results and related operating metrics.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Reconciliation of GAAP Metrics to Operating Metrics" beginning on page 46.
 
Effective for second quarter 2011, management made certain changes in its Statistical Supplement Package:
*Transferred the results of operations attributable to Securities America from the Corporate & Other segment to discontinued operations and restated all periods presented.
 
Management views the operating measures as a more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of its segments, as well as presenting results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses.  Operating measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), net realized gains or losses, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, discontinued operations and integration and restructuring charges.  Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.
 
Operating earnings are adjusted to exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  The market impact includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated hedge asset values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
In addition, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.  In the Asset Management segment, operating revenues are adjusted to exclude distribution pass through revenues and subadvisory and other pass through revenues, and operating earnings are adjusted to exclude operating net investment income and amortization of intangibles.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds. In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched. No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.
 
Data not shown prior to second quarter 2011.  History will be built using the new format going forward.
 
Retail Fund Rankings in Top 2 Morningstar Quartiles or Above Index Benchmark
 
 
The performance of each fund is measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate benchmark - a peer group of similar funds or an index.
 
Equal weighted:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset weighted:  Sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total sum of assets in the funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median or index.
 
Aggregated Allocation (Managed) Funds include funds that invest in other funds of the Threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income.
 
Aggregated Threadneedle data includes funds on the Threadneedle platform sub-advised by Columbia as well as advisors not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients. Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC, formerly known as RiverSource Investments, LLC, predominantly provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Srl (Threadneedle) predominantly provides international investment products and services. Columbia retail products are distributed through our Advice & Wealth Management segment and also through unaffiliated third party financial institutions, including distribution through Bank of America and its affiliates. Institutional products and services are primarily sold through our institutional sales force. Threadneedle retail products are primarily distributed through third parties. Retail products include mutual funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. In addition to the products and services provided to third party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services. The fees for all such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.
 
Annuities -
This segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to retail clients. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2010, our variable annuity products were distributed through affiliated financial advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we discontinued new sales of our variable annuities in non-Ameriprise channels to further strengthen the risk and return characteristics of the business.  Our fixed annuity products are distributed through affiliated advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of RiverSource Variable Series Trust, Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust, Columbia Funds Variable Insurance Trust I and Wanger Advisors Trust funds under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

In a discretionary wrap account, an unaffiliated investment advisor or our investment management subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC, chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client. In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts.
