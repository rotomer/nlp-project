Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Conditions.
 
On October 26, 2011, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2011.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2011.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2011 and 2010 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), non-recourse debt, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding CIEs; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating net investment income; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs.

News Release
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS  October 26, 2011  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported third quarter 2011 net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial of $271 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared to $346 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, a year ago. Operating earnings were $251 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $352 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
Third quarter results were impacted by a negative $106 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, year-over-year change from the unfavorable market impact on deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC), as well as the company's annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and models (unlocking). The negative unlocking impact in the third quarter of 2011 primarily reflects lower near-term interest spread assumptions.
 
Operating net revenues were $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion a year ago, primarily driven by double-digit growth in management and distribution fees. Net investment income was essentially flat year-over-year and reflected the low interest rate environment.
 
Operating return on shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income was 13.4 percent for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011, compared to 12.1 percent for the 12 months ended September 30, 2010.
 
"We continued to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business despite a challenging market environment," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "Operating net revenues increased 8 percent, and we delivered solid underlying business results, apart from the DAC-related impacts. Client acquisition and advisor recruiting remained strong, and our advisor productivity was near all-time highs.
 
"We are maintaining our investments for future growth while managing expenses and our financial foundation prudently. Our financial strength continues to enable us to return significant capital to shareholders. In fact, our excess capital position remains above $2.0 billion even after we accelerated our share repurchase activity, allocating $447 million for share repurchases in the quarter."
 
Third Quarter 2011 Summary
 
In the third quarter of the year, the company conducts an annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations. To the extent that expectations change as a result of this review, the company updates valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of annual unlocking. In addition, lower than assumed returns in both equity and bond funds in variable products resulted in an unfavorable impact for the quarter.
 
The result of these two items negatively impacted the company's year-over-year results by $106 million, or $0.42 per diluted share. The third quarter of 2011 unfavorable impact was $67 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to a benefit of $39 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, a year ago.

The company believes the presentation of operating earnings best represents the economics of the business.
 
The third quarter of 2011 DAC-related impacts reflected:
 
                 
$42 million after-tax, or $0.17 per diluted share, in DAC and DSIC amortization expenses, primarily driven by equity market impacts on separate account balances.
                 
$25 million after-tax, or $0.10 per diluted share, from annual unlocking.
 
In addition, results in the third quarter of 2011 included items that resulted in a net after-tax benefit of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, including:
 
                 
$25 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, of additional bond discount amortization investment income related to prior periods resulting from revisions to the accounting classification of certain structured securities.
                 
$15 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in auto and home insurance catastrophe losses, primarily from Hurricane Irene claims.
                 
$7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in Threadneedle project implementation costs, primarily related to a new transfer agency agreement.
Third Quarter 2011 Business Highlights
 
                 
Total assets under management and administration were $600 billion at September 30, 2011, down 4 percent from a year ago, primarily driven by the point-to-point decline in equity markets and Asset Management segment net outflows, partially offset by retail client net inflows. Total assets under management and administration exclude assets from discontinued operations.
 
                 
Retail client assets in Advice & Wealth Management increased 2 percent year-over-year to $293 billion, primarily reflecting growth in wrap assets, including $0.8 billion in net inflows in the quarter.
 
                 
The number of advisors increased by 51 sequentially to 9,714, reflecting the strongest quarter for experienced advisor recruiting since the second quarter of 2009. Operating net revenue per advisor increased 14 percent from a year ago to $97,000 due to experienced advisor recruiting, higher average assets under management and increased client activity.
 
                 
Asset Management net outflows were $4.8 billion, primarily from $3.1 billion of retail net outflows reflecting the volatile equity markets in the quarter. In the institutional business, Threadneedle had $0.4 billion of net inflows, while Columbia remained in net outflows.
 
                 
Variable annuity ending account balances were flat year-over-year at $59 billion and included $0.4 billion of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel in the quarter, partially offset by net outflows from the closed book of variable annuities sold through third-party channels.
 
                 
RiverSource Life introduced its indexed universal life insurance product to further expand its permanent insurance product suite.
 
                 
Auto and home results included $23 million of pretax catastrophe losses, primarily from storms in the third quarter, including Hurricane Irene, which more than offset lower reserves associated with the favorable development of bodily injury losses.
 
                 
The company launched the next phase of its MORE WITHIN REACH
 brand platform, including television advertising that highlights the company's rich history, financial strength and commitment to clients.
Balance Sheet Summary as of September 30, 2011
 
Excess capital and prudent capital management
 
                 
During the quarter, the company repurchased 9.9 million shares of its common stock for $447 million. Through September 30, 2011, the company repurchased $1.2 billion of shares and has $1.7 billion available in its current share repurchase authorization that expires in June 2013. Even after the increased share repurchases in the quarter, the company continued to maintain more than $2.0 billion in excess capital.
 
                 
RiverSource Life Insurance Company's estimated risk-based capital ratio was above 600 percent.
 
                 
The company's variable annuity hedging program continues to perform well.
 
High-quality investment portfolio

The company's balance sheet has no holdings of sovereign debt in financially troubled European countries.
 
                 
The company's available-for-sale portfolio ended the quarter with $2.0 billio
n in net unrealized gains.
 
                 
Detailed information about the company's investment portfolio is available at ir.ameriprise.com.
 
DAC accounting change  January 1, 2012
 
The company will adopt new accounting rules for the deferral of insurance and annuity acquisition costs on January 1, 2012 on a retrospective basis. The company estimates that the change will reduce its DAC asset by a range of $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion, which will decrease book value by a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion after-tax. The change will not impact the company's strong excess capital position or cash flow. The company estimates that the change will marginally benefit operating earnings in 2012.
 
Taxes
 
The operating effective tax rate was 22.0 percent for the third quarter of 2011 and 24.7 percent year-to-date. The company expects its full-year 2011 operating effective tax rate to be 25 to 27 percent based upon currently forecasted profitability trends.
 
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized losses and integration/restructuring charges.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
pretax operating earnings increased 30 percent to $116 million due to improved advisor productivity and new client flows. Pretax operating margin increased to 12.4 percent compared to 10.7 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 13 percent to $938 million due to higher management and distribution fees from growth in assets under management and increased client activity.
 
Operating expenses increased 11 percent to $822 million due to higher advisor compensation from business growth and investments in the business, including costs of implementing a new brokerage platform.
 
Retail client assets grew 2 percent to $293 billion, with strong retail client flows, partially offset by market declines in the quarter.
 
The company continued to increase the productivity of its advisors. Operating net revenue per advisor was $97,000 in the quarter, a 14 percent increase compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher average assets under management and increased client activity. The number of branded advisors increased for the second consecutive quarter, driven by the strongest quarter for experienced advisor recruiting since the second quarter of 2009 and continued strong advisor retention.
 
 
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized gains and integration/restructuring charges.
(2)  
Total segment asset and flow results eliminate $9 million of net outflows and $4.1 billion of assets in the 2011 quarter and $32 million of net flows and $4.0 billion of assets in the 2010 quarter due to subadvisory relationships between Threadneedle and Columbia Management.
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Asset Management
pretax operating earnings declined 2 percent to $119 million compared to the prior year. Results in the quarter include a $10 million expense primarily related to Threadneedle changing its transfer agent provider, which is expected to enhance margins over time. Adjusted net pretax operating margin, which excludes pass-through distribution expenses, was 32.7 percent for the third quarter of 2011, compared to 33.0 percent a year ago. The Threadneedle project expenses in the quarter lowered adjusted net pretax operating margin by 2.4 percentage points.
 
Operating net revenues increased 7 percent to $705 million, reflecting increased management fees, primarily due to growth in average assets, partially offset by net outflows.
 
Operating expenses increased 9 percent to $586 million. Adjusting for the Threadneedle transfer agent costs, operating expenses increased 7 percent, driven by higher distribution expenses as a result of higher year-over-year average retail balances. General and administrative expenses remain well controlled.
 
Total segment ending AUM was $417 billion, down 6 percent from a year ago driven by net outflows and market depreciation.
 
Columbia Management had $4.1 billion of net outflows in the quarter, evenly divided between retail and institutional channels. Retail outflows were primarily in equity portfolios and were in line with industry trends. Institutional outflows at Columbia Management were primarily comprised of lower-fee, former parent-company relationships where the assets are expected to continue to transition over time and fluctuate quarter to quarter.
 
Threadneedle had a total of $0.8 billion of net outflows in the quarter, comprised of $1.2 billion of retail outflows primarily from European clients, partially offset by $0.4 billion of institutional net inflows. Institutional net flows were positive as new mandates in the Middle East more than offset continued run-off of low-margin Zurich assets.
 
 
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized losses and market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of DAC and DSIC.
(2)  
3Q10 variable annuity net inflows include sales in both Ameriprise and third-party channels. The company discontinued new sales of variable annuities in third-party channels in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Annuities
pretax operating earnings declined 68 percent to $82 million reflecting the unfavorable $183 million year-over-year change in DAC-related impacts, partially offset by a benefit from investment income recognition. In addition, operating earnings were negatively impacted by spread compression in fixed annuities and higher distribution expenses.
 
Operating net revenues increased 10 percent to $688 million, driven by the benefit of recognizing certain investment income in the quarter, as well as higher management fees from increased average separate account balances and higher variable annuity rider fees. This growth was partially offset by the impact of the low interest rate environment on net investment income.
 
Operating expenses increased 64 percent to $606 million reflecting the significant year-over-year change from market-driven impacts on DAC and DSIC, as well as unlocking. Excluding these impacts, expenses reflected higher variable annuity distribution expenses and DAC amortization from the higher separate account balances, partially offset by lower interest credited.
 
RiverSource variable annuity net inflows in the Ameriprise channel declined 16 percent from a year ago to $0.4 billion. Fixed annuities remained in net outflows due to low client demand given current interest rates.
 
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized losses.
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Protection
pretax operating earnings declined 3 percent to $65 million driven by auto and home catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower DAC-related items and improved life and health claims experience.
 
Operating net revenues were flat at $502 million as auto and home premium growth was largely offset by a decline in life and health revenues.
 
Operating expenses were up slightly to $437 million. In life and health, expenses declined from reduced claims as well as from lower year-over-year DAC-related impacts. In auto and home, expenses increased, reflecting $23 million in catastrophe losses. On a sequential basis, reported auto losses and loss frequency have continued to improve since the fourth quarter of 2010. These trends were partially reflected in third quarter results and will be monitored and reflected in reserves in future periods, as appropriate.
 
Life insurance in force remained essentially flat compared to a year ago at $191 billion, and Auto & Home continued to grow its policy count, up 8 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
 
(1)  
Includes revenues and expenses of the consolidated investment entities and net realized gains.
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Corporate & Other
pretax operating loss was $60 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $47 million a year ago.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures best reflect the underlying performance of the Company and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.  Accordingly, this Statistical Supplement Package presents the Company's operating results and related operating metrics.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Reconciliation of GAAP Metrics to Operating Metrics" beginning on page 46.
 
Management views the operating measures as a more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of its segments, as well as presenting results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses.  Operating measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), net realized gains or losses, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, discontinued operations and integration and restructuring charges.  Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.
 
Operating earnings are adjusted to exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  The market impact includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated hedge asset values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
In addition, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.  In the Asset Management segment, operating revenues are adjusted to exclude distribution pass through revenues and subadvisory and other pass through revenues, and operating earnings are adjusted to exclude operating net investment income and amortization of intangibles.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.  In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched.  No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.
 
Data not shown prior to second quarter 2011.  History will be built using the new format going forward.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients. Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC (Columbia) predominantly provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Srl (Threadneedle) predominantly provides international investment products and services.

Our fixed annuity products are distributed through affiliated advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.

In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts.
