Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 1, 2012, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2011.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2011 and 2010 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), non-recourse debt, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding CIEs; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating net investment income; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs.

News Release
 
                 
Fourth quarter 2011 operating earnings per diluted share were $1.33. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial per diluted share was $1.02.
 
                 
Full year 2011 operating earnings per diluted share were a record $5.00. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial per diluted share was $4.61.
 
MINNEAPOLIS  February 1, 2012  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported fourth quarter 2011 operating earnings of $312 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $340 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, a year ago. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $240 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, compared to $306 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
The decline in fourth quarter 2011 operating earnings primarily reflected lower revenues compared to a year ago. Fourth quarter 2011 operating net revenues declined 2 percent to $2.5 billion from lower hedge fund performance fees, the continued low interest rate environment, and the impact of market volatility, partially offset by growth in asset-based fees from retail client net inflows.
 
On a full-year basis, the company delivered record operating earnings and net revenues driven by strong growth in its fee-based advisory and asset management businesses. Compared to 2010, operating net revenues grew 10 percent to $10.1 billion, operating earnings grew 4 percent to $1.2 billion, and operating earnings per diluted share increased 10 percent to $5.00.
 
The company's excess capital position remained above $2.0 billion at year-end 2011, even after deploying $248 million to repurchase approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock during the quarter. In 2011, the company returned $1.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which represented 135 percent of full year operating earnings. The company also announced a $0.05 per share, or 22 percent, increase in the company's regular quarterly dividend payable on February 24, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 10, 2012.
 
Operating return on shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income was 13.1 percent for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 12.9 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010.
 
"We delivered another good quarter and a strong year," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite the impact of volatile markets and low interest rates on our revenues, we continued to make significant progress. Our advisory business generated excellent results for the year, highlighted by record advisor productivity and accelerating success in our experienced advisor recruiting program. In the asset management business, equity flows remained negative for us and the industry. Apart from this near-term challenge, we feel very good about the global platform we've developed now that we have integrated Columbia Management and with Threadneedle expanding to new geographic markets."
"Our exceptionally strong financial foundation continues to enable us to make targeted, strategic investments for growth. In fact, during the fourth quarter we increased our investment spending, most notably to build our brand further through national advertising and to convert to our new brokerage platform. That said, we will maintain and accelerate our focus on re-engineering and expense management to adjust for market challenges."
 
Fourth Quarter Summary
 
 
 
(1)  
Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
The company believes the presentation of operating earnings best represents the economics of the business. Operating earnings exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities, net realized gains or losses, integration and restructuring charges, the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC), and income or loss from discontinued operations.
 
Compared to a year ago, fourth quarter 2011 operating earnings included a $1 million net after-tax benefit from the market impact on insurance and annuity DAC and DSIC. The after-tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $18 million compared to $17 million a year ago. There are other items detailed in segment results that in the aggregate had an immaterial impact on consolidated financial results.
 
Fourth Quarter 2011 Highlights
 
While equity market volatility in the second half of 2011 and the continued low interest rate environment created a challenging market environment for the industry, the company continues to make significant progress.
 
                 
Total assets under management and administration were $631 billion at December 31, 2011, up 5 percent sequentially driven by Asset Management net inflows and market appreciation.
 
                 
Asset Management net inflows were $4.3 billion in the quarter, driven by a $14 billion inflow at Threadneedle from a strategic relationship with Liverpool Victoria to manage its insurance and pension fund portfolio. The agreement represented a major institutional win and added significant scale to Threadneedle's fixed income business. Asset Management net inflows in the quarter were partially offset by $6.7 billion in outflows of previously announced, low basis point, former parent company assets.
 
                 
At year end, the company had 113 four- and five-star Morningstar rated funds, including 52 Columbia funds and 61 Threadneedle funds.
 
                 
The fourth quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of an increased advisor count, with 105 experienced advisors joining Ameriprise. Compared to a year ago, the number of advisors grew 1 percent
 
to 9,730, reflecting strong advisor retention and experienced advisor recruiting. Operating net revenue per advisor increased 12 percent in 2011 to a record $384,000.
 
                 
The company launched the next phase of its MORE WITHIN REACH
 advertising campaign with expanded advertising and local marketing to deepen Ameriprise Financial brand awareness and support client and advisor acquisition.
 
                 
The company is executing a multi-year investment to transition advisors to a new brokerage platform. During the quarter, the first group of franchisee advisors converted to the new platform, and the company will continue to make additional investments in the platform in 2012.
 
                 
During the quarter, the company launched financial planning and advisory services in India focused on serving consumers in Mumbai and Delhi-NCR.
 
                 
RiverSource Life generated strong sales of its newly launched indexed universal life insurance product.
 
                 
Ameriprise ranked #1 in life insurance customer satisfaction in a recent survey by insure.com.
 
                 
Ameriprise Auto & Home had a solid fourth quarter. Compared to a year ago, policies in force grew by 7 percent and claims were favorable as auto liability claims returned to levels more consistent with historic experience and weather-related claims improved significantly.
 
Balance Sheet Summary as of December 31, 2011
 
Excess capital and prudent capital management
 
                 
The company's excess capital position remained above $2.0 billion at year-end 2011.
 
                 
The company repurchased 5.5 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2011 for $248 million. In 2011, the company returned $1.7 billion to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends, which represented 135 percent of full year operating earnings.
 
                 
During the quarter, RiverSource Life paid an $850 million dividend to the holding company. RiverSource Life's preliminary year-end 2011 risk-based capital ratio was approximately 490 percent.
 
                 
Cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 billion, with $700 million at the holding company and $650 million in free cash. The holding company has $850 million in high-quality, short-duration securities from the RiverSource Life dividend.
 
                 
The company's variable annuity hedging program continues to perform well, including during a volatile second half of the year.
 
High-quality investment portfolio
 
                 
The total investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was $41.6 billion and remains well positioned. The company's balance sheet has no holdings of sovereign debt in financially troubled European countries. There were $11 million of impairments in the quarter, primarily associated with residential mortgage-backed securities.

Segment Summaries
 
 
 
 
(1) 
 Includes net realized gains/losses.
 
Advice & Wealth Management
fourth quarter 2011 pretax operating earnings declined 14 percent from a year ago to $83 million as retail client asset growth was offset by the negative impact of market volatility and increased investments to drive advisor business growth.
 
Revenue growth slowed to 1 percent as asset growth was partially offset by the impact of market volatility. Total retail client assets grew 2 percent to $310 billion, including $1.4 billion in wrap net inflows in the quarter. However, during the quarter, clients increased cash balances and transactional volumes declined modestly. Earnings from cash accounts remained low due to the interest rate environment.
 
Operating net revenue per advisor was $93,000 in the quarter, which was unchanged compared to a year ago, reflecting the impact of market volatility. On a full-year basis, operating net revenue per advisor increased 12 percent to a record $384,000, reflecting retail net inflows, experienced advisor recruiting and market appreciation.
 
Operating expenses increased 3 percent, primarily from a $14 million increase in advertising and technology investments. The company launched the next phase of its advertising campaign aimed at increasing brand awareness to support client acquisition and experienced advisor recruiting. The company is also executing a multi-year investment to install a new brokerage technology platform. During the quarter, approximately 500 franchise advisors converted to the new platform, and the company expects to have all advisors on the platform by the end of 2012.
 
Fourth quarter 2011 pretax operating margin was 9.2 percent compared to 10.7 percent a year ago, reflecting increased investments in the business. On a full-year basis, pretax operating margin was 10.9 percent compared to 9.6 percent in 2010.
 
 
 
 
Asset Management
pretax operating earnings declined $36 million from a year ago to $127 million. Earnings in the year ago quarter included $22 million associated with hedge fund performance compared to only $1 million in the current quarter. Fourth quarter 2011 earnings also reflected the impact of net outflows, market depreciation and increased advertising expense, partially offset by a benefit from the liquidation of a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) structure.
 
Operating net revenues declined 9 percent to $702 million, largely driven by $57 million in lower hedge fund performance fees than a year ago. In addition, revenues reflected the impact of net outflows in assets under management and market depreciation, partially offset by the CDO liquidation benefit.
 
Operating expenses declined 6 percent to $575 million, primarily due to $36 million in lower hedge fund performance compensation as well as lower general and administrative expenses associated with expense synergies, which were offset by increased advertising expense.
 
Adjusted net pretax operating margin, which excludes pass-through distribution expenses, was 31.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 34.1 percent a year ago. On a full-year basis, adjusted net pretax operating margin was 33.2 percent compared to 30.1 percent in 2010.
 
Total segment assets under management declined 5 percent from a year ago to $436 billion, as 8 percent asset growth at Threadneedle was more than offset by outflows at Columbia Management. Threadneedle generated $12.6 billion in net inflows in the quarter, reflecting approximately $14 billion from a strategic relationship with Liverpool Victoria to manage its insurance and pension fund portfolio. Columbia Management net outflows of $8.4 billion in the quarter were largely driven by $6.7 billion of previously announced outflows of low basis point, former parent company assets, as well as net outflows in subadvised funds. In addition, during the quarter, a former parent-related program sponsor shifted $4.7 billion from a traditional separately managed account platform to a model-delivery only unified managed account platform
 
that utilizes Columbia models. While the assets are excluded from managed assets, the movement in assets was neutral to earnings.
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized gains and market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of DAC and DSIC.
(2)  
4Q10 variable annuity net flows include sales in both Ameriprise and third-party channels. RiverSource Annuities discontinued third-party sales of variable annuities in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Annuities
pretax operating earnings increased 2 percent to $174 million as growth in variable annuity earnings was partially offset by a decline in fixed annuity earnings. Variable annuity earnings growth reflected client net inflows and a benefit from enhancing the variable annuity guaranteed benefit valuation model, partially offset by the impact of low rates on assets backing fixed accounts. Fixed annuity earnings were impacted by the continued low rate environment and an $8 million unfavorable adjustment in the liability for a closed book of indexed annuities.
 
Operating net revenues declined 1 percent to $634 million, primarily driven by $21 million of higher variable annuity rider fees and management fees from increased average separate account balances that were more than offset by a $25 million decline in net investment income from low interest rates, primarily in fixed annuities.
 
Operating expenses declined 2 percent to $460 million, reflecting lower interest credited expenses, favorable market impacts on benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, as well as lower DAC amortization.
 
RiverSource variable annuity net inflows in the Ameriprise channel declined 7 percent from a year ago to $442 million. Fixed annuities remained in net outflows due to low client demand given current interest rates.
 
 
(1)  
Includes net realized losses.
 
Protection
pretax operating earnings increased 30 percent to $109 million, driven by improvement in auto and home earnings and favorable life and health claims compared to a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 1 percent to $529 million as auto and home premium growth was largely offset by a decline in life and health investment income due to the low interest rate environment.
 
Operating expenses declined 5 percent to $420 million from favorable claims in both the life and health and auto and home businesses. Auto and home claims in the fourth quarter of 2010 included $11 million from catastrophe losses, as well as elevated auto liability claims. Over the past four quarters, reported auto losses and loss frequency have continued to improve and are currently at levels more consistent with historic experience.
 
Life insurance in force declined slightly from a year ago to $191 billion, and Auto & Home continued to grow its policy count, up 7 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
Corporate & Other
pretax operating loss was $75 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $68 million a year ago. The fourth quarter of 2011 included an $8 million increase in enterprise investments.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures best reflect the underlying performance of the Company and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.  Accordingly, this Statistical Supplement Package presents the Company's operating results and related operating metrics.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Reconciliation of GAAP Metrics to Operating Metrics" beginning on page 46.
 
Management views the operating measures as a more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of its segments, as well as presenting results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses.  Operating measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"); net realized gains or losses; market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of DAC and DSIC; discontinued operations; and integration and restructuring charges.  Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.
 
Operating earnings are adjusted to exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  The market impact includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated hedge asset values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
In addition, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.  In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched.  No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs.

We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

Our fixed annuity products are distributed through affiliated advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.
