Item 7.01       Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On March 12, 2012, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") made available a revised Statistical Supplement to illustrate the anticipated changes to the presentation of the Company's financial results through the fourth quarter of 2011  as a result of the retrospective adoption, effective January 1, 2012, of Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-26 (previously referred to as EITF Issue No. 09-G).  The revised Statistical Supplement also reflects certain unrelated expense reclassifications.  The Company is making this information available to provide investors an opportunity to become familiar with the expected impact of the accounting standard update to its financial results and the presentation thereof prior to the Company's earnings release for the quarter ending March 31, 2012.  A copy of the Statistical Supplement is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Statistical Supplement includes information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. The Statistical Supplement also contains certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), non-recourse debt, fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in the Statistical Supplement, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding CIEs; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating net investment income; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding non-recourse debt for inverse floaters, fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, non-recourse debt for inverse floaters and equity of CIEs.
 
Item 9.01       Financial Statements and Exhibits.

Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") retrospectively adopted the updated accounting standard for deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") on January 1, 2012.  In order to provide investors the opportunity to become familiar with the expected impact of this accounting standard update on the Company's financial results and the presentation thereof prior to the upcoming earnings announcement, the Company is providing this revised Statistical Supplement using historical financial results through the quarter ended December 31, 2011.  For comparative purposes, the Statistical Supplement originally provided in connection with the earnings release for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 remains available at ir.ameriprise.com.
 
The cumulative effect of the adoption of the accounting standard update is the reduction of shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, by $1.4 billion after-tax.  The impacts to the consolidated and segment income statements primarily affected "Distribution expenses," "Amortization of deferred acquisition costs," and "General and administrative expense."  The Protection and Annuities segments were the primary segments impacted.  Impacts to Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management segments were limited to operating return on allocated equity due to the change in the effective tax rate.
 
As a result of adopting the updated accounting standard, fewer costs are eligible for deferral, resulting in:
     
a lower DAC asset balance
     
lower amortization of DAC
     
higher distribution expenses, and
     
higher general and administrative expense
 
In addition, for the Asset Management segment, certain transfer agent expenses have been reclassified from "General and administrative expense" to "Distribution expenses," consistent with how we classify other transfer agent payments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures best reflect the underlying performance of the Company and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.  Accordingly, this Statistical Supplement Package presents the Company's operating results and related operating metrics.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Reconciliation of GAAP Metrics to Operating Metrics" beginning on page 46.
 
Management views the operating measures as a more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of its segments, as well as presenting results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses.  Operating measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"); net realized gains or losses; market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducement costs ("DSIC") amortization; discontinued operations; and integration and restructuring charges.  Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.
 
Operating earnings are adjusted to exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  The market impact includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated hedge asset values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives. 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
In addition, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.  In the Asset Management segment, operating revenues are adjusted to exclude distribution pass through revenues and subadvisory and other pass through revenues, and operating earnings are adjusted to exclude operating net investment income and amortization of intangibles.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.  In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched.  No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.
 
Data not shown prior to second quarter 2011.  History will be built using the new format going forward.
Retail Fund Rankings in Top 2 Morningstar Quartiles or Above Index Benchmark
 
 
The performance of each fund is measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate benchmark - a peer group of similar funds or an index.
 
Equal weighted:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset weighted:  Sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total sum of assets in the funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median or index.
 
Aggregated Allocation (Managed) Funds include funds that invest in other funds of the Threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income.
 
Aggregated Threadneedle data includes funds on the Threadneedle platform sub-advised by Columbia as well as advisors not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients. Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC (Columbia) predominantly provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Srl (Threadneedle) predominantly provides international investment products and services. Columbia retail products are distributed through our Advice & Wealth Management segment and also through unaffiliated third party financial institutions, including distribution through Bank of America and its affiliates. Institutional products and services are primarily sold through our institutional sales force. Threadneedle retail products are primarily distributed through third parties. Retail products include mutual funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. In addition to the products and services provided to third party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services. The fees for all such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.
 
Annuities -
This segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to retail clients. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2010, our variable annuity products were distributed through affiliated financial advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we discontinued new sales of our variable annuities in non-Ameriprise channels to further strengthen the risk and return characteristics of the business.  Our fixed annuity products are distributed through affiliated advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of certain funds under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Protection -
This segment offers a variety of protection products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients including life, disability income and property-casualty insurance. Life and disability income products are primarily distributed through Ameriprise advisors. Our property-casualty products are sold direct, primarily through affinity relationships. We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and property casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees, and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on invested assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by the Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of certain funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Corporate & Other -
This segment consists of net investment income on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues from various investments as well as unallocated corporate expenses.
 
 
Adjusted Net Pretax Operating Margin -
An internal measure designed to calculate operating margins similar to how asset management companies define operating margins. A ratio representing adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of adjusted operating revenues for the asset management segment.
 
Adjusted Operating Earnings
- Asset management segment pretax operating earnings less operating net investment income plus amortization of intangibles.
 
Adjusted Operating Revenues -
The following is a list of items subtracted from asset management segment operating total net revenues to arrive at Adjusted Operating Revenues:  operating net investment income, pass through distribution revenue, other pass through fees and subadvisory expenses.
 
Allocated Equity -
The internal allocation of consolidated Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), CIEs, and the net of assets and liabilities held for sale is based on management's best estimate of capital required by the business, and may include capital for contingencies.  Equity is allocated to our operating segments for purposes of measuring segment return on allocated equity.  Allocated equity does not represent insurance company risk-based capital or other regulatory capital requirements applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries.  For the Corporate & Other segment, allocated equity also includes any equity available after equity has been allocated to the operating segments. Allocated equity is not adjusted for non-operating items except for CIEs and the net of assets and liabilities held for sale.
 
Alternative Assets

Ameriprise Financial -
Ameriprise Financial includes ownership interests in subsidiaries that are attributable, directly or indirectly, to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and excludes noncontrolling interests.

Assets Under Administration -
Assets under administration include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies' products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients' brokerage accounts. We generally record fees received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets under administration also include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.
 
Assets Under Management -
Assets under management include assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia funds and Threadneedle funds, assets of institutional clients, and client assets held in wrap and personal trust accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us.

Cash Sales
- Cash sales are the dollar value volume indicator that captures gross new cash inflows which generate product revenue streams to our company. This includes primarily "client initiated" activity that results in an incremental increase in assets or premiums in force (but doesn't need to result in time of sale revenue), or activity that doesn't increase assets or premiums in force, but generates "fee revenue".
 
Consolidated Investment Entities ("CIEs") -
CIEs include certain property and hedge funds as well as the variable interest entities required to be consolidated under current accounting standards.
 
DAC Rollforward Other -
We record unrealized securities gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income tax provision (benefit) and net of adjustments in other asset and liability balances, such as DAC, to reflect the expected impact on their carrying values had the unrealized securities gains (losses) been realized as of the respective balance sheet dates.
 
Deferred Acquisition Costs and Amortization
- Deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") represent the direct costs of acquiring new protection and annuity contracts, principally direct sales commissions and other distribution and underwriting costs that have been deferred on the sale of life, disability income, long term care, auto, and home insurance and annuities.  DAC also includes deferred direct sales commissions on certain mutual fund products. These costs are deferred to the extent they are directly related to the acquisition of new business and are recoverable from future profits.
 
FAS 157 Valuation Impact -
The portion of the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits related to liability valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157") that management considers to be non-economic, including the impact of discounting projected benefits at a rate reflecting a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.

Wrap Accounts
- Wrap accounts enable our clients to purchase other securities such as mutual funds in connection with investment advisory fee-based "wrap account" programs or services. We offer clients the opportunity to select products that include affiliated and non-affiliated funds. We currently offer both discretionary and non-discretionary investment advisory wrap accounts. In a discretionary wrap account, an unaffiliated investment advisor or our investment management subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC, chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client. In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts. These investors also pay any related fees or costs included in the underlying securities held in that account, such as underlying mutual fund operating expenses and Rule 12b-1 fees.
