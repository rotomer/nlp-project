Item 2.02       Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On April 23, 2012, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2012.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2012.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2012 and 2011 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding CIEs; operating earnings (loss); operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating net investment income; operating return on allocated equity; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings (loss); pretax operating margin; return on allocated equity; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs.

News Release
 
MINNEAPOLIS  April 23, 2012  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported first quarter 2012  operating earnings of $335 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to $344 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, a year ago. Net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial for the first quarter of 2012 was $245 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared to $312 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
First quarter 2012 operating net revenues increased 1 percent from a year ago as growth in asset-based fees from retail client net inflows and market appreciation was largely offset by a decline in net investment income from low interest rates. Operating earnings declined 3 percent from a year ago reflecting a higher tax rate as well as the negative impact of low interest rates.
 
The company has a strong financial foundation and continues to generate free cash flow. During the quarter, the company returned $364 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which represented nearly 110 percent of first quarter 2012 operating earnings.
 
The company also announced a 25 percent, or $0.07 per share, increase to its regular quarterly dividend. Over the past 12 months, the company has declared three quarterly dividend increases, which in total increased the regular quarterly dividend by 94 percent. The company remains in a strong excess capital position.
 
Operating return on shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income was 16.0 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2012, compared to 14.9 percent a year ago.
 
"We had a solid quarter, generating good earnings and fee-based business growth, which helped to offset the negative interest rate environment," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our results reflect the benefits of our diversified business model and the strength of our balance sheet."
 
"While client investment activity improved during the quarter, clients continued to increase cash balances and remained cautious about the slow pace of the economic recovery. We're making good progress on our key priorities, including enhancing our brand awareness, growing advisor productivity, attracting more experienced advisors to Ameriprise and expanding our core client base.
 
"The strong free cash we're generating gives us the platform to maintain growth investments while continuing to repurchase our shares and increase our dividend significantly. In fact, over the past year we've nearly doubled our quarterly dividend, demonstrating our ability to both deliver solid results and a strong return to shareholders. In this fragile economic environment, our business remains strong and diversified.
 
First Quarter 2012 Summary
 
 
 
(1)  
Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
The company believes the presentation of operating earnings best represents the economics of the business. Operating earnings, after-tax, exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities; net realized gains or losses; integration and restructuring charges; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of hedges and related deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) amortization; and income or loss from discontinued operations.
 
First quarter 2012 operating earnings included a $17 million net after-tax benefit from the market impact on insurance and annuity DAC and DSIC, compared to a $7 million benefit a year ago. In addition, Annuities segment earnings included a $13 million after-tax benefit from model updates and enhancements, compared to a $3 million after-tax benefit in the first quarter of 2011.
 
First Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
                 
Total assets under management and administration were $675 billion at March 31, 2012, up 1 percent from a year ago and up 7 percent sequentially, driven by retail client net inflows and market appreciation.

The first quarter of 2012 represented the fourth consecutive quarter of an increased advisor count, with 117 experienced advisors joining Ameriprise.

first quarter 2012 pretax operating earnings declined 5 percent from a year ago to $94 million.

NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Annuities
pretax operating earnings increased 10 percent to $189 million, primarily from growth in variable annuity earnings, partially offset by a decline in investment income reflecting dividends paid to the holding company in 2011 and low interest rates impacting both the variable and fixed businesses. Variable annuity earnings were $133 million compared with $99 million a year ago. Variable annuity earnings in the quarter included a $44 million benefit from the market impact on DAC and DSIC as well as model updates and enhancements, compared to a net benefit of $14 million from these items a year ago. Fixed annuity earnings declined $17 million to $56 million, primarily from the continued low interest rate environment and lower account balances.

(1)  
Includes net realized gains.

Operating net revenues increased 1 percent to $522 million as auto and home premium growth was largely offset by a decline in life and health revenues resulting from a modest decline in life insurance in force and lower investment income reflecting dividends paid to the holding company in 2011.  Operating expenses increased 2 percent to $415 million, primarily driven by increased new business volume in auto and home and higher long term care claims.
 
Life insurance in force remained essentially unchanged at $191 billion, and Auto & Home continued to grow its policy count, up 7 percent compared to a year ago.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures best reflect the underlying performance of the Company and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis.  Accordingly, this Statistical Supplement Package presents the Company's operating results and related operating metrics.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Reconciliation of GAAP Metrics to Operating Metrics" beginning on page 46.
 
Management views the operating measures as a more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of its segments, as well as presenting results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the businesses.  Operating measures exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"); net realized gains or losses; market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") and deferred sales inducement costs ("DSIC") amortization; discontinued operations; and integration and restructuring charges.  Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors.
 
Operating earnings are adjusted to exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits.  The market impact includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated hedge asset values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("FAS 157"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
 
Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.  In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched.  No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.
 
Data not shown prior to second quarter 2011.  History will be built using the new format going forward.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients. Columbia Management Investment Advisors, LLC (Columbia) predominantly provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Srl (Threadneedle) predominantly provides international investment products and services. Columbia retail products are distributed through our Advice & Wealth Management segment and also through unaffiliated third party financial institutions, including distribution through Bank of America and its affiliates. Institutional products and services are primarily sold through our institutional sales force. Threadneedle retail products are primarily distributed through third parties. Retail products include mutual funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations, hedge funds, collective funds and property funds. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. In addition to the products and services provided to third party clients, management teams serving our Asset Management segment provide all intercompany asset management services. The fees for all such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management, Annuities and Protection segments.
 
Annuities -
This segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to retail clients. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2010, our variable annuity products were distributed through affiliated financial advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we discontinued new sales of our variable annuities in non-Ameriprise channels to further strengthen the risk and return characteristics of the business.  Our fixed annuity products are distributed through affiliated advisors as well as unaffiliated advisors through third-party distribution. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of certain funds under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

We issue insurance policies through our life insurance subsidiaries and property casualty companies. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees, and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on invested assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of assets supporting variable universal life separate account balances. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by the Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of certain funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.

In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts.
