Item 2.02      Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On July 25, 2012, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2012.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2012.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2012 and 2011 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests; operating earnings; operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating return on equity excluding CIEs and AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings; pretax operating margin; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs.

News Release
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS  July 25, 2012  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported second quarter 2012 net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial of $224 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, compared to $319 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, a year ago. Second quarter 2012 operating earnings were $254 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared to $333 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, a year ago. Results in the quarter included $57 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, of unfavorable items, including a $40 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, unfavorable impact from an unusual tax-related item primarily related to prior periods. In addition, the year-ago period included an $18 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, after-tax gain from an interest rate hedge.
 
Second quarter 2012 operating net revenues were $2.5 billion, a 3 percent decline from a year ago, primarily due to lower net investment income from continued low interest rates and volatile equity markets. These market-driven impacts were partially offset by growth in fee-based revenues driven by Ameriprise advisor client net inflows.
 
Second quarter 2012 operating expenses were $2.1 billion, down 1 percent from a year ago. Operating general and administrative expenses improved from a year ago reflecting ongoing expense control initiatives and continued investments in the business.
 
The company maintains a strong financial foundation and continues to generate free cash flow. During the quarter, the company returned $428 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
 
Return on shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) was 12.3 percent for the 12 months ended June 30, 2012. Operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 15.2 percent, compared to 15.5 percent a year ago.
 
"Our business results were solid considering the difficult markets during the quarter," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer.
 
"We experienced good advisor client and asset growth with strong net inflows in our fee-based products. In Asset Management, we completed the Columbia Management integration and now have a strong global asset management platform.
 
"Earlier this month, we announced our plan to transition our federal savings bank subsidiary to a non-depository national trust bank by year end. Our advisors will continue to meet clients' deposit and borrowing needs through leading third-party banks, and our shareholders will benefit from the additional capital flexibility.
"We continue to maintain our balance sheet strength and are generating strong free cash flow to both invest as well as return to shareholders. In fact, over the past six quarters we've returned more than 130 percent of our operating earnings to shareholders."
 
Second Quarter 2012 Summary
 
 
 
(1)      
Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
The company believes the presentation of operating earnings best represents the economics of the business. Operating earnings, after-tax, exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities; net realized gains or losses; integration and restructuring charges; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of hedges and related deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) amortization; and income or loss from discontinued operations.
 
Second quarter operating earnings included the following after-tax items:
 
 
Information about these and other items included in operating earnings are provided in the segment summaries.
 
Taxes
 
Results in the quarter included a $40 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, unfavorable impact from an unusual tax-related item primarily related to prior periods. During the quarter, the company discovered it had received incomplete data from a third-party service provider for securities lending activities that resulted in the miscalculation of the company's tax position and reported earnings in prior periods. The company has resolved the data issue and stopped the securities lending that negatively impacted its tax position.
The second quarter 2012 operating effective tax rate was 36.3 percent, compared to 27.5 percent in the second quarter of 2011. As a result of the tax item, the expected full year tax rate will increase to the 28 to 30 percent range.
 
Second Quarter 2012 Business Highlights
 
                 
Ameriprise client assets grew 4 percent from a year ago to $331 billion driven by strong net inflows.
 
                 
Wrap assets grew 7 percent to $113 billion, including $2.6 billion of wrap net inflows in the quarter, a 12 percent increase from a year ago.
 
                 
The second quarter of 2012 represented the fifth consecutive quarter of an increased advisor count. The company continued to have success recruiting experienced advisors, adding 91 advisors in the quarter and more than 400 over the last year.
 
                 
The company successfully completed the second phase of its brokerage platform conversion for franchise advisors and is on track to complete the project in the coming months.
 
                 
At June 30, 2012, the company had 116 four- and five-star Morningstar-rated funds, including 56 Columbia Management funds and 60 Threadneedle funds.
 
                 
During the quarter, Threadneedle improved its ranking to become the third largest U.K. retail fund provider by assets under management.

Columbia Management continued to expand its product offerings, launching the Columbia Risk Allocation Fund, an open-end fund focused on allocating risk, rather than capital.
 
                 
The company made several changes to its variable annuity product offerings during the quarter to appropriately manage risk in the current market environment. In May, it introduced a new variable annuity rider that requires asset allocation into a managed volatility fund and is designed to provide clients with built-in flexibility to adapt to volatile market conditions. In addition, the company ceased sales of several guarantee riders and restricted most add-on premiums.
 
                 
RiverSource Life continued to generate strong sales of its indexed universal life insurance product with total life and disability insurance cash sales increasing each of the last three quarters. Ameriprise Auto & Home continued to generate solid core business results with policies in force growing a steady 7 percent.
 
                 
The company released additional findings from its
Money Across Generations II
SM
research study, which offers an in-depth look across three generations of Americans  baby boomers, their adult children and their aging parents  to reveal how the changing financial needs and attitudes of each generation have altered their relationship with money and with each other.

On July 10, 2012, the company announced its intention to transition its federal savings bank subsidiary, Ameriprise Bank, FSB, to a non-depository national trust bank by year-end 2012, subject to regulatory approvals. With this change, Ameriprise Financial would not be considered a savings and loan holding company. Upon completion of this transition, the company expects that the earnings per share impact will be immaterialthe financial impact to its Advice & Wealth Management segment will be largely offset by the anticipated redeployment of capital into share repurchases.
Balance Sheet Summary as of June 30, 2012
 
Excess capital position and prudent capital management

Excess capital continues to remain above $2.0 billion after the return of $428 million to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.
 
                 
The company repurchased 7 million shares of its common stock in the quarter for $350 million.

Segment Summaries
 
 
 
 
Advice & Wealth Management
pretax operating earnings increased 3 percent from a year ago to $111 million, reflecting strong growth in asset-based fees and expense management. Growth was partially offset by a $10 million impact from low interest rates, as well as lower transactional revenues.
 
Operating net revenues were essentially flat at $953 million, reflecting advisor business growth and client net inflows offset by the impact of a lower asset earnings rate on cash balances and lower transactional volumes related to volatile markets and the introduction of a new variable annuity rider. Total retail client assets grew 4 percent to $331 billion, including $2.6 billion in wrap net inflows in the quarter and $1.3 billion of higher cash balances compared to a year ago. Operating net revenue per advisor was $97,000 for the quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago, reflecting the volatile market environment that impacted transactional-based revenues.
 
Operating expenses improved 1 percent to $842 million, primarily reflecting lower distribution expenses. The company is committed to maintaining its expense management initiatives while making prudent investments for growth, including investing in the Ameriprise Financial brand, recruiting experienced advisors and transitioning advisors to a new brokerage technology platform. The final group of advisors is expected to transfer to the new platform in the coming months.
 
Second quarter 2012 pretax operating margin increased to 11.6 percent, compared to 11.3 percent a year ago and 9.9 percent sequentially, reflecting improved expenses that helped to offset the impact from low interest rates.

Subadvisory eliminations between Columbia Management and Threadneedle are included in the company's Second Quarter 2012 Statistical Supplement available at ir.ameriprise.com.
(2)   
Excludes $(1.2) billion and $1.0 billion in intercompany transferred retail assets in the 2Q'12 and 2Q'11 periods, respectively.
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Asset Management
pretax operating earnings declined 11 percent from a year ago to $130 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline in assets under management, partially offset by continued expense controls.
 
Operating net revenues declined 6 percent to $707 million, primarily driven by the year-over-year impact of lower average assets due to net outflows and market depreciation.
 
Operating expenses improved by 5 percent to $577 million. Expenses remained well controlled and reflected the company's focus on re-engineering to fund investments in the business.
 
Adjusted net pretax operating margin was 33.7 percent for the second quarter of 2012, compared to 34.9 percent a year ago and 33.3 percent sequentially.
 
Total segment assets under management declined 5 percent from a year ago to $446 billion, reflecting net outflows and weighted-equity market depreciation.
 
The Asset Management segment experienced net outflows of $6.6 billion in the quarter, largely driven by $5.9 billion of outflows, which included: $5.2 billion of previously announced net outflows in former parent-company portfolios and New York 529 program assets at Columbia, as well as $0.7 billion of outflows from a closed block of insurance assets at Threadneedle. In addition, Columbia continued to experience net outflows from a third-party subadvisor and in a portfolio where there was a manager retirement, as discussed last quarter.
 
Underlying flow trends at Columbia have improved despite the challenging markets. The company is making good progress distributing through intermediary channels and is in net inflows in its Focus Funds. In the institutional channel, Columbia continues to grow its third-party business, has a strong new business pipeline, and asset retention and win rates remain strong. At Threadneedle, market volatility and weak investor sentiment in Europe resulted in a slowdown in the funding of institutional mandates.
 
 
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Annuities
pretax operating earnings declined 25 percent to $116 million. Variable annuity operating earnings were $83 million, compared to $88 million a year ago. Variable annuity earnings in the quarter included an $11 million unfavorable impact from the market impact on DAC and DSIC, compared to a net benefit of $3 million from these items a year ago. In addition, increased living benefit rider fees and lower distribution expenses from lower sales were offset by the impact of lower interest rates as well as a portion of the guaranty fund assessments. Fixed annuity operating earnings declined by half to $33 million, reflecting a $17 million unfavorable impact from the continued low interest rate environment, as well as $14 million of valuation model adjustments and a portion of the guaranty fund assessments.
 
RiverSource variable annuity account balances were unchanged compared to a year ago at $65 billion. Variable annuity net outflows in the quarter reflected the closed book of annuities sold through third parties and $94 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. Slower sales in the quarter reflected the impact of the introduction of a new variable annuity rider in May and the suspension or restriction of certain product offerings during the quarter. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 1 percent to $14 billion due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given current interest rates.

Represents above normal expected level of claims experience. On a gross basis, catastrophe losses were $17 million and $15 million for 2Q 2012 and 2Q 2011, respectively.
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Protection
pretax operating earnings increased 18 percent to $109 million driven by favorable claims in life and disability income insurance, an improved auto and home combined ratio and a $9 million benefit from a life insurance reserve release. These benefits were partially offset by lower long term care earnings and a modest decline in life insurance in force.
 
Operating net revenues increased 1 percent to $528 million as auto and home premium growth was largely offset by a decline in life and health revenues resulting from a modest decline in life insurance in force.
 
Operating expenses declined 3 percent to $419 million, primarily driven by lower life and disability income insurance claims and the release of a life insurance reserve. Catastrophe losses in Auto and Home were elevated in both the current and prior-year quarterslosses were $8 million more than expected during the current quarter and $11 million more a year ago.
 
Life insurance in force declined 1 percent to $191 billion, and Auto & Home continued its steady growth in policies, up 7 percent compared to a year ago.
 
 
NM  Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Corporate & Other
pretax operating loss was $67 million for the quarter compared to $41 million a year ago, primarily reflecting a $27 million pretax gain on an interest rate hedge in anticipation of issuing debt. Ultimately, the company did not issue debt.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and the related deferred sales inducement costs ("DSIC") and deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") amortization; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations and the impact of consolidating consolidated investment entities ("CIEs"), best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. The Company also uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. However, these measures are not a substitute for GAAP. Therefore, reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" on pages 44 and 45.
 
The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated economic hedge values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("ASC 820"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life Insurance Company's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance.  Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision.  Management believes the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis.
 
In addition, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.  In the Asset Management segment, operating revenues are adjusted to exclude distribution pass through revenues and subadvisory and other pass through revenues, and operating earnings are adjusted to exclude operating net investment income and amortization of intangibles.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
 
Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.  In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched.  No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients. Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (Columbia) predominantly provides U.S. domestic products and services and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Srl (Threadneedle) predominantly provides international investment products and services. Columbia retail products are distributed through our Advice & Wealth Management segment and also through unaffiliated third party financial institutions, including distribution through Bank of America and its affiliates. Institutional products and services are primarily sold through our institutional sales force. Threadneedle retail products are primarily distributed through third parties.

Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.
