Item 2.02      Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On October 24, 2012, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2012.  A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference and furnished herewith. In addition, the Company furnishes herewith, as Exhibit 99.2, its Statistical Supplement for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2012.
 
We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The press release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and the financial information furnished as Exhibit 99.2 include information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Certain non-GAAP performance measures in these exhibits exclude the impact of consolidating certain investment entities ("CIEs"), as well as certain integration/restructuring charges, market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, realized gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures better reflects the underlying performance of our 2012 and 2011 core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 also contain certain non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, along with financial ratios incorporating such measures, that exclude amounts related to one or more of the following: accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI"), fair value of hedges, unamortized discount, the net of assets and liabilities held for sale and the impact of consolidating the assets of certain CIEs.  Management believes that these non-GAAP debt, capital and shareholders' equity measures, and the corresponding ratios, better represent our capital structure. Management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters.
 
Our non-GAAP financial measures included in Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, which our management views as important indicators of financial performance, include the following: adjusted net pretax operating margin; adjusted operating earnings; adjusted operating revenues; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding AOCI; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs; Ameriprise Financial shareholders' equity from continuing operations excluding CIEs and AOCI; basic operating earnings per share; effective tax rate excluding noncontrolling interests; operating earnings; operating earnings per diluted share; operating effective tax rate; operating expenses; operating general and administrative expense; operating return on equity excluding AOCI; operating total net revenues; pretax operating earnings; pretax operating margin; return on equity excluding AOCI; total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs; total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt excluding fair value of hedges and unamortized discount; and total Ameriprise Financial long-term debt to total Ameriprise Financial capital from continuing operations excluding fair value of hedges, unamortized discount and equity of CIEs.

News Release
MINNEAPOLIS  October 24, 2012  Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE: AMP) today reported third quarter 2012 net income from continuing operations attributable to Ameriprise Financial of $174 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to $322 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, a year ago. Third quarter 2012 operating earnings were $289 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, compared to $289 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
Third quarter 2012 operating results included a previously announced $48 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, unfavorable impact from the company's annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and modeling changes (unlocking). This non-cash expense in the quarter compared to an unfavorable impact of $9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, a year ago.
 
Third quarter 2012 operating net revenues of $2.5 billion were unchanged from a year ago and included lower revenues from the impact of unlocking. Net revenues in the year ago quarter included additional investment income recognition. Adjusting for these two items, third quarter 2012 operating net revenues grew 3 percent driven by strong Ameriprise advisor client net inflows and market appreciation, partially offset by a decline in net investment income reflecting continued low short-term interest rates as well as outflows in asset management.
 
Third quarter 2012 operating expenses were unchanged at $2.1 billion, as higher distribution-related expenses offset lower deferred acquisition costs (DAC) amortization. Operating general and administrative expenses were essentially flat compared to a year ago as ongoing expense controls offset investments.
 
The company maintains a strong financial foundation and continues to generate free cash flow. During the quarter, the company returned $416 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and has $482 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. In addition, the Ameriprise Financial Board of Directors declared a $0.45 per common share quarterly cash dividend, a 29 percent increase, or $0.10 per share, and also authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program through 2014.
 
Return on shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) was 10.7 percent for the 12 months ended September 30, 2012. Operating return on equity excluding AOCI was 15.4 percent for the same time period.
 
"We had another good quarter, led by solid results in our advisory and asset management businesses," said Jim Cracchiolo, chairman and chief executive officer. "While equity markets improved in the quarter, low interest rates continue to create headwinds."
 
"Our advisory client base grew nicely in the quarter. We experienced strong retail client net inflows, including more than doubling net inflows into wrap accounts. In Asset Management, we're generating good financial performance, and we're seeing improvement in retail flows. And our annuity and protection businesses continue to generate good returns and remain well positioned.
 
"The company continues to generate strong returns and good cash flow giving us the ability to return significant capital to shareholders. Today, we declared another increase in our quarterly dividend, up 29 percent.  It's our fifth increase since early 2010, bringing our dividend yield to approximately 3 percent. We also authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program as we accelerated our buybacks over the past two years."
 
Third Quarter 2012 Summary
 
In the third quarter of the year, the company conducts an annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations. To the extent that expectations change as a result of this review, the company updates valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of annual unlocking.  As previously announced, the unlocking impact in the quarter primarily reflected the low interest rate environment and the assumption of continued low interest rates over the near term.

 After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 35%.
 
NM Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
The company believes the presentation of operating earnings best represents the economics of the business. Operating earnings, after-tax, exclude the consolidation of certain investment entities; net realized gains or losses; integration and restructuring charges; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits net of hedges and related DAC and deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC) amortization; and income or loss from discontinued operations.
 
Taxes
 
The third quarter 2012 operating effective tax rate was 27.2 percent compared to 23.9 percent a year ago. The third quarter 2012 tax rate was affected by investment losses associated with the Ameriprise Bank transition the company will realize related investment gains in the fourth quarter that will offset these losses. The company expects its full year 2012 operating effective tax rate will be slightly below its previously disclosed 28 to 30 percent range.
 
Third Quarter 2012 Business Highlights

Ameriprise advisor client assets grew 18 percent from a year ago to $345 billion driven by market appreciation and strong net inflows.
 
                 
Wrap assets grew 24 percent to $121 billion, as wrap net inflows in the quarter more than doubled to $2.1 billion compared to the prior year.
 
                 
The company continued to recruit experienced advisors to Ameriprise, adding 106 advisors in the quarter and 314 year to date.

Heardable Score, which measures online brand performance, ranked Ameriprise third among full service investment brands online.
 
                 
Asset Management net outflows of $3.5 billion in the quarter were driven by net outflows in institutional and alternative portfolios. Retail net flows were slightly positive, as strong net inflows at Threadneedle were offset by net outflows at Columbia, including outflows from a third-party subadvisor and the Value and Restructuring fund. In institutional, net outflows of $2.0 billion were driven by Threadneedle outflows of $1.1 billion of legacy insurance assets and $0.9 billion from the previously announced retender of low margin pension assets, which more than offset improved results at Columbia. Alternative net outflows of $1.6 billion were primarily driven by hedge funds.
 
                 
On a global basis, the company had 116 four- and five-star Morningstar-rated funds, including 53 Columbia Management funds and 63 Threadneedle funds.

Segment Summaries
 
 
 
 
NM Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Advice & Wealth Management
pretax operating earnings were $119 million. Pretax operating earnings grew 8 percent after adjusting for $6 million of additional investment income recognition in the year ago quarter. Results in the third quarter reflected revenue growth, continued expense management and ongoing investments in the business, including a new brokerage platform. Third quarter 2012 pretax operating margin remained strong at 12.4 percent.
 
Operating net revenues increased 2 percent to $961 million, or 3 percent after adjusting for the investment income item in the year ago quarter.

Total retail client assets grew 18 percent to $345 billion, reflecting market appreciation and continued strong client net inflows.
 
Operating expenses increased 2 percent to $842 million, primarily reflecting higher distribution expenses associated with strong growth in client assets. General and administrative expenses declined 2 percent, demonstrating on-going expense discipline, which more than offset investments for business growth.

NM Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Asset Management
pretax operating earnings were $155 million, up 30 percent from a year ago, driven by equity market appreciation, $7 million of redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees and continued expense management. Earnings growth was partially offset by the impact of net outflows and a shift in flows from equity to fixed income. Third quarter 2012 adjusted net pretax operating margin was 37.6 percent compared to 32.7 percent a year ago.
 
Operating net revenues increased 4 percent to $733 million, primarily driven by growth in assets from market appreciation and redemption-driven hedge fund performance fees, partially offset by net outflows and the shift in flows from equity to fixed income.
 
Operating expenses improved by 1 percent to $578 million. General and administrative expenses declined $7 million from a year ago reflecting the company's focus on re-engineering to fund investments in the business and included higher compensation-related expenses associated with hedge fund performance fees. The year ago quarter included $10 million of project implementation costs at Threadneedle.
 
Total segment assets under management increased 11 percent from a year ago to $461 billion, reflecting market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows.
 
Asset Management net outflows of $3.5 billion in the quarter were driven by net outflows in institutional and alternative portfolios. Retail net flows were slightly positive, as strong net inflows at Threadneedle were offset by net outflows at Columbia, including outflows from a third-party subadvisor and the Value and Restructuring fund.  In institutional, net outflows of $2.0 billion were driven by Threadneedle outflows of $1.1 billion of legacy insurance assets and $0.9 billion from the previously announced retender of low margin pension assets, which more than offset improved results at Columbia. Alternative net outflows of $1.6 billion were primarily related to the termination of a hedge fund portfolio manager.
 
 
 
NM Not Meaningful  variance of greater than 100%
 
Annuities
pretax operating earnings were $91 million reflecting the impact of unlocking and low interest rates, partially offset by market appreciation.
 
Variable annuity operating earnings were $31 million and included the unfavorable unlocking impact, partially offset by a benefit from the market impact on DAC and DSIC.

Adjusting for these items in both periods, variable annuity earnings increased 15 percent reflecting strong market appreciation.
 
Fixed annuity operating earnings were $60 million and included a favorable unlocking impact. Earnings in the year ago quarter included $31 million of additional investment income recognition. Adjusting for these items in both periods, fixed annuity earnings declined 23 percent, primarily from the continued low interest rate environment.
 
RiverSource variable annuity account balances increased 15 percent to $67.5 billion driven by market appreciation. Variable annuity net outflows in the quarter reflected the closed book of annuities sold through third parties and $58 million of net inflows in the Ameriprise channel. RiverSource fixed annuity account balances declined 1 percent to $14.0 billion due to ongoing net outflows resulting from low client demand given current interest rates.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise Financial" or "the Company") prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Management believes that operating measures, which exclude net realized gains or losses; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges and the related deferred sales inducement costs ("DSIC") and deferred acquisition costs ("DAC") amortization; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations and the impact of consolidating consolidated investment entities ("CIEs"), best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. The Company also uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. However, these measures are not a substitute for GAAP. Therefore, reconciliations to GAAP measures are provided on page 6 and in Exhibit B "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" on pages 44 and 45.
 
The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits includes changes in liability values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in associated economic hedge values.  The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820, ("ASC 820"), including the impact on liability values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of RiverSource Life Insurance Company's nonperformance spread.  Further, the market impact is net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization.  The market impact relates to guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits and non-life contingent guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives. 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 
Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance.  Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income from continuing operations before income tax provision.  Management believes the presentation of segment operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis.
 
In addition, management uses adjusted net pretax operating margin in the Asset Management segment to evaluate segment performance on a basis comparable to other asset managers.  In the Asset Management segment, operating revenues are adjusted to exclude distribution pass through revenues and subadvisory and other pass through revenues, and operating earnings are adjusted to exclude operating net investment income and amortization of intangibles.

Mutual Fund Rankings in top 2 Lipper Quartiles
 
 
Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of Class Z fund shares for Columbia branded mutual funds.  In instances where a fund's Class Z shares do not have a full one, three or five year track record, performance for an older share class of the same fund, typically Class A shares, is utilized for the period before Class Z shares were launched.  No adjustments to the historical track records are made to account for differences in fund expenses between share classes of a fund.
 
Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds.  Asset size is not a factor.
 
Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles:  Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking (using Class Z and appended Class Z) divided by total assets of all funds.  Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.
 
Aggregated data includes all Columbia branded mutual funds.

Advice & Wealth Management
- This segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full service brokerage and banking services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. Ameriprise financial advisors utilize a diversified selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs. A significant portion of revenues in this segment is fee-based, driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on invested assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and earns intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment.
 
Asset Management -
This segment provides investment advice and investment products to retail and institutional clients.

Revenues for our fixed annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on invested assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on invested assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business.

In a non-discretionary wrap account, the client chooses the underlying investments in the portfolio based, to the extent the client elects, in part or whole on the recommendations of their financial advisor. Investors in our wrap accounts generally pay an asset-based fee based on the assets held in their wrap accounts. These investors also pay any related fees or costs included in the underlying securities held in that account, such as underlying mutual fund operating expenses and Rule 12b-1 fees.
