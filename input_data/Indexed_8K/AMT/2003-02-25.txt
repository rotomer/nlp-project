ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On February 24 2003, American Tower Corporation (the "Company") announced an amendment to its senior credit facilities. The Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement entered into by and among American Towers, Inc., certain other borrower subsidiaries of the Company and the lenders named therein ("the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement") provides for the following principal amendments: .. PREPAYMENT OF A PORTION OF OUTSTANDING TERM LOANS. The Company agreed to prepay an aggregate of $200.0 million of the term loans outstanding under the credit facilities from a portion of the net proceeds of the Company's Units offering in January 2003 (the "Units Offering"). This prepayment consists of a $125.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan A and a $75.0 million prepayment of the Term Loan B, each to be applied to reduce scheduled principal payments as described in the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Giving effect to such amendment, as of December 31, 2002, the outstanding debt under the credit facilities was an aggregate of $1.31 billion, consisting of $1.15 billion outstanding under the terms loans and $160.0 million outstanding under the revolving loan. .. REDUCTION TO REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS. The Company also agreed to reduce the revolving loan commitments by $225.0 million for total commitments of $425.0 million. Based on the financial covenants of the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, as of December 31, 2002, the Company had the ability to draw the entire undrawn portion of the $425.0 million revolving loan commitment. The undrawn and available portion amounts to $246.0 million, which is the $425.0 million total less $160 million outstanding on the revolving loan less $19 million in outstanding undrawn letters of credit as of December 31, 2002. .. CONSENT FOR RESTRICTED PAYMENTS TO PREPAY OR REPURCHASE THE 2.25% CONVERTIBLE NOTES. The lenders agreed to permit the Company to make restricted payments of up to $217.0 million, consisting of the balance of the net proceeds of the Units Offering and cash on hand, to prepay or repurchase the Company's 2.25% convertible notes. To the extent that any of those proceeds are not used or required to prepay or repurchase any of the 2.25% convertible notes, the Company may use any remaining proceeds through June 30, 2004 to make restricted payments to prepay or repurchase any indebtedness of the Company. Pending these restricted payments, the $217.0 million will be held in a segregated account that is pledged to the lenders and, to the extent the Company does not use the funds in the account for restricted payments by June 30, 2004, the Company must use the remaining funds to prepay a portion of the term loans outstanding under the credit facilities. .. LEVERAGE RATIO. The leverage ratio was amended to take into account the issuance of the senior subordinated discount notes as part of the Units Offering and a new senior leverage ratio has been added. .. REVOLVER DRAWDOWNS. A provision limiting future revolver drawdowns based on cash on hand of the borrowers has been added. The primary condition for the release to the Company of the net proceeds of the Units Offering, which have been -1-
maintained in an escrow account since January 29, 2003, has now been satisfied as a result of entering into the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement and such release is expected to occur later this month upon consummation of the merger of American Tower Escrow Corporation, the issuer of the senior subordinated discount notes, into American Towers, Inc. The foregoing is only a summary of the principal provisions of the Second Amendment and Restated Loan Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual text of the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement which is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. ------------ Item 7(c).

Upon such Payment Date such LIBOR Advance will, subject to the provisions hereof, be so Continued, Converted or repaid, as applicable. (d) Notification of Lenders. Upon receipt of irrevocable prior telephonic notice in accordance with Section 2.2(b) or (c) hereof or a Request for Advance, or a notice of Conversion or Continuation from a Borrower with respect to any outstanding Advance prior to the Payment Date for such Advance, the Administrative Agent shall promptly but no later than the close of business on the day of such notice notify each Lender having the applicable Commitment by telephone, followed promptly by written notice or telecopy, of the contents thereof and the amount of such Lender's portion of the Advance.

If and to the extent an applicable Lender does not make such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the requesting Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. (iii) If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's portion of the applicable Advance for purposes of this Agreement. If such Lender does not repay such corresponding amount immediately upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers, and the Borrowers shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent, with interest at the Federal Funds Rate. The failure of any Lender to fund its portion of any Advance shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to fund its respective portion of the Advance on the date of such borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for any such failure of any other Lender.

The Notes shall be issued on a joint and several basis by the Borrowers to the Lenders and shall be duly executed and delivered by one or more Authorized Signatories. Any Lender (i) which is not a U.S. Person (a "Non-U.S. Bank") and (ii) which could become completely exempt from withholding of United States federal income taxes in respect of payment of any obligations due to such Lender hereunder relating to any of its Loans if such Loans were in registered form for United States federal income tax purposes may request the Borrowers (through the Administrative Agent), and the Borrowers agree thereupon, to register such Loans as provided in Section 11.5(g) hereof and to issue to such Lender Notes evidencing such Loans as Registered Notes or to exchange Notes evidencing such Loans for new Registered Notes, as applicable. Registered Notes may not be exchanged for Notes that are not in registered form. (b) Each Lender may open and maintain on its books in the name of the Borrowers a loan account with respect to its portion of the Loans and interest thereon. Each Lender which opens such a loan account shall debit such loan account for the principal amount of its portion of each Advance made by it and accrued interest thereon, and shall credit such loan account for each payment on account of principal of or interest on its Loans. The records of a Lender with respect to the loan account maintained by it shall be prima facie evidence of its portion of the Loans and accrued interest thereon absent manifest error, but the failure of any -41-
Lender to make any such notations or any error or mistake in such notations shall not affect the Borrowers' repayment obligations with respect to such Loans. Section 2.9 Manner of Payment. (a) Each payment (including, without limitation, any prepayment) by the Borrowers on account of the principal of or interest on the Loans, commitment fees and any other amount owed to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent or any of them under this Agreement or the Notes shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time) on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Office, for the account of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available funds. Any payment received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time) shall be deemed received on the next Business Day. Receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment intended for any Lender or Lenders hereunder prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time) on any Business Day shall be deemed to constitute receipt by such Lender or Lenders on such Business Day. In the case of a payment for the account of a Lender, the Administrative Agent will promptly, but no later than the close of business on the date such payment is deemed received, thereafter distribute the amount so received in like funds to such Lender. If the Administrative Agent shall not have received any payment from the Borrowers as and when due, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the applicable Lenders accordingly. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall fail to make distribution to any Lender as required under this Section 2.9, the Administrative Agent agrees to pay such Lender interest from the date such payment was due until paid at the Federal Funds Rate. (b) The Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, principal, interest, fees and all other amounts due hereunder or under the Notes without set-off or counterclaim or any deduction whatsoever. (c) Prior to the acceleration of the Loans under Section 8.2 hereof, if some but less than all amounts due from the Borrowers are received by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such amounts in the following order of priority, all on a pro rata basis to the Lenders: (i) to the payment on a pro rata basis of any fees or expenses then due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, or any of them or expenses then due and payable to the Lenders; (ii) to the payment of interest then due and payable on the Loans on a pro rata basis and of fees then due and payable to the Lenders on a pro rata basis; (iii) to the payment of all other amounts not otherwise referred to in this Section 2.9(c) then due and payable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, or any of them, hereunder or under the Notes or any other Loan Document; and (iv) to the payment of principal then due and payable on the Loans on a pro rata basis. (d) Subject to any contrary provisions in the definition of Interest Period, if any payment under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is specified to be made on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next Business Day, and such -42-
extension of time shall in such case be included in computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment. (e) Each Registered Noteholder (or, if such Registered Noteholder is not the beneficial owner thereof, such beneficial owner) shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) prior to or at the time it becomes a Registered Noteholder, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or such successor and related forms as may from time to time be adopted by the relevant taxing authorities of the United States of America), together with an annual certificate stating that such Registered Noteholder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and is not otherwise described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Code. Each Registered Noteholder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) if at any time, such Registered Noteholder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, determines that it is no longer in a position to make the certification made in such certificate to the Borrowers (or any other form of certification adopted by the relevant taxing authorities of the United States of America for such purposes). Section 2.10 Reimbursement. (a) Whenever any Lender shall sustain or incur any losses or reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with (i) the failure by a Borrower to borrow, Continue or Convert any LIBOR Advance after having given notice of its intention to borrow, Continue or Convert such Advance in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof (whether by reason of such Borrower's election not to proceed or the non-fulfillment of any of the conditions set forth in Article 3 hereof), or (ii) the prepayment (or failure to prepay after giving notice thereof) of any LIBOR Advance in whole or in part for any reason, the Borrowers agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, to such Lender, upon such Lender's demand, an amount sufficient to compensate such Lender for all such losses and out-of-pocket expenses. Such Lender's good faith determination of the amount of such losses or out-of-pocket expenses, as set forth in writing and accompanied by calculations in reasonable detail demonstrating the basis for its demand, shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. (b) Losses subject to reimbursement hereunder shall include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, lost margins, expenses incurred by any Lender or any participant of such Lender permitted hereunder in connection with the re-employment of funds prepaid, paid, repaid, not borrowed, or not paid, as the case may be, and will be payable whether the applicable Maturity Date is changed by virtue of an amendment hereto (unless such amendment expressly waives such payment) or as a result of acceleration of the Loans. Section 2.11 Pro Rata Treatment. (a) Advances. Each Advance under the Revolving Loan Commitments from the Lenders hereunder shall be made pro rata on the basis of the applicable Commitment Ratios of the Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment. -43-
(b) Payments. Each payment and prepayment of principal of the Loans, and, except as provided in Section 2.2(e) hereof and Article 10 hereof, each payment of interest on the Loans, shall be made to the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their respective unpaid principal amounts outstanding under the applicable Loans immediately prior to such payment or prepayment. If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Loans in excess of its ratable share of the Loans under its applicable Commitment Ratio, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the portion of the applicable Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and each such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery. The Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.11(b) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including, without limitation, the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such purchasing Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation. (c) Commitment Reductions. Any reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments required or permitted hereunder shall reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender having such a commitment on a pro rata basis based on the Commitment Ratio of such Lender for such commitment. Section 2.12 Capital Adequacy. If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law regarding the capital adequacy of banks or bank holding companies, or any change in Applicable Law (whether adopted before or after the Agreement Date) or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender (or the bank holding company of such Lender) with any directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans and the Commitments to a level below that which it could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy immediately before such adoption, change or compliance and assuming that such Lender's (or the bank holding company of such Lender) capital was fully utilized prior to such adoption, change or compliance) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by such Lender, the Borrowers shall promptly pay, on a joint and several basis, to such Lender such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender (on an after-tax basis) for such reduced return, together with interest on such amount from the fourth (4th) Business Day after the date of demand or the applicable Maturity Date, as applicable, until payment in full thereof at the Default Rate.

To the extent permitted by applicable U.S. Federal law, each such Lender agrees to provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers with new forms prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form, or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms delivered by it to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers. Section 2.14 Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Bank, on behalf of the Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment, and in reliance on the agreements of such Lenders set forth in Section 2.14(d) hereof, hereby agrees to issue one or more Letters of Credit up to an aggregate face amount equal to the Available Letter of Credit Commitment determined immediately prior to giving effect to the issuance thereof; provided, however, that the Issuing Bank shall not issue any Letter of Credit (i) unless the conditions precedent to the issuance thereof set forth in Section 3.3 hereof have been satisfied, (ii) if any Default then exists or would be caused thereby, (iii) if, after giving effect to such issuance, the Available Revolving Loan Commitment would be less than zero or (iv) within thirty (30) days preceding the Maturity Date; and provided further, however, that at no time shall the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Obligations outstanding hereunder exceed $50,000,000.00. Each Letter of Credit shall (A) be payable at sight, (B) be denominated in United States dollars, (C) expire, (i) with respect to -45-
Standby Letters of Credit, no later than the earlier to occur of (x) the fifth Business Day preceding the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and (y) 360 days after its date of issuance (but may contain provisions for automatic renewal provided that no Default or Event of Default exists on the renewal date or would be caused by such renewal), and (ii) with respect to Commercial Letters of Credit, no later than the earlier to occur of (x) the thirtieth day preceding the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and (y) 180 days after its date of Issuance (but may contain provisions for automatic renewal provided that no Default or Event of Default exists on the renewal date or would be caused by such renewal). Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 and, to the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York. The Issuing Bank shall not at any time be obligated to issue, or cause to be issued, any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Bank to exceed any limits imposed by, any Applicable Law. If a Letter of Credit provides that it is automatically renewable unless notice is given by the Issuing Bank that it will not be renewed, the Issuing Bank shall not be bound to give a notice of non-renewal unless directed to do so by Lenders having in the aggregate at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the Revolving Loan Commitment at least sixty-five (65) days prior to the then scheduled expiration date of such Letter of Credit. (b) Any Borrower may from time to time request the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit. The Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank a Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit for each Letter of Credit to be issued by the Issuing Bank not later than 12:00 noon (New York, New York time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the date on which the requested Letter of Credit requested is to be issued, or such shorter notice as may be acceptable to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of any such Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit, subject to satisfaction of all conditions precedent thereto as set forth in Section 3.3 hereof, the Issuing Bank shall process such Request for Issuance of Letter of Credit and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby. The Issuing Bank shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit (or any amendment thereto or renewal or extension thereof) to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders following the issuance thereof. The Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Bank for normal and customary costs and expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in issuing, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering the Letters of Credit. (c) At such time as the Administrative Agent shall be notified by the Issuing Bank that the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit has drawn on the same, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment, by telephonic notice, followed promptly by written notice, of the amount of the draw and, in the case of each such Lender, such Lender's portion of such draw amount as calculated in accordance with its respective Commitment Ratio under the Revolving Loan Commitment. -46-
(d) The Borrowers hereby agree to immediately reimburse the Issuing Bank for amounts paid by the Issuing Bank in respect of draws under a Letter of Credit issued at a Borrower's request. In order to facilitate such repayment, the Borrowers hereby irrevocably request the Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment, and such Lenders hereby severally agree, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement (other than as provided in Article 2 hereof with respect to the amounts of, the timing of requests for, and the repayment of Advances hereunder and in Article 3 hereof with respect to conditions precedent to Advances hereunder), with respect to any honoring of any draw under a Letter of Credit prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 8.1(f) or (g) hereof, to make an Advance (which Advance may be a LIBOR Advance if the Borrowers so request in a timely manner or may be Converted to a LIBOR Advance as provided in the Loan Agreement) to the Borrowers on each day on which the Issuing Bank honors a draw is made under any Letter of Credit and in the amount of such draw, and to pay the proceeds of such Advance directly to the Issuing Bank to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount paid by it upon such draw. Each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall pay its share of such Advance by paying its portion of such Advance to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof and its respective Commitment Ratio under the Revolving Loan Commitments, without reduction for any set-off or counterclaim of any nature whatsoever and regardless of whether any Default or Event of Default (other than with respect to an Event of Default under Section 8.1(f) or (g) hereof) then exists or would be caused thereby. If at any time that any Letters of Credit are outstanding, any of the events described in clauses of Section 8.1(f) or (g) hereof shall have occurred and be continuing, then each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall, automatically upon the occurrence of any such event and without any action on the part of the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent or such Lenders, be deemed to have purchased an undivided participation in the face amount of all Letters of Credit then outstanding in an amount equal to such Lender's respective Commitment Ratio under the Revolving Loan Commitments, and each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall, notwithstanding such Event of Default, upon a drawing being honored under any Letter of Credit, immediately pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds, the amount of such Lender's participation (and the Issuing Bank shall deliver to such Lender a loan participation certificate dated the date of the occurrence of such event and in the amount of such Lender's respective Commitment Ratio under the Revolving Loan Commitments). The disbursement of funds in connection with a draw under a Letter of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.14(d) shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2(e) hereof. The obligation of each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment to make payments to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, in accordance with this Section 2.14 shall be absolute and unconditional and no such Lender shall be relieved of its obligations to make such payments by reason of noncompliance by any other Person with the terms of the Letter of Credit or for any other reason. The Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received from the other Lenders. Any overdue amounts payable by the Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment to the Issuing Bank in respect of a draw under any Letter of Credit shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the rate on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by federal funds brokers, as published for such day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. -47-
(e) The Borrowers agree that any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for such actions or omissions as shall constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank, shall be binding on the Borrowers as between the Borrowers and the Issuing Bank, and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Bank to the Borrowers. The obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the Lenders for Advances made to reimburse the Issuing Bank for draws under the Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances whatsoever, including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or consent to any departure from any or all of the Loan Documents; (iii) any improper use which may be made of any Letter of Credit or any improper acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit in connection therewith; (iv) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or any right which the Borrowers may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting) or any Lender (other than the defense of payment to such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) or any other Person, whether in connection with any Letter of Credit, any transaction contemplated by any Letter of Credit, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any unrelated transaction; (v) any statement or any other documents presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be insufficient, forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect whatsoever, provided that the same shall not have resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (vi) the insolvency of any Person issuing any documents in connection with any Letter of Credit; (vii) any breach of any agreement between the Borrowers and any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit, provided that the same shall not have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (viii) any irregularity in the transaction with respect to which any Letter of Credit is issued, including any fraud by the beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter -48-
of Credit, provided that the same shall not have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (ix) any errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, wireless or otherwise, whether or not they are in code, provided that the same shall not have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (x) any act, error, neglect or default, omission, insolvency or failure of business of any of the correspondents of the Issuing Bank, provided that the same shall not have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; (xi) any other circumstances arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; (xii) payment by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a sight draft or a certificate which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, provided that the same shall not have resulted from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank; and (xiii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, provided that the same shall not have resulted from the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender. (f) If any change in Applicable Law, any change in the interpretation or administration thereof, or any change in compliance with Applicable Law by the Issuing Bank or any Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment as a result of any official request or directive of any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency (whether or not having the force of law) shall (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit, capital adequacy, assessment or other requirements or conditions against Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank or against participations by any other Lender in the Letters of Credit or (ii) impose on the Issuing Bank or any other Lender any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit or any participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing in the reasonable determination of the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, is to increase the cost to the Issuing Bank or such Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining any participation therein, as the case may be, by an amount (which amount shall be reasonably determined) deemed by the Issuing Bank or such Lender to be material, and the designation of a different lending office will not avoid the need for additional compensation (without creating other unreimbursed costs or disadvantage to such Lender), then, on request by the Issuing Bank or such Lender, the Borrower shall pay, within ten (10) days after demand, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as the Issuing Bank or such Lender, as the case may be, so determines will compensate it on an after-tax basis for such increased costs. A certificate of the Issuing Bank or such Lender -49-
setting forth the amount, and in reasonable detail the basis for the Issuing Bank or such Lender's determination of such amount, to be paid to the Issuing Bank or such Lender by the Borrower as a result of any event referred to in this paragraph shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive. (g) Each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall be responsible for its pro rata share (based on such Lender's respective Commitment Ratio under the Revolving Loan Commitments) of any and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses (including reasonable legal fees) and disbursements which may be incurred or made by the Issuing Bank in connection with the collection of any amounts due under, the administration of, or the presentation or enforcement of any rights conferred by any Letter of Credit, the Borrowers' or any guarantor's obligations to reimburse or otherwise. In the event the Borrowers shall fail to pay such expenses of the Issuing Bank within ten (10) days after demand for payment by the Issuing Bank, each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment shall thereupon pay to the Issuing Bank its pro rata share (based on such Lender's respective Commitment Ratio under the Revolving Loan Commitments) of such expenses within five (5) days from the date of the Issuing Bank's notice to the Lenders having a Revolving Loan Commitment of the Borrowers' failure to pay; provided, however, that if the Borrowers or any guarantor shall thereafter pay such expense, the Issuing Bank will repay to each Lender having a Revolving Loan Commitment the amounts received from such Lender hereunder. (h) The Borrowers agree that each Advance by the Lenders having Revolving Loan Commitments to reimburse the Issuing Bank for draws under any Letter of Credit, shall, for all purposes hereunder, be deemed to be an Advance under the Revolving Loan Commitment to the Borrowers and shall be payable and bear interest in accordance with all other Revolving Loans to the Borrowers. (i) The Borrowers will indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender and each of the foregoing Person's respective employees, representatives, officers and directors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses (other than loss of profits), damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees, but excluding taxes) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such other Lender in any way relating to or arising out of the issuance of a Letter of Credit, except that the Borrowers shall not be liable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any such Lender for any portion of such claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses, or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person seeking indemnification as determined by a non-appealable judicial order.

None of the Borrowers nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries has any material liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than as disclosed in the financial statements referred to in the preceding sentence or as set forth or referred to in this Agreement. (l) No Material Adverse Change. There has occurred no event since December 31, 2001 which has or which could reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect. (m) ERISA. Each Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary and each of their respective Plans are in compliance with ERISA and the Code, except to the extent that the failure to so comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect, and none of the Borrowers nor any of their ERISA Affiliates, including their Subsidiaries, has incurred any accumulated funding deficiency with respect to any such Plan within the meaning of ERISA or the Code. The Borrowers, each of their Restricted Subsidiaries, and each other ERISA Affiliate have complied in all material respects with all requirements of ERISA. No Borrower nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries has made any promises of retirement or other benefits to employees, except as set forth in the Plans, in written agreements with such employees, or in such Person's employee handbook and memoranda to employees. No Borrower nor any of its ERISA Affiliates, including their Subsidiaries, has incurred any material liability to PBGC in connection with any such Plan. The assets of each such Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA are sufficient to provide the benefits under such Plan, the payment of which PBGC would guarantee if such Plan were terminated, and such assets are also sufficient to provide all other "benefit liabilities" (within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA) due under the Plan upon termination. No Reportable Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to any such Plan. No Plan or trust created thereunder, or party in interest (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA), or any fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA), has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) which would subject such Plan or any other Plan of any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary, any trust created thereunder, or any such party in interest or fiduciary, or any party dealing with any such Plan or any such trust, to any material tax or penalty on "prohibited transactions" imposed by Section 502 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. No Borrower nor any of its ERISA Affiliates, including their Subsidiaries, is or has been obligated to make any payment to a Multiemployer Plan. (n) Compliance with Regulations U and X. No Borrower nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is engaged principally or as one of its important activities in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying, and no Borrower nor any -57-
Restricted Subsidiary owns or presently intends to acquire, any "margin stock" as defined in Regulations U and X (12 C.F.R. Parts 221 and 224) (the "Regulations") of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("margin stock"). None of the proceeds of the Loans will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any Indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a "purpose credit" within the meaning of the Regulations. No Borrower has taken, caused or authorized to be taken, and will not take any action which might cause this Agreement or the Notes to violate any of the Regulations or any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as now in effect or as the same may hereafter be in effect. If so requested by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers will furnish the Administrative Agent with (i) a statement or statements in conformity with the requirements of Federal Reserve Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and (ii) other documents evidencing its compliance with the margin regulations, reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent. Neither the making of the Loans nor the use of proceeds thereof will violate, or be inconsistent with, the provisions of any of the Regulations. (o) Investment Company Act. No Borrower nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is required to register under the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and neither the entering into or performance by the Borrowers and the Restricted Subsidiaries of this Agreement and the Loan Documents nor the issuance of the Notes violates any provision of such Act or requires any consent, approval or authorization of, or registration with, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental or public body or authority pursuant to any provisions of such Act. (p) Governmental Regulation. No Borrower nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is required to obtain any consent, approval, authorization, permit or license which has not already been obtained from, or effect any filing or registration which has not already been effected with, any federal, state or local regulatory authority in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. No Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary is required to obtain any consent, approval, authorization, permit or license which has not already been obtained from, or effect any filing or registration which has not already been effected with, any federal, state or local regulatory authority in connection with the performance, in accordance with their respective terms, of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, other than filing of appropriate Uniform Commercial Code financing statements. (q) Absence of Default, Etc. The Borrowers and the Restricted Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all of the provisions of their respective partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements, Certificates or Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, as the case may be, and no event has occurred or failed to occur (including, without limitation, any matter which could create a Default hereunder by cross-default) which has not been remedied or waived, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which constitutes, (i) a Default or (ii) a material default by any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary under any indenture, -58-
agreement or other instrument relating to Indebtedness of such Person in the amount of $10,000,000.00 or more in the aggregate, any material License, or any judgment, decree or order to which any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of its respective properties may be bound or affected.

(s) Agreements with Affiliates. Except for agreements or arrangements with Affiliates wherein the Borrowers or one or more of the Restricted Subsidiaries provides services to or receives services from such Affiliates for fair consideration or which are set forth on Schedule 5 attached hereto, no Borrower nor any Restricted Subsidiary has (i) any written agreements or binding arrangements of any kind with any Affiliate or (ii) any management or consulting agreements of any kind with any Affiliate, other than (x) those among the Borrowers, the Restricted Subsidiaries and/or the Parent, and (y) employment arrangements with executive officers, including, without limitation, stock option grants of the Parent. (t) Payment of Wages. Each Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary is in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, in all material respects, and to the Knowledge of the Borrowers and each Restricted Subsidiary, such Persons have paid all minimum and overtime wages required by law to be paid to their respective employees except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse Effect.

The Security Interest is a valid and, upon filing of appropriate Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and/or mortgages, will be a perfected first priority security interest in the Collateral in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of itself, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, securing, in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Obligations, and the Collateral is subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens. The Liens created by the Security Documents are enforceable as security for the Obligations in accordance with their terms with respect to the Collateral subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to the following qualifications: (i) an order of specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies and, in particular, may not be available where damages are considered an -59-
adequate remedy at law, and (ii) enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, reconstruction and other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally (insofar as any such law relates to the bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event of any Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be).

Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent, as agent for the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, the true and lawful attorney of each of them, in its name and stead and on its behalf, to execute, receipt for or otherwise act in connection with any and all contracts, instruments or other documents in connection with the completion and operation of the communications tower facilities in the exercise of the Administrative Agent's, the Issuing Bank's and the Lenders' rights under this Section 8.2(d).

(f) The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder shall be cumulative, and not exclusive. (g) In the event that the Administrative Agent establishes a cash collateral account as contemplated by this Section 8.2, the Administrative Agent shall invest all funds in such account in such investments as the Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems appropriate. Each of the Borrowers hereby acknowledges and agrees that any interest earned on such funds shall be retained by the Administrative Agent as additional collateral for -84-
the Obligations. Upon satisfaction in full of all Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall pay any amounts then held in such account to the Borrowers. Section 8.3 Payments Subsequent to Declaration of Event of Default.

ARTICLE 9 The Administrative Agent Section 9.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes, and hereby agrees that it will require any transferee of any of its interest in its portion of the Loans and in its Note to appoint and authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such actions as its agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as are delegated by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Neither the Administrative Agent, nor any of its respective directors, officers, employees or agents, shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or in connection herewith, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Section 9.2 Interest Holders. The Administrative Agent may treat each Lender, or the Person designated in the last notice filed with the Administrative Agent, as the holder of all of the interests of such Lender in its portion of the Loans and in its Note until written notice of transfer, signed by such Lender (or the Person designated in the last notice filed with the Administrative Agent) and by the Person designated in such written notice of transfer, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. -85-
Section 9.3 Consultation with Counsel. The Administrative Agent may consult with Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy LLP, Atlanta, Georgia, special counsel to the Administrative Agent, or with other legal counsel selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in consultation with the Majority Lenders and in reasonable reliance on such consultations. Section 9.4 Documents.

Section 9.5 Administrative Agent and Affiliates. With respect to the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Loans, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender, and the Administrative Agent and Affiliates of the Administrative Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates of, or Persons doing business with, any Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, as if they were not affiliated with the Administrative Agent and without any obligation to account therefor.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing unless it has actual knowledge, or has been notified in writing by any Borrower, of such fact, or has been notified by a Lender in writing that such Lender considers that a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and such Lender shall specify in detail the nature thereof in writing. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank shall not be liable hereunder for any action taken or omitted to be taken except for its own respective gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

rights or to take or refrain from taking such action; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not exercise any rights under Section 8.2(a) hereof without the request of the Majority Lenders (or, where expressly required, all the Lenders), unless time is of the essence, in which case, such action can be taken at the discretion of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement with respect to anything which it may do or refrain from doing in the reasonable exercise of its judgment or which may seem to it to be necessary or desirable in the circumstances, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter. (b) The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank shall not be liable to the Lenders or to any Lender or to any Borrower, any of their Subsidiaries, the Parent or any other obligor under any Loan Document in acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Lenders (or, where expressly required, all of the Lenders), and any action taken or failure to act pursuant to such instructions shall be binding on all of the Lenders, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter. The Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to take any action which is contrary to law or which would in its reasonable opinion subject it to liability. Section 9.8 Notice of Default or Event of Default. In the event that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall acquire actual knowledge, or shall have been notified, of any Default or Event of Default, the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Lenders (provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not result in any liability on the part of such Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent), and the Administrative Agent shall take such action and assert such rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority Lenders shall request in writing, and the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any liability by reason of its acting pursuant to any such request. If the Majority Lenders shall fail to request the Administrative Agent to take action or to assert rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Documents in respect of any Default or Event of Default within ten (10) days after their receipt of the notice of any Default or Event of Default from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, or shall request inconsistent action with respect to such Default or Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, take such action and assert such rights (other than rights under Article 8 hereof) as it deems in its discretion to be advisable for the protection of the Lenders, except that, if the Majority Lenders have instructed the Administrative Agent not to take such action or assert such right, in no event shall the Administrative Agent act contrary to such instructions, unless time is of the essence, in which case, the Administrative Agent may act in accordance with its reasonable discretion. Section 9.9 Responsibility Disclaimed. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any liability or responsibility whatsoever as Administrative Agent: -87-
(a) to any Borrower or any other Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance by, or any breach by, any Lender or Lenders of any of its or their obligations under this Agreement; (b) to any Lender or Lenders as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance by, or any breach by, (i) the Borrowers of any of their obligations under this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document, or (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary or any other obligor under any other Loan Document; (c) to any Lender or Lenders, for any statements, representations or warranties in this Agreement, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement or any information provided pursuant to this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement, or for the validity, effectiveness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, the Notes, any other Loan Document, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement; or (d) to any Person for any act or omission other than that arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent as determined by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers) pro rata according to their respective Commitment Ratios, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses (other than the loss of principal, interest and fees hereunder in the event of a bankruptcy or out-of-court `work-out' of the Loans), damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, or reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of experts, agents, consultants and counsel), or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement, except that no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, or reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent as determined by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter. Section 9.11 Credit Decision. Each Lender confirms that: (a) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to make its portion of the Loans it has independently taken whatever steps it considers necessary to evaluate the financial condition and affairs of the Borrowers and that it has made an independent credit judgment, and that it has not relied upon the Administrative Agent or information provided by -88-
the Administrative Agent (other than information provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers and forwarded by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders); and (b) so long as any portion of the Loans remains outstanding or such Lender has an obligation to make its portion of Advances hereunder, it will continue to make its own independent evaluation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrowers. Section 9.12 Successor Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrowers and may be removed at any time for cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, prior to a Default, be subject to the consent of the Borrowers, acting reasonably. If (a) no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders or (b) if appointed, no successor Administrative Agent shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gave notice of resignation or the Majority Lenders removed the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be any Lender or a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or any political subdivision thereof which has combined capital and reserves in excess of $250,000,000.00 and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges, duties and obligations of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent the provisions of this Article shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent. In the event that the Administrative Agent or any of its respective Affiliates ceases to be a Lender hereunder, such Person shall resign its agency hereunder. Section 9.13 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents or attorneys selected by it using reasonable care, and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Section 9.14 No Responsibilities of the Agents. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents shall not have any duties or responsibilities, nor shall the Co-Syndication Agents or the Co-Documentation Agents have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Co-Syndication Agents and the Co-Documentation Agents. -89-
ARTICLE 10 Changes in Circumstances Affecting LIBOR Advances and Increased Costs Section 10.1 LIBOR Basis Determination Inadequate or Unfair. If with respect to any proposed LIBOR Advance for any Interest Period, the Administrative Agent determines after consultation with the Lenders that deposits in dollars (in the applicable amount) are not being offered to each of the Lenders in the relevant market for such Interest Period or that adequate and fair means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Basis, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such situation no longer exist, the obligations of any affected Lender to make its portion of such LIBOR Advances shall be suspended. Section 10.2 Illegality. If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable Law (whether adopted before or after the Agreement Date), or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund its portion of LIBOR Advances, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrowers. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 10.2, such Lender shall designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Upon receipt of such notice, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 2 hereof, the Borrowers shall repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of such Lender's portion of each affected LIBOR Advance, together with accrued interest thereon, on either (a) the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such affected LIBOR Advances if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund its portion of such LIBOR Advance to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain its portion of such affected LIBOR Advances to such day. Concurrently with repaying such portion of each affected LIBOR Advance, the Borrowers may borrow a Base Rate Advance from such Lender, whether or not it would have been entitled to effect such borrowing, and such Lender shall make such Advance, if so requested, in an amount such that the outstanding principal amount of the affected Note held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding principal amount of such Note immediately prior to such repayment. Section 10.3 Increased Costs. (a) If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable Law (whether adopted before or after the Agreement Date), or any interpretation or change in interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental -90-
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency: (1) shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its obligation to make its portion of LIBOR Advances, or its portion of other Advances, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on its portion of LIBOR Advances or in respect of any other amounts due under this Agreement, or its obligation to make its portion of Advances (except for changes in the rate or method of calculation of tax on the revenues or net income of such Lender); or (2) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, capital adequacy, assessment or other requirement or condition against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or commitments or credit extended by, any Lender or shall impose on any Lender or the London interbank borrowing market any other condition affecting its obligation to make its portion of such LIBOR Advances or its portion of existing Advances; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any of its portion of LIBOR Advances, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, then, within ten (10) days after demand by such Lender, the Borrowers agree to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender on an after-tax basis for such increased costs. All payments made by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall, as set forth above, be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp, or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any governmental authority excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Lender as a result of present or former connection between such Person and the jurisdiction of the governmental authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from such Person having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings (collectively, the "Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to such Person shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Person (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest on any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof if such Person fails to comply with the requirements of Section 2.13 hereof. Whenever any Non- -91-
Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrowers, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrowers shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrowers showing payment thereof. If the Borrowers fail to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other documentary evidence, the Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as result of any such failure. The Borrowers shall make any payments required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of written demand therefor from the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be. The agreements set forth in this Section 10.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations. Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 10.3 and will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender made in good faith, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Borrowers shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrowers are liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required under the Code. (b) Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 10.3 shall provide the Borrowers with a written certificate setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and calculations therefor in reasonable detail. Such certificate shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. If any Lender demands compensation under this Section 10.3, the Borrowers may at any time, upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior notice to such Lender, prepay in full such Lender's portion of the then outstanding LIBOR Advances, together with accrued interest and fees thereon to the date of prepayment, along with any reimbursement required under Section 2.10 hereof and this Section 10.3. Concurrently with prepaying such portion of LIBOR Advances the Borrowers may, whether or not then entitled to make such borrowing, borrow a Base Rate Advance, or a LIBOR Advance not so affected, from such Lender, and such Lender shall, if so requested, make such Advance in an amount such that the outstanding principal amount of the affected Note or Notes held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding principal amount of such Note or Notes immediately prior to such prepayment. Section 10.4 Effect On Other Advances. If notice has been given pursuant to Section 10.1, 10.2 or 10.3 hereof suspending the obligation of any Lender to make its portion of any type of LIBOR Advance, or requiring such Lender's portion of LIBOR Advances to be repaid or prepaid, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such repayment no longer apply, all amounts which would otherwise be made by such Lender as its portion of LIBOR Advances shall be instead as Base Rate Advances, unless otherwise notified by any of the Borrowers. -92-

Section 11.3 Waivers. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, or any of them, in exercising any right, shall operate as a waiver of such right. The Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank expressly reserve the right to require strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement in connection with any future funding of a Request for Advance. In the event the Lenders decide to fund a Request for Advance or the Issuing Bank to issue a Letter of Credit at a time when the Borrowers are not in strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement, such decision by the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, respectively, shall not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the Lenders to fund any further Request for Advance or the Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit or preclude the Lenders, the Administrative Agent from exercising any rights available under the Loan Documents or at law or equity. Any waiver or indulgence granted by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Majority Lenders and the Issuing Bank, or any of them, shall not constitute a modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent expressly provided in such waiver or indulgence, or constitute a course of dealing at variance with the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document such as to require further notice of their intent to require strict adherence to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document in the future. Section 11.4 Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under Applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Administrative Agent, each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank are hereby authorized by the Borrowers at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Borrowers or to any other Person, any such notice being, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, including, without limitation, Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, in each case whether matured or unmatured) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers or any Restricted Subsidiary, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of the Borrowers to the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, including, without limitation, all Obligations and any other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether (a) any Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) any Lender, Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank shall have declared the principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts due hereunder to be due and payable as permitted by Section 8.2 hereof and although such obligations and liabilities or any of them shall be contingent or unmatured. Upon direction by the Administrative Agent, with the consent of all of the Lenders, each Lender or the Issuing Bank holding deposits of any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary shall exercise its set-off rights as so directed; and, within one (1) Business Day following any such set-off, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.4, no Lender nor the Issuing Bank shall exercise any right of set-off without the prior consent of the Majority -95-
Lenders so long as the Obligations shall be secured by any real property or real property interest, it being understood and agreed that the provisions of this sentence are for the exclusive benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, may be amended, modified or waived by the Majority Lenders without notice to or consent of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary and shall not constitute a waiver of any rights against the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or against any Collateral. Section 11.5 Assignment and Participation. (a) No Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder, under the Notes or under any other Loan Document without the prior written consent of each Lender and the Issuing Bank. (b) Each Lender may at any time sell assignments or participations of up to one hundred percent (100%) of its interest hereunder to (A) one (1) or more wholly-owned Affiliates of such Lender or Approved Funds (provided, however, that if such Affiliate is not a financial institution, such Lender shall be obligated to repurchase such assignment if such Affiliate is unable to honor its obligations hereunder), (B) any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank (provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve such Lender from its obligations hereunder) or (C) any Lender. (c) Each Lender may at any time sell assignments or participations to one or more Persons pursuant to which each Lender may assign or participate its interest under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its interest in any particular Advance or portion thereof; provided, however, that (1) all assignments (other than assignments described in Section 11.5(b) hereof) shall be in minimum principal amounts of the lesser of (X) $5,000,000.00 (unless otherwise consented to by the Administrative Agent and, prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Borrower), and (Y) the amount assigned of such Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment (in a single assignment only), and (2) all assignments and participations (other than assignments and participations described in Section 11.5(b) hereof) hereunder shall be subject to the following additional terms and conditions: (i) no assignment shall be sold without the prior consent of the Administrative Agent and, prior to the occurrence and continuation of a Default or Event of Default, the consent of the Borrowers, in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; (ii) any Person purchasing a participation or an assignment of any portion of the Loans from any Lender shall be required to represent and warrant that its purchase shall not constitute a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4.1(m) hereof); -96-
(iii) the Borrowers, the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent agree that assignments permitted hereunder (including the assignment of any Advance or portion thereof) may be made with all voting rights, and shall be made pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit L attached hereto, and an administrative fee of $3,500.00 shall be payable to the Administrative Agent either by the assigning Lender or the assignee thereof at the time of any assignment under this Section 11.5(c); (iv) no participation agreement shall confer any rights under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to any purchaser thereof, or relieve any issuing Lender from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and all actions hereunder shall be conducted as if no such participation had been granted; provided, however, that any participation agreement may confer on the participant the right to approve or disapprove items requiring unanimous Lender consent pursuant to Section 11.12 hereof; (v) each Lender agrees to provide the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers with prompt written notice of any issuance of assignments of its interests hereunder; (vi) no assignment, participation or other transfer of any rights hereunder or under the Notes shall be effected that would result in any interest requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification under any state securities law; (vii) no such assignment may be made to any bank or other financial institution (x) with respect to which a receiver or conservator (including, without limitation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Company or the Office of Thrift Supervision) has been appointed or (y) that is not "adequately capitalized" (as such term is defined in Section 131(b)(1)(B) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act as in effect on the Agreement Date); and (viii) if applicable, each Lender shall, and shall cause each of its assignees to, provide to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the effective date of any assignment an appropriate Internal Revenue Service form as required by Applicable Law supporting such Lender's or assignee's position that no withholding by any Borrower or the Administrative Agent for United States income tax payable by such Lender or assignee in respect of amounts received by it hereunder is required. For purposes of this Agreement, an appropriate Internal Revenue Service form shall mean Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or any successor or related forms adopted by the relevant United States taxing authorities. (d) Except as specifically set forth in Section 11.5(b) or (c) hereof, nothing in this Agreement or the Notes, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer on any Person other than the respective parties hereto and thereto and their successors and assignees permitted -97-
hereunder and thereunder any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or other claim under this Agreement or the Notes. (e) In the case of any participation, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents shall be calculated and made in the manner and to the parties hereto as if no such participation had been sold. (f) The provisions of this Section 11.5 shall not apply to any purchase of participations among the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof. (g) The Administrative Agent, acting, for this purpose only, as agent of the Borrowers shall maintain, at no extra charge to the Borrowers, a register (the "Register") at the address to which notices to the Administrative Agent are to be sent under Section 11.1 hereof on which Register the Administrative Agent shall enter the name, address and taxpayer identification number (if provided) of the registered owner of the Loans evidenced by a Registered Note or, upon the request of the registered owner, for which a Registered Note has been requested. A Registered Note and the Loans evidenced thereby may be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by registration of such assignment or transfer of such Registered Note and the Loans evidenced thereby on the Register. Any assignment or transfer of all or part of such Loans and the Registered Note evidencing the same shall be registered on the Register only upon compliance with the other provisions of this Section 11.5 and surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Registered Note evidencing such Loans, duly endorsed by (or accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or transfer duly executed by) the Registered Noteholder thereof, and thereupon one or more new Registered Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s) and, if less than the aggregate principal amount of such Registered Notes is thereby transferred, the assignor or transferor. Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Registered Note, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall treat the Person in whose name such Loans and the Registered Note evidencing the same is registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. (h) The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender at any reasonable time during the Administrative Agent's regular business hours upon reasonable prior notice. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender that is a fund that invests in bank loans may, without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers, pledge all or any portion of its rights under, and interest in, this Agreement and the Notes to any trustee or to any other representative of holders of obligations owed or securities issued, by such fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided, however, that any transfer to any Person upon the enforcement of such pledge or security interest may only be made subject to the assignment provisions of this Section 11.5. -98-
(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC") sponsored by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Advance and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof. The Loans by an SPC hereunder shall be Revolving Loans, Term Loan A Loans, and/or Term Loan B Loans of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loans were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it, solely in its capacity as a party hereto and to any other Loan Document, will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.5, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Advances to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Advances and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This Section 11.5(j) may not be amended without the written consent of any SPC which has been designated in writing as provided in the first sentence hereof and holds any outstanding Loans. The designation by a Granting Lender of an SPC to fund Advances (i) shall be deemed to be a representation, warranty, covenant and agreement by such Granting Lender to the Borrowers and all other parties hereunder that (A) the funding and maintaining of such Advances by such SPC shall not constitute a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4.1(m) hereof), and (B) such designation, funding and maintenance would not result in any interest requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification under any state securities law, and shall from time to time provide to the Borrowers the tax and other forms required pursuant to Section 2.09(e) hereof with respect to such SPC as though such SPC were a Lender hereunder. In no event shall the Borrowers or any Lender other than the Granting Lender be obligated hereunder to pay any additional amounts under any provision of this Agreement (pursuant to Article 10 hereof or otherwise) by reason of a Granting Lender's designation of an SPC or the funding or maintenance of Advances by such SPC, in excess of amounts which the Borrowers would have been obligated to pay if such Granting Lender had not made such designation and such Granting Lender were itself funding and maintaining such Advances. The Administrative Agent shall register the interest of any SPC in an advance from -99-
time to time on the Register maintained pursuant to Section 11.5(g) hereof. Section 11.6 Accounting Principles. All references in this Agreement to GAAP shall be to such principles as in effect from time to time. All accounting terms used herein without definition shall be used as defined under GAAP. All references to the financial statements of the Borrowers and to their Annualized Operating Cash Flow, Senior Debt, Operating Cash Flow, Total Debt, Fixed Charges, Pro Forma Debt Service, Interest Expense, and other such terms shall be deemed to refer to such items of the Borrowers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, on a fully consolidated basis. The Borrowers shall deliver to the Lenders at the same time as the delivery of any quarterly or annual financial statements required pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2 hereof, as applicable, (a) a description in reasonable detail of any material variation between the application of GAAP employed in the preparation of such statements and the application of GAAP employed in the preparation of the next preceding quarterly or annual financial statements, as applicable, and (b) reasonable estimates of the differences between such statements arising as a consequence thereof. If, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the quarterly or annual financial statements referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the Majority Lenders shall object in writing to the Borrowers' determining compliance hereunder on such basis, (1) calculations for the purposes of determining compliance hereunder shall be made on a basis consistent with those used in the preparation of the latest financial statements as to which such objection shall not have been made, or (2) if requested by the Borrowers, the Majority Lenders will negotiate in good faith to amend the covenants herein to give effect to the changes in GAAP in a manner consistent with this Agreement (and so long as the Borrowers comply in good faith with the provisions of this Section 11.6, no Default or Event of Default shall occur hereunder solely as a result of such changes in GAAP). Section 11.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such separate counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Section 11.8 Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed the State of New York. If any action or proceeding shall be brought by the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document in order to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement or under any Note or any other Loan Document, each of the Borrowers hereby consents and will, and each of the Borrowers will cause each Restricted Subsidiary to, submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting within the area comprising the Southern District of New York on the date of this Agreement. Each of the Borrowers, for itself and on behalf of its Restricted Subsidiaries, hereby agrees that, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, service of the summons and complaint and all other process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding may be effected by mailing by registered mail a copy of such process to the offices of the Borrowers at the address given in Section 11.1 hereof and that personal service of process shall not be required. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit service of process by any other method permitted by law, or the bringing of any suit, action or proceeding in any other -100-
jurisdiction. The Borrowers agree that final judgment in such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Section 11.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof in that jurisdiction or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Section 11.10 Interest. (a) In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable hereunder or under the Notes exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law, and in the event any such payment is inadvertently made by the Borrowers or inadvertently received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, then such excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless, if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, in writing, that it elects to have such excess sum returned forthwith. It is the express intent hereof that the Borrowers not pay and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may legally be paid by the Borrowers under Applicable Law. (b) Notwithstanding the use by the Lenders of the Base Rate and the LIBOR as reference rates for the determination of interest on the Loans, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to obtain funds from any particular source in order to charge interest to the Borrowers at interest rates related to such reference rates. Section 11.11 Table of Contents and Headings. The Table of Contents and the headings of the various subdivisions used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not in any way modify or amend any of the terms or provisions hereof, nor be used in connection with the interpretation of any provision hereof.

Neither this Agreement nor any Loan Document nor any term hereof or thereof may be amended orally, nor may any provision hereof or thereof be waived orally but only by an instrument in writing signed by or at the written direction of the Majority Lenders and, in the case of an amendment, by the Borrowers, except that in the event of (a) any increase in the amount of any Lender's portion of the Commitments or Commitment Ratios or any reduction or postponement of the reductions to the Revolving Loan Commitments set forth in Section 2.5(a) hereof, (b) any reduction (without a corresponding payment) or postponement of the repayments of the principal amount of the Loans provided in Section 2.7(b)(i) hereof, (c) any reduction or postponement in interest or fees due hereunder of the payment thereof without a corresponding payment of such interest or fee amount by the Borrowers, (d) any release of any material portion of the Collateral for the Loans, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.4 hereof, (e) any waiver of any Default due to the failure by the -101-
Borrowers to pay any sum due to any of the Lenders hereunder, (f) any release of any material Guarantor to a Guaranty of all or any portion of the Obligations, except in connection with a merger, sale or other disposition otherwise permitted hereunder (in which case, such release shall require no further approval by the Lenders), (g) any amendment to the pro rata treatment of the Lenders set forth in Section 2.11 hereof, (h) any amendment of this Section 11.12, of the definition of Majority Lenders, or of any Section herein to the extent that such Section requires action by all Lenders or the Issuing Bank, or (i) subordinate the Loans in full to any of the Indebtedness, any amendment or waiver or consent may be made only by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, respectively, and, in the case of an amendment, by the Borrowers. Any amendment to any provision hereunder governing the rights, obligations, or liabilities of the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such, may be made only by an instrument in writing signed by such affected Person and by each of the Lenders. Section 11.13 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents described or contemplated herein or therein will embody the entire agreement and understanding among the parties hereto and thereto and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Section 11.14 Other Relationships. No relationship created hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall in any way affect the ability of the Administrative Agent and each Lender to enter into or maintain business relationships with any Borrower or any Affiliate thereof beyond the relationships specifically contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 11.15 Directly or Indirectly.

EXHIBIT C REVOLVING LOAN PROMISSORY NOTE $____________________ _______, _____ FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, American Tower, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("AT LP"), American Towers, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AT Inc."), Towersites Monitoring, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Towersites"), American Tower International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AT International") and American Tower LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, with AT LP, AT Inc., Towersites and AT International, the "Borrowers"), promise to pay, on a joint and several basis, to the order of _______________________________________ (hereinafter, together with its successors and assigns, called the "Lender"), in immediately available funds, at such place as is designated in or pursuant to the Loan Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the principal sum of ______________________ AND __/100s DOLLARS ($_________________) of United States funds, or, if less, so much thereof as may from time to time be advanced by the Lender to the Borrowers and is outstanding hereunder, plus interest as hereinafter provided. Such advances and repayments thereof may be endorsed from time to time on the grid attached hereto, but the failure to make such notations (or any error in such notation) shall not affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay, on a joint and several basis, unpaid principal and interest hereunder. Except as otherwise defined or limited herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of February 21, 2003 (as amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") among the Borrowers, the Lender, the other financial institutions party thereto (together with the Lender, the "Lenders"), the Issuing Bank (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and Toronto Dominion (Texas), Inc., as administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent"). The principal amount of this Revolving Loan Note shall be paid in such amounts and at such times as are set forth in Sections 2.5 and 2.7 of the Loan Agreement. A final payment of all principal amounts and other Obligations then outstanding hereunder shall be due and payable in full on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date. The Borrowers shall be entitled to borrow, repay, reborrow, Continue and Convert amounts due hereunder pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement. Prepayment of the principal amount hereof may be made only as provided in the Loan Agreement. The Borrowers hereby promise to pay, on a joint and several basis, interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder as provided in the Loan Agreement. Interest under this Revolving Loan Note shall also be due and payable when this
Revolving Loan Note shall become due (whether at maturity, by reason of acceleration or otherwise). Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest under this Revolving Loan Note, shall bear interest at the Default Rate as provided in the Loan Agreement. No provision of the Loan Agreement or this Revolving Loan Note shall require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of that permitted by Applicable Law. If any excess amount of interest in such respect is provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so provided for, in connection with the Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder, the provisions of this paragraph shall govern and prevail, and neither the Borrowers nor any sureties, guarantors, successors or assigns of the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the excess amount of such interest or any other excess sum paid for the use, forbearance, or detention of sums loaned pursuant hereto. In the event the Borrowers ever pay, or the Lender ever receives, collects or applies as interest any such sum, such amount which would be in excess of the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law shall be applied as a payment in the reduction of the principal, unless the Borrowers shall notify the Lender in writing that it elects to have such excess returned forthwith; and, if the principal has been paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be returned to the Borrowers. Because of the variable nature of the rates of interest applicable to the Revolving Loans evidenced by this Revolving Loan Note, the total interest that will accrue hereon cannot be determined in advance. None of the Borrowers nor the Lender intends for the Lender to contract for, charge or receive usurious interest and, to prevent such an occurrence, any agreements which may now or hereafter be in effect among the Borrowers, or any of them, and the Lender regarding the payment of fees to the Lender are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph. To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, determination of the legal maximum amount of interest shall at all times be made by amortizing, prorating or allocating all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from the Borrowers in connection with the portion of the Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder until the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, so that the actual rate of interest on account of the Revolving Loans outstanding hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount permitted under Applicable Law. All parties now or hereafter liable with respect to this Revolving Loan Note, whether the Borrowers, any guarantor, endorser or any other Person, hereby waive to the extent permitted by Applicable Law presentment for payment, demand, notice of nonpayment or dishonor, protest and notice of protest. No delay or omission on the part of the Lender or any holder hereof in exercising its rights under this Revolving Loan Note, or delay or omission on the part of the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders collectively, in exercising its or their rights under the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or course of conduct relating thereto, shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right of the Lender or any holder hereof, nor shall any waiver by the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders collectively, or any holder hereof, of any such right or rights on any one occasion be deemed a bar to, or waiver of, the same right or rights on any future occasion. -2-
The Borrowers promise to pay, on a joint and several basis, all reasonable costs of collection, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, should this Revolving Loan Note be collected by or through an attorney-at-law or under advice therefrom. Time is of the essence of this Revolving Loan Note. This Revolving Loan Note evidences the Lender's portion of the Revolving Loans under, and is entitled to the benefits and subject to the terms of, the Loan Agreement which contains provisions with respect of the acceleration of the maturity of this Revolving Loan Note upon the happening of certain stated events and provisions for prepayment. This Revolving Loan Note is secured by and is also entitled to the benefits of the Security Documents. This Revolving Loan Note shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of New York.

Regardless of whether any proposed guarantor or any other Person or Persons is, are or shall become in any other way responsible to the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, for or in respect of the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof, and regardless of whether or not any Person or Persons now or hereafter responsible to the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, for the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof, whether under this Guaranty or otherwise, shall cease to be so liable, the Guarantor hereby declares and agrees that this Guaranty is and shall continue to be a several obligation, shall be a continuing guaranty and shall be operative and binding, and that the Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation with respect to this Guaranty. 2. Guaranty Final. Upon the execution and delivery of this Guaranty to the Administrative Agent, this Guaranty shall be deemed to be finally executed and delivered by the Guarantor and shall not be subject to or affected by any promise or condition affecting or limiting the Guarantor's liability (other than as expressly set forth in Section 7 hereof), and no statement, representation, agreement or promise on the part of the Guarantied Parties, the Borrowers, or any of them, or any officer, employee or agent thereof, unless contained herein forms any part of this Guaranty or has induced the making hereof or shall be deemed in any way to affect the Guarantor's liability hereunder. 3. Amendment and Waiver. No alteration or waiver of this Guaranty or of any of its terms, provisions or conditions shall be binding upon the Persons against whom enforcement is sought unless made in writing and signed by an authorized officer of such Person. 4. Dealings with Guarantor. The Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may, from time to time, without exonerating or releasing the Guarantor in any way under this Guaranty, (i) take such further or other security or securities for the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof as the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may deem proper, consistent with the Loan Agreement, or (ii) release, discharge, abandon or otherwise deal with or fail to deal with any guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations or any security or securities therefor or any part thereof now or hereafter -2-
held by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, or (iii) consistent with the Loan Agreement, amend, modify, extend, accelerate or waive in any manner any of the provisions, terms, or conditions of the Guarantied Agreements, all as the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may consider expedient or appropriate in their sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, or of Paragraph 5 hereof, it is understood that the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may, without exonerating or releasing the Guarantor, give up, or modify or abstain from perfecting or taking advantage of any security for the Guarantied Obligations and accept or make any compositions or arrangements, and realize upon any security for the Guarantied Obligations when, and in such manner, as the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may deem expedient, consistent with the Loan Agreement, all without notice to the Guarantor, except as required by Applicable Law. 5. Guaranty Unconditional. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that no change in the nature or terms of the Guarantied Obligations or any of the Guarantied Agreements, or other agreements, instruments or contracts evidencing, related to or attendant with the Guarantied Obligations (including any novation), nor any determination of lack of enforceability thereof, shall discharge all or any part of the liabilities and obligations of the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty; it being the purpose and intent of the Guarantor and the Guarantied Parties that the covenants, agreements and all liabilities and obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are absolute, unconditional and irrevocable under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor agrees that until each and every one of the covenants and agreements of this Guaranty is fully performed, the Guarantor's undertakings hereunder shall not be released, in whole or in part, by any action or thing which might, but for this paragraph of this Guaranty, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor, or by reason of any waiver, omission of the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, or their failure to proceed promptly or otherwise, or by reason of any action taken or omitted by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, whether or not such action or failure to act varies or increases the risk of, or affects the rights or remedies of, the Guarantor or by reason of any further dealings between the Borrowers and the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, or any other guarantor or surety, and the Guarantor, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defense to its liability hereunder, or any right of counterclaim or offset of any nature or description which it may have or which may exist based upon, and shall be deemed to have consented to, any of the foregoing acts, omissions, things, agreements or waivers. 6. Set-off. The Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may, without demand or notice of any kind upon or to the Guarantor, at any time or from time to time when any amount shall be due and payable hereunder by the Guarantor, if the Borrowers shall not have timely paid their Guarantied Obligations, set off and appropriate any property, balances, credit accounts or moneys of the Guarantor (other than those held in a trust) in the possession of the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, or under the control of any of them for any purpose, which property, balances, credit accounts or moneys shall thereupon be turned over and remitted to the Administrative Agent, to be held and applied to the Guarantied Obligations by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement, and the Guarantor hereby grants to the Guarantied Parties, a security interest in all such property. The Administrative Agent shall -3-
give written notice to the Borrowers of the exercise of any of the foregoing rights within one (1) Business Day following the exercise thereof. 7. Maximum Guarantied Amount. The creation or existence from time to time of Guarantied Obligations in excess of the amount committed to or outstanding on the date of this Guaranty is hereby authorized by the Guarantor, without notice to the Guarantor, and shall in no way impair or affect this Guaranty or the rights of the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, herein. Anything in this Guaranty to be contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the Guarantor and the Guarantied Parties, that the Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall be, but not in excess of, the Maximum Guarantied Amount. The "Maximum Guarantied Amount" shall mean the greater of (a) the amount of economic benefit received (directly or indirectly) by the Guarantor pursuant to the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (b) the maximum amount which could be paid out by the Guarantor without rendering this Guaranty void or voidable under Applicable Law including, without limitation, (i) Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended, and (ii) applicable state law regarding fraudulent conveyances. 8. Bankruptcy. Upon the bankruptcy or winding up or other distribution of assets of the Borrowers or any Subsidiary of the Borrowers (other than the Guarantor) or of any surety or guarantor for the Guarantied Obligations, the rights of the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, against the Guarantor shall not be affected or impaired by the omission of the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, to prove its or their claim, as appropriate, or to prove its or their full claim, as appropriate, and the Guarantied Parties may prove such claims as they see fit and may refrain from proving any claim and in their respective discretion they may value as they see fit or refrain from valuing any security held by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, without in any way releasing, reducing or otherwise affecting the liability to the Guarantied Parties of the Guarantor. 9. Application of Payments. Any amount received by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, from whatsoever source and applied toward the payment of the Guarantied Obligations shall be applied in such order of application as is set forth in the Loan Agreement. 10. Waivers by Guarantor. The Guarantor hereby expressly waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty, (b) notice of the existence or creation of all or any of the Guarantied Obligations, (c) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices whatsoever, (d) all diligence in collection or protection of or realization upon the Guarantied Obligations or any part thereof, any obligation hereunder, or any security for any of the foregoing and (e) all rights of subrogation, indemnification, contribution and reimbursement against the Borrowers, all rights to enforce any remedy the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may have against the Borrowers and any benefit of, or right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereinafter held by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, in respect of the Guarantied Obligations, even upon payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. Any money received by the Guarantor in violation of this Section shall be held in trust by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Guarantied Parties. If a claim is ever made upon the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, for the repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received by any of them in payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations and such Person repays all or part of such amount by reason of (a) any judgment, decree, or order of any -4-
court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such Person or any of its property, or (b) any good faith settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by such Person with any such claimant, including any of the Borrowers, then in such event the Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement, or compromise shall be binding upon the Guarantor, notwithstanding any revocation hereof or the cancellation of any promissory note or other instrument evidencing any of the Guarantied Obligations, and the Guarantor shall be and remain obligated to such Person hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by such Person. 11. Assignment by the Guarantied Parties. To the extent permitted under the Loan Agreement, the Guarantied Parties may each, and without notice of any kind, except as otherwise required by the Loan Agreement, sell, assign or transfer all or any of the Guarantied Obligations. The Guarantor shall not assign its rights or obligations under this Guaranty without the consent of the Administrative Agent, nor shall the Guarantor amend this Guaranty, without the consent of the Majority Lenders. In the event of an assignment hereunder, each and every immediate and successive assignee, transferee, or holder of all or any of the Guarantied Obligations, shall have the right to enforce this Guaranty, by suit or otherwise, for the benefit of such assignee, transferee or holder as fully as if such assignee, transferee or holder were herein by name specifically given such rights, powers and benefits. This Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Guarantor. 12. Remedies Cumulative. No delay by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. No action by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, permitted hereunder shall in any way impair or affect this Guaranty. For the purpose of this Guaranty, the Guarantied Obligations shall include, without limitation, all Guarantied Obligations of the Borrowers to the Guarantied Parties notwithstanding any right or power of any third party, individually or in the name of any of the Borrowers or any other Person, to assert any claim or defense as to the invalidity or unenforceability of any such Obligation, and no such claim or defense shall impair or affect the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder. 13. Miscellaneous. This is a Guaranty of payment and not of collection. In the event of a demand upon the Guarantor under this Guaranty, the Guarantor shall be held and bound to the Guarantied Parties directly as debtor in respect of the payment of the amounts hereby Guarantied. All reasonable costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, in obtaining performance of or collecting payments due under this Guaranty shall be deemed part of the Guarantied Obligations Guarantied hereby. Any notice or demand which the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, may wish to give shall be served upon the Guarantor in the fashion prescribed for notices in Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement in care of the Borrowers at the address for the Borrowers set forth in or otherwise provided pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement, and the notice so sent shall be deemed to be served as set forth in Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement. -5-
14. Loans Benefit Guarantor. The Guarantor expressly represents and acknowledges that any financial accommodations by the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, to the Borrowers, including, without limitation, the extension of the Loans, are and will be of direct interest, benefit and advantage to the Guarantor. 15. Solvency. The Guarantor expressly represents and warrants that on the date hereof and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (i) the property of the Guarantor, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debt; (ii) the capital of the Guarantor will not be unreasonably small to conduct its business; (iii) the Guarantor will not have incurred debts, or have intended to incur debts, beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature; and (iv) the present fair salable value of the assets of the Guarantor will be materially greater than the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities (including debts) as they become absolute and matured. For purposes of this Section 15, "debt" means any liability on a claim, and "claim" means (a) the right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, or (b) the right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, undisputed, secured or unsecured. 16. Visits and Inspections. The Guarantor covenants and agrees that so long as any amount is owing on account of Guarantied Obligations or otherwise pursuant to this Guaranty, the Guarantor shall permit representatives of the Guarantied Parties, or any of them, to visit and inspect properties of the Guarantor during normal business hours after reasonable notice, inspect the Guarantor's books and records and discuss with the principal officers of the Guarantor its businesses, assets, liabilities, financial positions, results of operations and business prospects. 17. Governing Law. This Guaranty shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of New York. -6-
18. Jurisdiction and Venue. If any action or proceeding shall be brought by the Administrative Agent in order to enforce any right or remedy under this Guaranty, the Guarantor hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting within the area comprising the Southern District of New York on the date of this Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby agrees, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law that service of the summons and complaint and all other process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding may be effected by mailing by registered mail a copy of such process to the offices of the Borrowers, as set forth in or otherwise provided pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement, and that personal service of process shall not be required. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit service of process by any other method permitted by law, or the bringing of any suit, action or proceeding in any other jurisdiction. The Guarantor agrees that final judgment in such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. 19. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE GUARANTOR WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS GUARANTY. 20. Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to the Guarantor's performance of its obligations hereunder. 21. Administrative Agent. Each reference herein to any right granted to, benefit conferred upon or power exercisable by the "Administrative Agent" shall be a reference to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of all the Guarantied Parties, and each action taken or right exercised hereunder shall be deemed to have been so taken or exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of and on behalf of all the Guarantied Parties.

W I T N E S S E T H: WHEREAS, American Tower, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("AT LP"), American Towers, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AT Inc."), Towersites Monitoring, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Towersites"), American Tower International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("AT International") and American Tower LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, with AT LP, AT Inc., Towersites and AT International, the "Borrowers"), the Lenders (as defined therein), the Issuing Bank (as defined therein) and Toronto Dominion (Texas), Inc., as administrative agent thereunder (the "Administrative Agent", and together with the Lenders, Affiliates of a Lender party to an Interest Hedge Agreement which is a Loan Document and the Issuing Bank, the "Secured Parties") are all parties to that certain Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of February 21, 2003 (as amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, and as in effect on the date hereof, the "Loan Agreement"); and WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Pledgor executed that certain Subsidiary Guaranty dated as of __________ (the "Guaranty") and is required to execute and deliver this Agreement; and WHEREAS, the Pledgor is a Restricted Subsidiary and is engaged in the business of owning and operating communications tower facilities as an integrated operation with the Borrowers and their other Subsidiaries; and WHEREAS, the Pledgor has determined that its execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement directly benefit, and are within the corporate purposes and in the best interests of, the Pledgor; and WHEREAS, to secure the payment and performance by the Borrowers of their Obligations arising under the Loan Agreement, the Pledgor and the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) have agreed that the shares of capital stock (the "Stock") owned by the Pledgor in each of the corporate Restricted Subsidiaries of the Pledgor listed on Schedule 1 attached hereto (the "Subsidiaries") shall be pledged by the Pledgor to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Secured Parties) to secure the Guarantied Obligations (as defined in the Guaranty);
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree that capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan Agreements to the extent not otherwise defined or limited herein, and further agree as follows: 1. Warranty. The Pledgor hereby represents and warrants to the Secured Parties that, except for the security interest created hereby, the Pledgor owns the Stock, which constitutes the percentage of the issued and outstanding stock of the corporate Restricted Subsidiaries as set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto, free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens), that the Stock is duly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and that the Pledgor has the unencumbered right to pledge the Stock. In addition, Pledgor represents and covenants as follows: (1) the Stock represents all of Pledgor's shares of capital stock in any corporate Restricted Subsidiary; (2) upon possession and retention of the Stock by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall have a valid and perfected first priority security interest in the Stock, securing the payment of the Guarantied Obligations; and (3) except as noted on Schedule 2 attached hereto, the Stock represents all the outstanding shares of stock issued by any corporate Restricted Subsidiary of the Pledgor. 2. Security Interest. The Pledgor hereby unconditionally grants and assigns to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, and their respective successors and assigns, a continuing security interest in and security title to the Stock and any other shares of capital stock of any corporate Restricted Subsidiary of the Pledgor obtained in the future, and in each case, all certificates representing such shares, all rights, options, warrants, stock or other securities or other property which may hereafter be received, receivable or distributed in respect of the Stock, together with all proceeds of the foregoing, including, without limitation, all dividends, cash, notes, securities or other property from time to time acquired, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, the foregoing, all of which shall constitute "Stock" hereunder. The Pledgor has delivered to and deposited with the Administrative Agent herewith all of its right, title and interest in and to the Stock, together with certificates representing the Stock, and undated stock powers endorsed in blank, as security for the payment and performance of all of the Guarantied Obligations of the Pledgor and any other obligor to the Secured Parties, or any of them, under this Agreement and the Guaranty and any extensions, renewals or amendments of any of the foregoing, however created, acquired, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due; it being the intention of the parties hereto that beneficial ownership of the Stock, including, without limitation, all voting, consensual and dividend rights, shall remain in the Pledgor until the occurrence and during continuance of an Event of Default and until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Pledgor of the Administrative Agent's exercise of voting and dividend rights to the Stock pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement. 3. Additional Shares. In the event that, during the term of this Agreement: (a) any stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, readjustment, or other change is declared or made in the capital structure of any corporate Restricted Subsidiary -2-
of the Pledgor, or any new stock is issued by such corporate Restricted Subsidiary of the Pledgor, or any new corporate Restricted Subsidiary of the Pledgor is formed or acquired, all new, substituted, and additional shares shall be issued to the Pledgor and shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated stock powers endorsed in blank by the Pledgor, and shall thereupon constitute Stock to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement; and b) any subscriptions, warrants or any other rights or options shall be issued in connection with the Stock, all new stock or other securities acquired through such subscriptions, warrants, rights or options by the Pledgor shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated Stock powers endorsed in blank, and shall thereupon constitute Stock to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement. 4. Default. In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as any such Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Stock at a public or private sale or make other commercially reasonable disposition of the Stock or any portion thereof after fifteen (15) days' notice to the Pledgor and the Secured Parties, or any of them, may purchase the Stock or any portion thereof at any public sale. The proceeds of the public or private sale or other disposition shall be applied first to the costs of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the sale, expressly including, without limitation, any costs under Section 7 hereof, and then as provided in the Loan Agreement. In the event the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the Stock are insufficient to satisfy the Guarantied Obligations, the Pledgor shall remain liable for any such deficiency to the extent provided in the Guaranty. The Pledgor waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the rights of equity of redemption, appraisal, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand and marshalling, to the extent applicable. 5. Additional Rights of Secured Party. In addition to its rights and privileges under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, shall have all the rights, powers and privileges of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction and other Applicable Law. 6. Return of Stock to the Pledgor. Upon payment in full of all principal and interest on the Notes, full performance by the Borrowers of all covenants, undertakings and Obligations under the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and satisfaction in full of any other Guarantied Obligations, other than the Guarantied Obligations which survive the termination of the Loan Agreement as provided in Section 11.16 of the Loan Agreement, and after such time as the Lenders shall have no obligation to make any further Advances to the Borrowers, this Agreement shall terminate and the Administrative Agent shall return the remaining Stock and all rights received by the Administrative Agent as a result of its possessory interest in the Stock to the Pledgor. 7. Disposition of Stock by Administrative Agent. The Stock is not registered or qualified under the various Federal or state securities laws of the United States and disposition -3-
thereof after an Event of Default may be restricted to one or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such registration. The Pledgor understands that upon such disposition, the Administrative Agent may approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further understands that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Stock than if the Stock were registered and qualified pursuant to federal and state securities laws and sold on the open market. The Pledgor, therefore, agrees that: (a) if the Administrative Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, sell or cause the Stock or any portion thereof to be sold at a private sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of any national brokerage or investment firm having recognized expertise and experience in connection with shares of communications tower companies (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial reasonableness of such action) as to the best manner in which to expose the Stock for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable at the private sale thereof; and (b) that such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that the Administrative Agent has handled such disposition in a commercially reasonable manner absent manifest error. 8. Pledgor's Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against the Borrowers or any other Person, nor against other security or liens available to any Secured Party. The Pledgor hereby waives any right to require that an action be brought against any other Person or to require that resort be had to any security or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any of the Secured Parties in favor of any other Person prior to the exercise of remedies hereunder, or to require action hereunder prior to resort by the Administrative Agent to any other security or collateral for the Guarantied Obligations. No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor with respect to the Guarantied Obligations to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Borrowers, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Borrowers or any other person or any other collateral or guaranty by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof, nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Guarantied Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Guarantied Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Guarantied Obligations. None of the Secured Parties shall, by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be -4-
construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion. 9. Voting Rights. (a) For so long as any Guarantied Obligations remain unpaid, after and during the continuation of an Event of Default, but subject to the provisions of Section 15 hereof, (i) the Administrative Agent may, upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to the Pledgor of its intention to do so, exercise all voting rights, and all other ownership or consensual rights of the Stock, but under no circumstances is the Administrative Agent obligated by the terms of this Agreement to exercise such rights, and (ii) the Pledgor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent, which appointment shall be effective on the fifteenth (15th) day following the giving of notice by the Administrative Agent as provided in the foregoing Section 9(a)(i), the Pledgor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and IRREVOCABLE PROXY to vote the Stock in any manner the Administrative Agent deems advisable for or against all matters submitted or which may be submitted to a vote of shareholders. The power-of-attorney granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. (b) For so long as the Pledgor shall have the right to vote the Stock, the Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, vote or take any consensual action with respect to the Stock which would constitute an Event of Default. 10. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Pledgor, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Pledgor or any other collateral or guaranty by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Guarantied Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Guarantied Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Guarantied Obligations and termination of the Commitments. None of the Secured Parties shall by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent or one or more of the Secured Parties in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion. 11. Assignment. The Pledgor hereby agrees that this Agreement or the rights hereunder may, in the discretion of the Secured Parties, or any of them, as applicable, be -5-
assigned by the Secured Parties, or any of them, in whole or in part in connection with any assignment of the Loan Agreement or the Obligations arising thereunder, as permitted thereunder. In the event this Agreement or the rights hereunder are so assigned by any of the Secured Parties, the terms "Administrative Agent" or "Secured Parties," wherever used herein, shall be deemed, as applicable, to refer to and include any such assignee. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Pledgor, but shall apply to and bind the respective successors and permitted assigns of the Pledgor and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Pledgor. 12. Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be given in the fashion set forth in Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement, and with respect to the Pledgor, at the address for the Borrowers set forth in or otherwise provided pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement. 13. Governing Law. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereto determined, in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of New York. This Agreement, together with all documents referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and may not be modified except by a writing executed by the Administrative Agent and the Pledgor and delivered by the Administrative Agent to the Pledgor. 14. Severability. If any paragraph or part thereof shall for any reason be held or adjudged to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such paragraph or part thereof so adjudicated invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall be deemed separate, distinct and independent, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such holding or adjudication. 15. FCC Compliance. Notwithstanding anything herein which may be construed to the contrary, no action shall be taken by the Administrative Agent which may require the consent or approval of the FCC, and the proxy granted in Section 9(a) hereof shall not become effective, unless and until all requirements of the Communications Act requiring the consent to or approval of such action by the FCC have been satisfied. The Pledgor covenants that, following and during the continuation of an Event of Default, upon request of the Administrative Agent, it will cause to be filed such applications and take such other action as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to obtain consent or approval of the FCC to any action contemplated by this Agreement and to give effect to the security interest of the Administrative Agent, including, without limitation, the execution of an application for consent by the FCC to an assignment or transfer involving a change in ownership or control pursuant to the provisions of the Communications Act. 16. Counterparts.

The Subsidiary further agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall in no event be obligated to, following written notice to the Subsidiary, insure any of the Collateral in such form and amount as the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or desirable if the Subsidiary fails to obtain insurance as required by the Loan Agreement, and that the Administrative Agent may pay or discharge any taxes if the Subsidiary fails to pay such taxes as required by the Loan Agreement or Liens (which are not Permitted Liens) on any of the Collateral, and the Subsidiary agrees to pay any such sum so expended by the Administrative Agent, with interest at the Default Rate, and such amounts shall be deemed to be a part of the Obligations secured by the Collateral under the terms of this Agreement. 8. Covenants Regarding Contracts, Other Contracts and Leases.

Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Secured Parties shall have such rights and remedies as are set forth in the Loan Agreement, the other Loan Documents and herein, all the rights, powers and privileges of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York and any other applicable jurisdiction, and all other rights and remedies available to the Secured Parties, or any -6-
of them, at law or in equity. The Subsidiary covenants and agrees that any notification of intended disposition of any Collateral, if such notice is required by law, shall be deemed reasonably and properly given if given in the manner provided for in Section 19 hereof at least ten (10) days prior to such disposition. Under such circumstances, the Secured Parties shall have the right to the appointment of a receiver for the properties and assets of the Subsidiary, and the Subsidiary hereby consents to such rights and to such appointment and hereby waives any objection it may have thereto and hereby waives the right to have a bond or other security posted by the Administrative Agent or any other Person in connection therewith. The Subsidiary agrees, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, to take any actions that the Secured Parties may reasonably request in order to enable the Administrative Agent to obtain and enjoy the full rights and benefits granted to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Subsidiary shall, at the Subsidiary's cost and expense, use its reasonable best efforts to assist in obtaining all approvals of the FCC which are then required by law for or in connection with any action or transaction contemplated by this Agreement or Article 9 of the UCC as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, and, at the Administrative Agent's request, prepare, sign and file with the FCC the assignor's or transferor's portion of any application or applications for consent to the assignment of the Licenses or transfer of control thereof necessary or appropriate under the FCC's rules for approval of any sale or transfer of the Administrative Agent's remedies under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have the right, in connection with the issuance of any order for relief in a bankruptcy proceeding, to petition the bankruptcy court for the transfer of control or assignment of the Collateral to a receiver, trustee, transferee, or similar official or to any purchaser of the Collateral pursuant to any public or private sale, foreclosure or other exercise of remedies available to the Administrative Agent, all as permitted by Applicable Law. All amounts realized or collected through the exercise of remedies hereunder shall be applied to the Obligations as provided in the Loan Agreement. 10. Notification of Account Debtors. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may notify the account debtors that all payments with respect to Accounts are to be paid directly to the Administrative Agent and any amount thereafter paid to the Subsidiary shall be received in trust by the Subsidiary for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and segregated from other funds of the Subsidiary and paid over to the Administrative Agent in the form received (together with any necessary endorsements). 11. Remedies of Administrative Agent. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Administrative Agent or its designee may proceed to perform any and all of the obligations of the Subsidiary contained in any of the Contracts, Other Contracts or Leases and exercise any and all rights of the Subsidiary therein contained as fully as the Subsidiary itself could. The Subsidiary hereby appoints the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution, to take such action, execute such documents, and perform such work as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in exercise of the rights and remedies granted the Secured Parties, or any of them, herein or in any other Loan Document following written notice to the Subsidiary. The powers herein granted shall include, without limitation, powers to: (a) sue on the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases; (b) seek all -7-
governmental approvals (other than FCC approvals) required for the operation of the business of the Subsidiary; (c) modify or terminate the Contracts, the Other Contracts and the Leases; and (d) waive or release the performance or observance of any obligation under any of the Contracts, Other Contracts or Leases. The power of attorney granted herein is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. 12. Additional Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, should the Subsidiary fail to perform or observe any covenant or comply with any condition contained in any of the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases, then following written notice to the Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent may, but without obligation to do so and without releasing the Subsidiary from its obligation to do so, perform such covenant or condition and, to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall incur any reasonable costs or pay any expenses in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any reasonable costs or expenses of litigation associated therewith, such costs, expenses or payments shall be included in the Obligations secured hereby and shall bear interest from the payment of such costs or expenses by the Administrative Agent at the Default Rate. None of the Secured Parties shall be obliged to perform or discharge any obligation of the Subsidiary under any of the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases, and, except as may result from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person seeking indemnification, the Subsidiary agrees to indemnify and hold each Secured Party harmless against any and all liability, loss or damage which any such Person may incur under any of the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases or under or by reason of this Agreement, and any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be asserted against the Subsidiary by reason of an act of any Secured Party under any of the terms of this Agreement or under the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases. 13. Administrative Agent May Collect Accounts. The Subsidiary hereby further appoints the Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution, with authority to collect all Accounts, to endorse the name of the Subsidiary on any note, acceptance, check, draft, money order or other evidence of debt or of payment which constitutes a portion of the Collateral and which may come into the possession of the Secured Parties, or any of them, and generally to do such other things and acts in the name of the Subsidiary with respect to the Collateral as are necessary or appropriate to protect or enforce the rights hereunder of the Secured Parties. The Subsidiary further authorizes the Administrative Agent, effective upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, to compromise and settle or to sell, assign or transfer or to ask, collect, receive or issue any and all claims possessed by the Subsidiary which constitute a portion of the Collateral, all in the name of the Subsidiary. After deducting all reasonable expenses and charges (including, without limitation, the Administrative Agent's attorneys' fees) of retaking, keeping, storing and selling the Collateral, the Administrative Agent may apply the proceeds in payment of any of the Obligations in the order of application set forth in the Loan Agreement. The power of attorney granted herein is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. The Subsidiary agrees that a failure to so notify the Administrative Agent shall be a waiver and bar to any subsequent claim for any such property. The Subsidiary agrees that if steps are taken by the Administrative Agent to enforce its rights hereunder, or to realize upon any of the Collateral, the Subsidiary shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount of the Administrative Agent's reasonable costs, including, without limitation, -8-
attorneys' fees, and the Subsidiary's obligation to pay such amounts shall be deemed to be a part of the Obligations secured hereunder. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Subsidiary shall segregate all proceeds of any Collateral from other assets of the Subsidiary. 14. Indemnification. The Subsidiary shall indemnify and hold harmless each Secured Party and any other Person acting hereunder for all losses, costs, damages, fees and expenses whatsoever associated with the exercise of the powers of attorney granted herein and shall release each Secured Party and any other Person acting hereunder from all liability whatsoever for the exercise of the foregoing powers of attorney and all actions taken pursuant thereto, except, in either event, in the case of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Person seeking indemnification. 15. Remedies Cumulative. The Subsidiary agrees that the rights of the Secured Parties, or any of them, under this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other contract or agreement now or hereafter in existence among the Secured Parties and the Subsidiary and the other obligors thereunder, or any of them, shall be cumulative, and that each Secured Party may from time to time exercise such rights and such remedies as such Person or Persons may have thereunder and under the laws of the United States or any state, as applicable, in the manner and at the time that such Person or Persons in its or their sole discretion desire, subject to the terms of such agreements. The Subsidiary further expressly agrees that the Secured Parties shall in no event be under any obligation to resort to any Collateral secured hereby prior to exercising any other rights that the Secured Parties, or any of them, may have against the Subsidiary or its property, nor shall the Secured Parties be obliged to resort to any other collateral or security for the Obligations, other than the Collateral, prior to any exercise of the Administrative Agent's rights against the Subsidiary and its property hereunder. 16. Obligations Commercial in Nature. The Subsidiary hereby acknowledges that the Obligations arose out of a commercial transaction, and agrees that if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, have the right to immediate possession without notice or a hearing, and hereby knowingly and intelligently waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all rights it may have to any notice and posting of a bond by the Secured Parties, or any of them, prior to seizure by the Administrative Agent or any of its transferees, assigns or successors in interest of the Collateral or any portion thereof. 17. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreements or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Subsidiary or any other obligor to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Borrowers, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Subsidiary by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof, nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Subsidiary from any Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative -9-
Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Obligations and termination of the Commitment. None of the Secured Parties shall by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion. 18. Assignment. The Subsidiary agrees that this Agreement or the rights hereunder may, in the discretion of the Secured Parties, or any of them, as applicable, be assigned by the Secured Parties, or any of them, in whole or in part in connection with any assignment of the Loan Agreement or the Obligations arising thereunder, as permitted thereunder. In the event this Agreement or the rights hereunder are so assigned by any of the Secured Parties, the terms "Secured Parties" or "Administrative Agent" wherever used herein shall be deemed, as applicable, to refer to and include any such assignee. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Borrowers without the consent of the Administrative Agent, but shall apply to and bind the respective successors and permitted assigns of the Subsidiary and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Subsidiary. 19.

This Agreement, together with all documents referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the Subsidiary and the Secured Parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and may not be modified except by a writing executed by the Administrative Agent and delivered to the Subsidiary. 21. Severability. If any paragraph or part thereof of this Agreement shall for any reason be held or adjudged to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such paragraph or part thereof so adjudicated invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall be deemed separate, distinct and independent, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by such holding or adjudication. 22. FCC Compliance. Notwithstanding anything herein which may be construed to the contrary, no action shall be taken by the Administrative Agent which may require the consent or approval of the FCC, unless and until all requirements of Applicable Law, including, without limitation any required approval under the Communications Act, requiring the consent to or approval of such action by the FCC or any governmental or other authority have been satisfied. -10-
The Subsidiary covenants that, following and during the continuation of an Event of Default, upon request of the Administrative Agent, it will cause to be filed such applications and take such other action as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to obtain consent or approval of the FCC to any action contemplated by this Agreement and to give effect to the security interest of the Administrative Agent, including, without limitation, the execution of an application for consent by the FCC to an assignment or transfer involving a change in ownership or control pursuant to the provisions of the Communications Act. 23. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such separate counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 24. Changes in Applicable Law. The parties acknowledge their intent that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof, the Administrative Agent shall receive, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and governmental policy (including, without limitation, the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC), all rights necessary or desirable to obtain, use or sell the Collateral and to exercise all remedies available to it under this Agreement, the UCC as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, or other Applicable Law. The parties further acknowledge and agree that, in the event of changes in law or governmental policy occurring subsequent to the date hereof that affect in any manner the Administrative Agent's rights of access to, or use or sale of, the Collateral, or the procedures necessary to enable the Administrative Agent to obtain such rights of access, use or sale, the Administrative Agent and the Subsidiary shall amend this Agreement in such manner as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request in order to provide the Administrative Agent such rights to the greatest extent possible consistent with Applicable Law and governmental policy. 25. Administrative Agent. Each reference herein to any right granted to, benefit conferred upon or power exercisable by the "Administrative Agent" shall be a reference to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of all the Secured Parties, and each action taken or right exercised hereunder shall be deemed to have been so taken or exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of and on behalf of all the Secured Parties. 26. Jurisdiction and Venue. If any action or proceeding shall be brought by the Administrative Agent in order to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement, the Subsidiary hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting within the area comprising the Southern District of New York on the date of this Agreement. The Subsidiary hereby agrees, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law that service of the summons and complaint and all other process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding may be effected by mailing by registered mail a copy of such process to the offices of the Borrowers, as set forth in or otherwise provided pursuant to Section 11.1 of the Loan Agreement, and that personal service of process shall not be required.

Except as otherwise defined or limited herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in that certain Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of February 21, 2003 (as amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") among the Borrowers, the Lender, the other financial institutions party thereto (together with the Lender, the "Lenders"), the Issuing Bank (as defined therein) and Toronto Dominion (Texas), Inc., as administrative agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"). The principal amount of this Term Loan A Note shall be paid in such amounts and at such times as are set forth in Sections 2.5 and 2.7 of the Loan Agreement. A final payment of all principal amounts and other Obligations then outstanding hereunder shall be due and payable in full on the Term Loan A Maturity Date. The Borrowers shall be entitled to borrow, repay, Continue and Convert amounts due hereunder pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement. Prepayment of the principal amount hereof may be made only as provided in the Loan Agreement. The Borrowers hereby promise to pay, on a joint and several basis, interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Term Loan A Loans outstanding hereunder as provided in the Loan Agreement. Interest under this Term Loan A Note shall also be due and payable when this Term
Loan A Note shall become due (whether at maturity, by reason of acceleration or otherwise). Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, overdue interest under this Term Loan A Note, shall bear interest at the Default Rate as provided in the Loan Agreement. No provision of the Loan Agreement or this Term Loan A Note shall require the payment or permit the collection of interest in excess of that permitted by Applicable Law. If any excess amount of interest in such respect is provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so provided for, in connection with the Term Loan A Loans outstanding hereunder, the provisions of this paragraph shall govern and prevail, and none of the Borrowers nor any sureties, guarantors, successors or assigns of the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay the excess amount of such interest or any other excess sum paid for the use, forbearance, or detention of sums loaned pursuant hereto. In the event the Borrowers ever pay, or the Lender ever receives, collects or applies as interest any such sum, such amount which would be in excess of the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law shall be applied as a payment in the reduction of the principal, unless the Borrowers shall notify the Lender in writing that it elects to have such excess returned forthwith; and, if the principal has been paid in full, any remaining excess shall forthwith be returned to the Borrowers. Because of the variable nature of the rates of interest applicable to the Term Loan A Loans evidenced by this Term Loan A Note, the total interest that will accrue hereon cannot be determined in advance. None of the Borrowers nor the Lender intends for the Lender to contract for, charge or receive usurious interest and, to prevent such an occurrence, any agreements which may now or hereafter be in effect among the Borrowers and the Lender regarding the payment of fees to the Lender are hereby limited by the provisions of this paragraph. To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, determination of the legal maximum amount of interest shall at all times be made by amortizing, prorating or allocating all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from the Borrowers in connection with the portion of the Term Loan A Loans outstanding hereunder until the Term Loan A Maturity Date, so that the actual rate of interest on account of the Term Loan A Loans outstanding hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount permitted under Applicable Law. All parties now or hereafter liable with respect to this Term Loan A Note, whether the Borrowers, any guarantor, endorser or any other Person, hereby waive to the extent permitted by Applicable Law presentment for payment, demand, notice of nonpayment or dishonor, protest and notice of protest. No delay or omission on the part of the Lender or any holder hereof in exercising its rights under this Term Loan A Note, or delay or omission on the part of the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders collectively, in exercising its or their rights under the Loan Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or course of conduct relating thereto, shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right of the Lender or any holder hereof, nor shall any waiver by the Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders collectively, or any holder hereof, of any such right or rights on any one occasion be deemed a bar to, or waiver of, the same right or rights on any future occasion. -2-
The Borrowers promise to pay, on a joint and several basis, all reasonable costs of collection, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, should this Term Loan A Note be collected by or through an attorney-at-law or under advice therefrom.

Page 2 of 12 goodwill on January 1, 2002.

Results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2002 include approximately $4 million of net, non-recurring positive items, primarily resulting from a lease buyout from a customer. Steve Dodge, American Tower's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "2002 was a year of operational and strategic execution. Throughout the year, we stated that we would continue to deliver solid tower performance and margin expansion; execute and complete comprehensive operational initiatives; and execute certain strategic transactions, including the sale of certain service companies, a plan for the separation of Verestar and the resolution of the October 2003 putable convert. We believe we have delivered on all of these commitments. "In the face of a very challenging telecom market, we continue to experience steady organic growth in our tower rental business. Our organic same tower revenue and cash flow growth, which represent the increase in revenue and cash flow on the towers we owned at both the end of the fourth quarter 2002 and the beginning of the fourth quarter 2001, are a strong 15% and 22%, respectively. "In November 2001, we said we would accelerate the process of shifting our focus from acquisitions and development activities to operational execution. During 2002 we simplified and streamlined the organization, moving from five regions and twenty areas to three regions and ten areas, we pulled our lease processing and accounting operations out of the regions and centralized them, and we integrated our construction unit and tower operations unit into one. These activities resulted in a significant increase in productivity per employee, sharply improved margin performance, and faster and more consistent delivery on behalf of customers. Notably, we also significantly tightened our return criteria for new builds, resulting in greatly reduced capital spending. "In addition, we announced a series of strategic transactions which have significantly improved the company's overall asset mix. To date, we have announced or closed the sale of approximately $200 million of non-core assets and have announced our intention to divest additional non-core assets, including our Verestar subsidiary, over the course of 2003. We also announced that we would be using $100 million of proceeds from our asset sales to acquire strategic tower assets. As a result of these initiatives, we have improved the quality of our cash flow by downsizing or eliminating our more volatile businesses and investing selectively in high return, tower assets. "As a result of our solid tower performance and related initiatives, we have reduced our leverage by nearly three full turns over the course of 2002. Importantly, we were able to meet our internal goal of achieving Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter, one quarter earlier than forecast. Finally, as a result of our new financing and subsequent bank amendment the October 2003 putable convert's days are numbered. "Good people make good things happen, and I'd like to acknowledge the fine work of our senior team and of our managers and employees throughout the company. I am betting on this group to keep delivering." OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS As noted above, results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2002 include approximately $4 million of net, non-recurring positive items, primarily resulting from a lease buyout. The following metrics are presented excluding the $4 million of net, non-recurring positive items to facilitate period to period operational comparisons. (Continued)
Page 3 of 12 Organic same tower revenue and cash flow growth in the fourth quarter 2002 on the 12,199 North American towers owned as of the beginning of the fourth quarter 2001 and the end of the fourth quarter 2002 was 15% and 22%, respectively. Annualized lease-up activity on the 13,007 wireless towers owned at the beginning and the end of the fourth quarter 2002 was 0.22 broadband equivalent (BBE) tenants per tower, excluding contractual step downs in certain paging contracts and the effect of the lease buyout included in the net, non-recurring positive items described above. Our BBE lease-up is calculated net of churn, excludes anchor tenants on build-to-suit towers and contractual escalators, and does not consider the growth on broadcast towers. Tower cash flow increased 31% to $91.9 million and margins improved to 63.4%, a 692 basis point increase from the same period in 2001. On a sequential basis, tower cash flow increased $6.3 million and margins improved approximately 190 basis points in the fourth quarter 2002 from the third quarter 2002. The incremental margin expansion was achieved through a combination of organic revenue growth and active management of costs. Free Cash Flow was $6 million in the fourth quarter 2002. ASSET TRANSACTIONS On page 11 of this release, the Company has provided a schedule of its publicly announced strategic transactions. The Company is continuing to pursue strategic divestitures of non-core assets and anticipates additional strategic activity in the first quarter 2003 and beyond. FINANCING HIGHLIGHTS In January 2003, the Company and its subsidiary, American Tower Escrow Corporation ("Escrow Corporation"), completed an approximately $420 million offering, consisting of 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes of Escrow Corporation and warrants to purchase class A common stock of the Company. The purpose of the financing was to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities by prepaying a portion of our outstanding term loans and replacing a portion of the revolving loan capacity, and to obtain bank consent to enable the Company to fund purchases of its 2.25% convertible notes due 2009. In February 2003, the Company successfully amended its credit facilities to allow the Company to consummate the merger of Escrow Corporation with American Towers, Inc. and to use the proceeds from the offering to repurchase the 2.25% convertible notes. In connection with the amendment, the Company will prepay $200 million of term loans under the credit facilities and reduce the revolving loan commitments thereunder by $225 million to $425 million. The credit facilities also were amended to modify and add certain provisions. The Company (upon consummation of the merger described above which is expected to occur later this month) has the right to use $217 million to pay, repurchase, redeem, or retire the 2.25% convertible notes. If the put option of the holders of the 2.25% convertible notes is satisfied by other means or if it is not exercised in full by the holders, the Company may use any remaining funds to pay, repurchase, redeem, or retire any convertible or senior notes of the Company until June 30, 2004. If the Company has not completely utilized the $217 million for convertible and senior note purchases by June 30, 2004, the Company will be required to apply any remaining cash to prepayments of the term loans under its credit facilities. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $127 million in cash and had not drawn on its revolving loan facility since April, 2002. Based on the financial covenants of the amended credit facilities, the Company has the ability to draw the entire undrawn portion of its $425 million revolving loan. The undrawn and available portion amounts to $246 million, which is the $425 million total less $160 million outstanding on the revolving loan less $19 million in outstanding letters of credit. Combined with cash on hand as of December 31, 2002, the Company had a total of $373 million in total liquidity, pro forma for the credit facilities amendment. (Continued)

ABOUT EBITDA, EBITDA BEFORE RESTRUCTURING, TOWER CASH FLOW AND FREE CASH FLOW We do not consider EBITDA, EBITDA before restructuring, tower cash flow and free cash flow as substitutes for other measures of profitability or liquidity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. EBITDA, EBITDA before restructuring tower cash flow and free cash flow are not calculated in accordance with GAAP: however, we have included them in this release as additional information because they are commonly used in the communications site industry as a measure of a company's operating performance. More specifically, we believe they can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measure of EBITDA, EBITDA before restructuring, tower cash flow and free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached to this release. (Continued)

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) continuation of the current U.S. economic slowdown, which could materially and adversely affect our business; (3) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results by restricting our ability to allocate capital to income producing assets; (4) restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior and convertible notes could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness of our tenants; (7) if we issue a significant amount of equity securities, the trading price for our shares of Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected; (8) operations in foreign countries could lead to expropriations, government regulations, funds inaccessibility, foreign exchange exposure and management problems; and (9) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Business Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, which we incorporate herein by reference.

Page 7 of 12 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (A) As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142). Accordingly, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill on January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 142 reduced amortization expense in continuing and discontinued operations by approximately $24.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2002 and $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, the adoption of SFAS 142 resulted in the Company recognizing a $577.0 million (before giving effect to an income tax benefit of $14.4 million) non-cash charge related to goodwill impairment within our Satellite and Fiber Network Access Services segment ($189.2 million) and our Network Development Services segment ($387.8 million). (B) During 2002, the Company committed to the disposal of its entire Satellite and Fiber Network Access Services segment and certain components within its Rental and Management and Services segments. Accordingly, the above statements of operations have been adjusted to reflect the results of these operations as discontinued operations.
