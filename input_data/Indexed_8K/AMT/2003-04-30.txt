 American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2003.
Boston, Massachusetts  April 30, 2003
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2003, revenues decreased to $177.2 million, from $186.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2002, while rental and management revenues increased to $146.5 million from $126.6 million, reflecting the Company's strategic focus on its core rental and management operations and selective reduction of its services operations. Loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to $80.4 million, or $0.41 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2003 from $56.1 million, or $0.29 per share, for the same period in 2002. Net loss decreased to $91.6 million, or $0.47 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2003 from $634.4 million, or $3.25 per share, for the same period in 2002. The period ended March 31, 2002 included a $562.6 million, or $2.88 per share, charge for cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the adoption of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".
 
EBITDA ("operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and impairments and net loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets plus interest income, TV Azteca, net") increased to $89.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003 from $66.4 million for the same period in 2002. Rental and management segment operating profit ("rental and management revenue less rental and management operating expenses plus interest income, TV Azteca, net") increased to $95.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003 from $73.1 million for the same period in 2002. The Company generated free cash flow ("EBITDA less interest expense and capital expenditures incurred, excluding acquisitions and divestitures") of $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2003.
 
In February 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a rental building. Accordingly, results for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the rental building as discontinued operations, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). As a result, rental and management revenue and rental and management segment operating profit were reduced by approximately $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the first quarter 2003 and by $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the same period in the prior year.
 
Steve Dodge, American Tower's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We feel good about the work we were able to get done in the first quarter. We continued to progress operationally, with solid organic revenue gains from our tower division, pronounced margin expansion, and a continuation of the free cash flow theme that began in Q-4 of last year. Customer leasing activity levels at our sites are consistent with our forecast, and may be firming some as we look into the second quarter and beyond. We remain confident that our tower division, which contributes more than 95% of the Company's operating cash flow, will perform to plan for the balance of year. While services were soft and may continue to be for a period of time, the strategic steps we have taken to diminish our exposure to this segment are clearly paying off.

"We also completed a $420 million units offering during the quarter, which produced a range of benefits, most particularly the ability to take out the 2003 convert. As well, through this zero coupon financing and the subsequent reduction and amendment to our credit facilities, we have set the stage for significant and ongoing gains in liquidity. Further, we now have the flexibility to opportunistically apply our growing free cash flow to a range of debt reduction alternatives.
 
"Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the quarter has been to see our investors making money once again. We appreciate their continued and renewed support, and we aim to keep on delivering."
 
Operating Highlights
 
Organic same tower revenue and same tower cash flow growth on the 12,854 North American towers owned as of the beginning of the first quarter 2002 and the end of the first quarter 2003 was 14% and 19%, respectively.
 
Rental and management segment operating profit increased 30% to $95.3 million and rental and management segment operating profit margins improved to 65.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2003, from 57.7% in the same period in 2002. On a sequential basis and excluding approximately $4 million of net non-recurring positive items in the fourth quarter 2002, rental and management segment operating profit increased approximately $4 million and margins improved from 63.5% in the fourth quarter 2002.
 
Free cash flow of $7 million was generated in the first quarter 2003, which reflects approximately $15 million of non-cash interest expense from the accretion of our discount notes and amortization of deferred financing costs.
 
Asset Transactions
 
During the first quarter 2003, the Company closed on $72.2 million of previously announced divestitures including Maritime Telecommunications Network, a subsidiary of Verestar; Flash Technologies, its remaining service components business; and certain rental buildings and non-core tower assets.
 
As stated above, in February 2003 the Company signed an agreement to sell a rental building for a purchase price of approximately $18.5 million, including approximately $2.4 million cash proceeds and the buyer's assumption of $16.1 million of related debt. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted its March 31, 2003 and 2002 financial statements, as well as its 2003 Outlook, to reflect the rental building as discontinued operations. The Company anticipates that it may sell in excess of $50 million of additional non-core assets in the remainder of 2003, including the $18.5 million described above.
 
The Company has closed approximately $56.5 million of the $100 million NII Holdings Inc. tower acquisition, as of the end of the first quarter 2003, including approximately $30.3 million in the first quarter 2003. The Company now expects to close the remaining $43.5 million of the NII Holdings Inc. acquisition in stages throughout the remainder of 2003.
 
Financing Highlights
 
In January 2003, the Company and its subsidiary, American Towers, Inc. ("ATI"), completed an approximately $420 million units offering, consisting of 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes of ATI and warrants to purchase class A common stock of the Company.
 
In February 2003, the Company successfully amended its credit facilities to allow the Company to use the proceeds from the offering to repurchase the 2.25% convertible notes. In connection with the amendment, the Company prepaid $200 million of term loans under the credit facilities and reduced the revolving loan commitments by $225 million to $425 million.

As a result of the offering and the amendment, the Company has the right to use $217 million of restricted cash and investments to pay, repurchase, redeem, or retire the 2.25% convertible notes. If the put option of the holders of the 2.25% convertible notes is satisfied by other means, the Company may use any remaining funds to pay, repurchase, redeem, or retire any convertible or senior notes of the Company until June 30, 2004.
 
During the first quarter 2003, the Company exchanged $4 million of principal value (approximately $3.2 million accreted value) of the 2.25% convertible for approximately 600,000 shares of its Class A common stock. The company recorded a non-cash charge of $2.7 million associated with this transaction.
 
In April 2003, the Company closed additional exchanges of approximately $67.5 million of principal value (approximately $53.3 million accreted value as of March 31, 2003) for approximately 6,572,000 shares of its Class A common stock and $18.5 million in cash. The company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $29 million associated with these transactions in the second quarter 2003 and has included this charge in its revised outlook.
 
As of March 31, 2003, the Company had $318.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, including the $217 million of restricted cash and investments, and had not drawn on its revolving loan facility since April, 2002. Based on the financial covenants of the amended credit facilities, the Company has the ability to draw the entire undrawn portion of its $425 million revolving loan. The undrawn and available portion of the revolving loan amounts to approximately $237.9 million, which is the $425 million total less $2.9 million of pro-rata prepayments from the proceeds of the sale of Maritime Telecommunications Network, $157.1 million outstanding on the revolving loan and $27.1 million in outstanding letters of credit. Combined with cash on hand as of March 31, 2003, the Company had a total of $556.5 million in total liquidity.
 
Quarterly and Full Year 2003 Outlook
 
On page 10 of this release, the Company has provided its 2003 outlook on a full year and quarterly basis for each of its two operating segments.
 
The Company anticipates a solid lease-up environment for its existing towers for the remainder of 2003 and maintains its expectation for organic revenue growth rates of 10% to 14%. The Company has adjusted its rental and management outlook to reflect first quarter 2003 actual results, the reduction of $4 million in annual rental and management revenues related to the discontinued operations of the rental building and the slower than anticipated closings on the NII Holdings transaction.
 
The Company has adjusted its revenue and operating profit outlook for its services segment to better reflect current business trends.
 
The Company has adjusted its expectation for total capital expenditures incurred of between $50 million and $65 million. Rental and Management capital expenditures incurred are expected to range from $45 million to $55 million, including $25 million to $35 million for constructing 100 to 150 new wireless towers, and approximately $20 million for tower maintenance and augmentation. Services and Corporate capital expenditures incurred are expected to range from $2 million to $5 million and Verestar capital expenditures incurred are expected to range from $3 million to $5 million.

About EBITDA, Same tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and EBITDA Margin
 
We do not consider EBITDA, same tower cash flow, free cash flow, and EBITDA margin as substitutes for other measures of profitability or liquidity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. EBITDA, same tower cash flow, free cash flow, and EBITDA margin are not calculated in accordance with GAAP; however, we have included them in this release as additional information because they are commonly used in the communications site industry as a measure of a company's operating performance. More specifically, we believe they can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measure of EBITDA, same tower cash flow, free cash flow, and EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are included on page 11 of this release. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached on pages 5-8 of this release.
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) continuation of the current U.S. economic slowdown, which could materially and adversely affect our business; (3) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results by restricting our ability to allocate capital to income producing assets; (4) restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior and discount notes could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness of our tenants; (7) if we issue a significant amount of equity securities, the trading price for our shares of Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected; (8) operations in foreign countries could lead to expropriations, government regulations, funds inaccessibility, foreign exchange exposure and management problems; and (9) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Business Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, which we incorporate herein by reference. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.
