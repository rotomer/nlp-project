 American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003.
Boston, Massachusetts  July 24, 2003
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2003, rental and management segment revenues increased to $151.9 million from $132.0 million for the same period in 2002. Total revenues increased to $178.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from $165.8 million for the same period in 2002. Loss from continuing operations increased to $81.0 million, or $0.40 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2003 from $67.7 million, or $0.35 per share, for the same period in 2002. Net loss increased to $107.7 million, or $0.53 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2003 from $101.2 million, or $0.52 per share, for the same period in 2002. Loss from continuing operations and net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2003 include a non-cash charge of $35.8 million or $0.18 per share related to several convertible note exchanges.
 
Adjusted EBITDA ("income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization and impairments and net loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets plus interest income, TV Azteca, net") increased to $96.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 from $72.9 million for the same period in 2002. Rental and management segment operating profit ("rental and management revenue less rental and management operating expenses plus interest income, TV Azteca, net") increased to $101.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 from $78.4 million for the same period in 2002. The Company generated free cash flow ("adjusted EBITDA less interest expense and capital expenditures incurred, excluding acquisitions and divestitures") of $14.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003.
 
During the second quarter 2003, the Company also committed to sell its steel fabrication and tall tower construction service subsidiary, Kline Iron & Steel Co., Inc. As a result of its intention to sell Kline Iron & Steel Co. Inc. within the next twelve months, the Company has designated Kline Iron & Steel Co. Inc. as discontinued operations for the second quarter 2003, six months ended 2003 and for comparative periods shown for 2002, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, services revenue and services segment operating profit were reduced by $10.7 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the second quarter 2003 and by $24.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the same period in the prior year.
 
Steve Dodge, American Tower's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Solid organic revenue growth from towers of 12%, coupled with tight spending controls keyed strong margin expansion and significant gains in sequential quarterly adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We see these patterns continuing through this year and beyond.
 
While our customers are also focused on delivering free cash flow, the demands on their networks are increasing, so the deployment of coverage and capacity sites continues. As the correlation between network quality and financial performance grows stronger, and as certain companies effectively promote
 
perceived network advantages, we believe the motivation to invest in new sites and site upgrades will intensify.
 
It has been particularly satisfying for me to observe the work of our managers, who keep delivering on a range of initiatives, both operational and financial. The gains we have experienced each quarter are taking on an aspect of consistency and predictability, which bodes well for our future, and for which our managers deserve much credit."
 
Operating Highlights
 
Organic same tower revenue and same tower cash flow growth on the 13,534 North American towers owned as of the beginning of the second quarter 2002 and the end of the second quarter 2003 was 12% and 19%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2003 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2002.
 
Rental and management segment operating profit increased 29% to $101.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from $78.4 million for the same period in 2002. Rental and management segment operating profit margins improved to 66.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from 59.4% in the same period in 2002.
 
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $96.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from $72.9 million for the same period in 2002. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 54.0% for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from 43.9% in the same period in 2002.
 
Free cash flow of $14.2 million was generated in the second quarter 2003, which includes a deduction of approximately $20.3 million for non-cash interest expense from the accretion of our discount notes and amortization of deferred financing costs. (Excluding the $20.3 million of non-cash interest expense would result in free cash flow of $34.4 million.)
 
Asset Transactions
 
During the second quarter 2003, the Company closed on $21.3 million of divestitures, consisting of $5.2 million of cash proceeds and the elimination of $16.1 million of long-term debt. Divestitures during the second quarter 2003 included certain non-core tower assets and an office building, recorded as discontinued operation in the first quarter, within our rental and management segment.
 
As stated above, the Company intends to sell Kline Iron & Steel Co. Inc. in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has adjusted its June 30, 2003 and 2002 financial statements, as well as its 2003 Outlook, to reflect this services business as discontinued operations. The Company has recognized a $14.0 million impairment in the value of this subsidiary in the current period, resulting in a carrying value as of June 30, 2003 of $16.4 million, which is included on our balance sheet as net assets and liabilities held for sale. The Company has also recognized an additional $12.0 million impairment in the value of its Verestar subsidiary, thus reducing its carrying value to $0. The Company anticipates that it may receive in excess of $30 million of proceeds from the sale of additional non-core assets in the remainder of 2003, including the potential proceeds from the sale of Kline Iron & Steel Co. Inc.
 
The Company has closed approximately $67.1 million of the $100 million NII Holdings Inc. tower acquisition, as of the end of the second quarter 2003, including approximately $10.6 million in the second quarter 2003. The Company expects to close the remaining $32.9 million of the NII Holdings Inc. acquisition in stages throughout the remainder of 2003.
 
In June 2003, the Company filed an income tax refund claim with the Internal Revenue Service relating to net operating losses generated by the Company in 1998, 1999 and 2001. The Company plans to file a similar claim in September 2003, with respect to net operating losses generated in 2002. The Company anticipates receiving approximately $90 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of the Company's deferred tax asset. The Company estimates receipt of this amount within one to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS.
 
Financing Highlights
 
As of June 30, 2003, the Company had $300.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $192.9 million of restricted cash and investments. As of June 30, 2003, the Company had the ability to draw $237.8 million of its revolving loan, which represents the undrawn and available portion of that loan. Combined with cash on hand as of June 30, 2003, the Company had a total of $538.3 million in total liquidity (which includes $192.9 million of restricted cash and investments).
 
During the second quarter 2003, the Company repaid or eliminated a total of $103.2 million of debt, consisting of $70.7 million of accreted value of its 2.25% convertible notes, $18.9 million of mortgages and other debt, and $13.6 million of scheduled payments on its senior secured credit facilities. To date, the Company has paid $27.2 million of scheduled payments and $224.5 million of prepayments on its senior secured credit facilities.
 
During the second quarter 2003 and excluding previously announced transactions, the Company exchanged approximately $22.0 million of principal value (approximately $17.4 million accreted value) of its 2.25% convertible notes for approximately 1.2 million shares of its Class A common stock and $6.4 million in cash. The Company recorded a non-cash charge of $6.8 million associated with these additional transactions for a total of $35.8 million in non-cash charges including previously announced transactions in the second quarter 2003. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Company exchanged approximately $93.5 million of principal value (approximately $73.9 million accreted value) of the 2.25% convertible notes for approximately 8.4 million shares of its Class A common stock and $24.8 million in cash.
 
As of June 30, 2003, the accreted value of the remaining 2.25% convertible notes that may be put to the Company on October 22, 2003 was $140.1 million. The Company had $192.9 million of restricted cash and investments, as of June 30, 2003, that may be used to retire the remaining 2.25% convertible notes. Restricted cash and investments in excess of the accreted value of the remaining 2.25% convertible notes may be used to retire the Company's other senior and convertible notes.
 
Quarterly and Full Year 2003 Outlook
 
On page 9 of this release, the Company has provided its 2003 outlook on a full year and quarterly basis for each of its two operating segments.
 
The Company anticipates a solid lease-up environment for its existing towers for the remainder of 2003 and maintains its expectation for sequential organic revenue growth rates of 10% to 14%. The Company has adjusted its rental and management outlook to reflect second quarter 2003 actual results and the lower than anticipated level of new tower development and closings of the NII Holdings, Inc. acquisition.
 
The Company has adjusted its full year 2003 services revenue outlook to $89 million to $106 million and full year 2003 services segment operating profit outlook to $6 million to $10 million to reflect the discontinued operations of its steel fabrication and tall tower construction service subsidiary, Kline Iron & Steel Co., Inc., and current business conditions.
 
The Company has adjusted its expectation for full year 2003 total capital expenditures incurred to between $48 million and $56 million. Rental and Management capital expenditures incurred are expected to range from $39 million to $46 million, including $22 million to $24 million for constructing approximately 100 new wireless towers, and approximately $17 to $22 million for tower maintenance and augmentation. Services and corporate capital expenditures incurred are expected to range from $4 million to $5 million and Verestar capital expenditures incurred are expected to be approximately $5 million.

About Adjusted EBITDA, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
 
We do not consider adjusted EBITDA, same tower cash flow, free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA margin as substitutes for other measures of profitability or liquidity determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA, same tower cash flow, free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA margin are not calculated in accordance with GAAP; however, we have included them in this release as additional information because they are commonly used in the communications site industry as a measure of a company's operating performance. More specifically, we believe they can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measure of adjusted EBITDA, same tower cash flow, free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are included on page 10 of this release. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached on pages 5-7 of this release.
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, the future divestiture of Kline Iron & Steel Co. Inc. and its financial impact on the Company, our anticipated income tax refund claim, our revised quarterly and full year 2003 Outlook, and planned future asset sales. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) continuation of the current U.S. economic slowdown, which could materially and adversely affect our business; (3) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results by restricting our ability to allocate capital to income producing assets; (4) restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior and discount notes could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness of our tenants; (7) if we issue a significant amount of equity securities, the trading price for our shares of Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected; (8) operations in foreign countries could lead to expropriations, government regulations, funds inaccessibility, foreign exchange exposure and management problems; (9) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues; (10) our inability to complete our planned asset sales or realize the amount of proceeds we currently expect from such sales; and (11) if we are unsuccessful in realizing our anticipated income tax refund claim. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Business Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, which we incorporate herein by reference. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.
