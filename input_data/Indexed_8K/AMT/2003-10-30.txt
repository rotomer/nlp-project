 American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.
Boston, Massachusetts  October 30, 2003
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2003, rental and management segment revenues increased to $158.2 million from $138.2 million for the same period in 2002. Total revenues increased to $186.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003, from $174.9 million for the same period in 2002. Loss from continuing operations decreased to $37.7 million, or $0.18 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2003 from $147.9 million, or $0.76 per share, for the same period in 2002. Net loss decreased to $52.9 million, or $0.25 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2003 from $353.9 million, or $1.81 per share, for the same period in 2002.
 
Adjusted EBITDA ("income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization and impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets plus interest income, TV Azteca, net") increased 28% to $100.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 from $78.8 million for the same period in 2002. The Company generated free cash flow ("adjusted EBITDA less interest expense and capital expenditures incurred, excluding acquisitions and divestitures") of $20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003.
 
Jim Taiclet, American Tower's Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our strong third quarter performance, year-over-year increases of 15% in tower revenue and 28% in adjusted EBITDA, was driven by continued focus on operational execution. Our demonstrated ability to sustain top line growth while managing costs and capital expenditures resulted in our third consecutive quarter of increasing, positive free cash flow.
 
"This steady expansion of free cash flow has enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet. The cash flow from operations, combined with the proceeds from non-core business divestitures and our recent equity offering have provided us with the liquidity to reduce our overall level of net debt. Moreover, our sustained operational performance and balance sheet de-leveraging have improved our access to capital, as we continue to reward stakeholders across our entire capital structure.
 
"You can expect all of these trends to continue, as we anticipate a stable to improving lease up environment ahead. I have great confidence in this company's management teamthey are energetic, committed to driving customer satisfaction and shareholder value, and know what it takes to win."
 
Operating Highlights
 
Organic same tower revenue and same tower cash flow growth on approximately 13,200 towers owned as of the beginning of the third quarter 2002 and the end of the third quarter 2003 was 11% and 15%,
 
respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2003 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2002.
 
Rental and management segment operating profit increased 23% to $105.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003, from $85.1 million for the same period in 2002. Rental and management segment operating profit margins increased to 66.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2003, from 61.6% for the same period in 2002. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 54.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2003, from 45.0% for the same period in 2002.
 
The Company generated free cash flow of $20.6 million in the third quarter 2003, which includes a deduction of approximately $20.3 million for non-cash interest expense from the accretion of our senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 and our 2.25% discount convertible notes due 2009 and amortization of deferred financing costs (excluding the $20.3 million of non-cash interest expense would result in free cash flow of $40.9 million).
 
Asset Transactions
 
The Company made progress on strategically divesting non-core portions of its business and acquiring complementary core tower assets. During the third quarter of 2003 the Company closed on $6.6 million of divestitures including certain non-core tower assets, a non-revenue generating office building and Galaxy, its radio frequency engineering services business. The Company has adjusted its September 30, 2003 and 2002 financial statements, as well as its 2003 Outlook, to reflect Galaxy as a discontinued operation. In addition, the Company anticipates that it may receive in excess of $30 million of proceeds from the sale of additional non-core tower assets during the remainder of 2003.
 
The Company has entered into an agreement to sell a majority interest in Verestar and expects the sale to close by the end of 2003. The sale is subject to certain closing conditions, including the buyer obtaining certain concessions from Verestar's vendors, and there can be no assurance that the closing will occur.
 
As of September 30, 2003, the Company has satisfied its obligation under the NII Holdings tower acquisition for approximately $101.8 million, including approximately $34.7 million during the third quarter of 2003. The Company expects to close on an additional $12.5 million of the NII Holdings assets in stages over the next six months. This would bring the total acquisition from NII Holdings to approximately $114.3 million.
 
Financing Highlights
 
The Company strengthened its financial position during the third quarter of 2003 by increasing liquidity and reducing leverage. As previously announced, the Company issued approximately 14.3 million shares of Class A common stock for net proceeds of approximately $120.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering. The net proceeds of the equity offering will be used to repurchase outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. In addition to the equity offering, the Company received approximately $202.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of 3.25% convertible notes due 2010. Of the $202.8 million in net proceeds, $100.0 million was used to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities and $102.8 million was used to repurchase convertible notes. Please refer to the supplemental schedule on page 8 of the press release for a more complete summary of our offerings and the use of the proceeds from our restricted cash accounts.
 
The combination of increasing operating profit, proceeds from financing activities and paying down debt reduced the Company's Net Leverage Ratio ("total debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments on hand divided by third quarter 2003 annualized Adjusted EBITDA") as of September 30, 2003 to 7.8 from 10.7 for the same period in 2002.
 
As of September 30, 2003 the Company had $587.7 million in total liquidity, which is comprised of $349.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $283.7 million of restricted cash and investments, and the ability to draw upon the available $237.8 million of its revolving loan.
 
As previously announced, the Company completed a tender offer on October 22, 2003 for substantially all of the remaining $84.2 million of 2.25% convertible notes ($55,000 of 2.25% convertible notes remains outstanding).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, we have presented the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage Ratio. These measures are not intended as substitutes for other measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. They are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of our core businesses. We believe that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Additionally, interest expense may vary significantly depending on capital structure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measure of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage Ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are included on pages 11 and 12 of this release. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached on pages 5-7 of this release.
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, our revised quarterly and full year 2003 and full year 2004 Outlook, and planned future asset sales. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) continuation of the current U.S. economic slowdown, which could materially and adversely affect our business; (3) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results by restricting our ability to allocate capital to income producing assets; (4) restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior and subordinated notes could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness of our tenants; (7) if we issue a significant amount of equity securities, the trading price for our shares of Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected; (8) operations in foreign countries could lead to expropriations, government regulations, funds inaccessibility and foreign exchange exposure; (9) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues; and (10) our inability to complete our planned asset sales or realize the amount of proceeds we currently expect from such sales. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Business Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, which we incorporate herein by reference. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.
