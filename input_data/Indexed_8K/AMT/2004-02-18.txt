Jim Taiclet, American Tower's Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our solid fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate our commitment to growing revenue consistently, while tightly managing costs and capital expenditures. Our delivery of the company's first full year of positive free cash flow in 2003 establishes a strong foundation for the further pursuit of our strategy.
 
"Our strategy of focusing the company on the core rental and management business, increasing the return on our existing asset base, pursuing only high return growth opportunities to expand the core business via building or buying, and further de-leveraging our balance sheet will result in expanding free

cash flow over time. In addition, in 2004 we are redoubling our effort to drive operational excellence in our critical business processes. Our goal is to further accelerate our ability to generate new revenue while sustaining very high cash flow conversion rates.
 
"We also began 2004 with a substantially strengthened balance sheet, with our net leverage ratio down almost two full turns year over year to 7.4 times annualized Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2003, and still decreasing. We have also taken advantage of strong capital markets to lengthen maturities and greatly improve our liquidity position over the past twelve months. As we look to the future, we are encouraged by recent trends of robust subscriber and minutes-of-use growth, the introduction of advanced wireless networks, and the need for improved wireless network quality especially as driven by wireless and wireline number portability."
 
Operating Highlights
 
The following same tower metrics presented for the three months and full year ended December 31, have been adjusted to exclude approximately $4 million in 2002 in non-recurring positive items to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. Organic same tower revenue and same tower cash flow growth on the approximately 13,300 towers owned as of the beginning of the fourth quarter 2002 and the end of the fourth quarter 2003 was 10% and 14%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2002.
 
Rental and management segment operating profit increased 15% to $109.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003, from $95.5 million for the same period in 2002. Rental and management segment operating profit margins increased to 67% for the three months ended December 31, 2003, from 64% for the same period in 2002.
 
Rental and management segment operating profit increased 24% to $411.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2003, from $332.1 million for the same period in 2002. Rental and management segment operating profit margins increased to 66% for the full year ended December 31, 2003, from 61% for the same period in 2002.
 
Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense for the fourth quarter 2004 was $12.3 million and includes approximately $8.9 million of non-cash impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets, approximately $2.0 million of restructuring expense related to reorganizing certain operational functions within the rental and management group, and approximately $1.4 million in cash charges related to retirement compensation paid to Steven B. Dodge in connection with his retirement as Chief Executive Officer.
 
Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow ("Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense and capital expenditures incurred, excluding acquisitions and divestitures") was $20.5 million and $61.5 million, respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2003. These free cash flow numbers include deductions of approximately $19.9 million and $75.6 million, respectively, for non-cash interest expense relating to the accretion of our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008, our 2.25% discount convertible notes due 2009, and to the amortization of deferred financing costs (excluding the $19.9 million and $75.6 million would result in free cash flow of $40.4 million and $137.1 million, respectively).
 
Asset Transactions
 
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company continued to execute its strategy of divesting non-core portions of its business and acquiring complementary core tower assets.
 
The Company closed on $33.7 million of divestitures, including 206 non-strategic towers. The towers sold contributed approximately $5.1 million of annual revenue and $3.4 million in annual cash flow. In addition, the Company may receive approximately $10.5 million of proceeds from the sale of additional
 
Page 3 of 14
 
tower assets in the first quarter 2004, representing approximately $1.5 million of annual revenue and $1.0 million in annual cash flow.
 
As of September 30, 2003, the Company had satisfied its $100 million minimum purchase obligation under the NII Holdings acquisition agreement. During the fourth quarter 2003 the Company closed on an additional 69 towers for $10.6 million bringing to 665 the aggregate number of towers acquired from NII Holdings for a total purchase price of $112.4 million as of December 31, 2003. The Company may acquire additional tower assets from NII Holdings in 2004, and currently expects to acquire an additional 24 towers in the second quarter 2004 for approximately $4.4 million.
 
In the fourth quarter 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase up to 143 towers from Iusacell Celular in Mexico for up to $31.4 million. During the fourth quarter, the Company closed on 34 of these towers for approximately $8.5 million, and the remaining closings are expected to occur by the end of the third quarter 2004. The Company also agreed to acquire approximately 80 domestic towers for approximately $4.1 million, which are expected to close in the first quarter of 2004.
 
At the completion of the remaining $31.4 million of NII Holdings, Iusacell and domestic tower acquisitions the Company anticipates incremental total annual revenues of $5.5 million and incremental total annual cash flow of $3.6 million.
 
Financing Highlights
 
The Company has continued to strengthen its financial position through a combination of strong operational execution and thoughtfully accessing the capital markets.
 
As previously announced, in the fourth quarter 2003 American Towers, Inc., the Company's principal operating subsidiary, sold $400.0 million principal amount of its 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of approximately $389.3 million were used to prepay indebtedness under the Company's credit facilities. The Company also completed a tender offer on October 22, 2003 for substantially all of the remaining $84.2 million of its 2.25% convertible notes ($44,000 of 2.25% convertible notes remains outstanding).
 
In February 2004, the Company completed an institutional private placement of $225.0 million principal amount of its 7.50% senior notes due 2012. The net proceeds of approximately $221.7 million will be used to redeem all of the Company's outstanding 6.25% convertible notes due 2009 (which may be put to the Company by investors in 2006) and a portion of the Company's other outstanding notes.
 
In addition, in February 2004, the Company refinanced its $267.0 million Term Loan B with a new $267.0 million Term Loan C. Term Loan C has substantially the same terms as Term Loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for LIBOR and Base Rate loans were reduced by 125 basis points, from 350 to 225 and from 250 to 125, respectively.
 
The combination of increasing operating profit, proceeds from financial and strategic activities and paying down debt reduced the Company's Net Leverage Ratio ("total debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments on hand divided by fourth quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA") as of December 31, 2003 to 7.4 from 9.2 for the same period in 2002.
 
As of December 31, 2003 the Company had $544.8 million in total liquidity, which is comprised of $275.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $170.0 million of restricted cash and investments, and the ability to draw upon the available $269.3 million of its Revolving Loan.
 
ATC Mexico Holding Corp.
 
As disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the right of J. Michael Gearon, Jr., President of American Tower International, to require the Company to purchase his 8.7% interest in ATC Mexico Holding Corp., the subsidiary through which the Company conducts its Mexico operations ("ATC Mexico"), became exercisable in January 2003. In January 2004, Mr. Gearon exercised this right. The purchase price for Mr. Gearon's interest in ATC Mexico is subject to review by
 
Page 4 of 14
 
an independent financial advisor, and is payable in cash or shares of the Company's Class A common stock, at the Company's option. The Company intends to pay the purchase price in shares of its Class A common stock, and closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2004. In addition, the Company expects that payment of a portion of the purchase price will be contingent upon ATC Mexico meeting certain performance objectives. The Company does not expect that there will be any change in Mr. Gearon's role as President of American Tower International.
 
Changes in Composition of Board of Directors
 
On February 13, 2004, the Board of Directors named James D. Taiclet, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Directors to replace Steven B. Dodge, who retired from the Board effective the same date. Mr. Taiclet also will continue to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Board appointed Carolyn Katz to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Arnold Chavkin in early 2004. Ms. Katz has nearly twenty years experience in emerging and high growth telecommunications and technology companies worldwide. She was formerly a managing director at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and a principal at Providence Equity Partners.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, we have presented the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage Ratio. These measures are not intended as substitutes for other measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. They are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of our core businesses. We believe that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Additionally, interest expense may vary significantly depending on capital structure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measure of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage Ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are included on pages 12-14 of this release. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached on pages 6-8 of this release.
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, our full year 2004 Outlook, and planned future asset acquisitions and sales. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) continuation of the current U.S. economic slowdown could materially and adversely affect our business; (3) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results by restricting our ability to allocate capital to income producing assets; (4) restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and our senior and subordinated notes could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness of our tenants; (7) operations in foreign countries could lead to expropriations, government regulations, funds inaccessibility and foreign exchange exposure; (8) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues; (9) we may not be able to complete our planned asset sales or realize the amount of proceeds we currently expect from such sales; and (10) the bankruptcy proceeding of our Verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Business Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, which we incorporate herein by reference. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.
