Item 5.    Other Events
 
On January 20, 2004, we announced that Steven B. Dodge, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, had notified the Company that he intended to convert all of the shares of our Class B common stock held by him and his affiliates into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis in connection with his retirement from our Board of Directors. Mr. Dodge retired from our Board of Directors on February 13, 2004, and he has elected to effect this conversion. Shares of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and shares of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Pursuant to the terms of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation ("Charter"), Mr. Dodge's election has triggered the Dodge Conversion Event (as defined in our Charter). Accordingly, upon completion of this conversion, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock automatically will be converted into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and the Company will no longer have any shares of Class B common stock outstanding. Our Charter prohibits any future issuances of Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 212.1 million shares of Class A common stock and 7.0 million shares of Class B common stock were outstanding (of the outstanding Class B common stock, Mr. Dodge and certain related parties held approximately 5.7 million shares). Giving effect to the conversion, as of December 31, 2003, the Company would have outstanding approximately 219.1 million shares of Class A common stock and Mr. Dodge and his affiliates would control less than 5% of the voting power represented thereby.
