On May 25, 2004, American Tower Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that its operating subsidiaries had successfully refinanced the Company's previous credit facility with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility, consisting of a $400 million revolving credit facility, a $300 million Term Loan A and a $400 million Term Loan B. The new credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries and is secured by a pledge of substantially all of the Company's assets.
 
At closing, the Company received approximately $685 million of net proceeds from borrowings under the new facility, after deducting related expenses and fees. Approximately $670 million of the net proceeds were used to repay principal and interest on the outstanding borrowings under the Company's previous credit facility. The Company plans to use the remaining approximately $15 million of net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including refinancing other existing indebtedness. At closing, the Company had approximately $373 million of availability under the revolving loan facility, net of undrawn letters of credit of approximately $27 million.
 
Among other changes, the new facility extends the maturity dates from 2007 to 2011 for a majority of the borrowings outstanding under the new credit facility, subject to the conditions described below, and permits the Company to use borrowings under the new facility and internally generated funds to repurchase other indebtedness without seeking approval from the lenders under the new facility.
 
The table below shows the principal amortization schedule under the new credit facility for the outstanding Term Loan A and Term Loan B:
 
 
A final payment of all outstanding revolving loans is due in 2011.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term Loan A and any outstanding revolving loans will mature on August 15, 2008 and the Term Loan B will mature on October 31, 2008 if (1) on or prior to August 1, 2008, the Company's 9 3/8% Senior Notes have not been (a) refinanced with indebtedness of the Company having a maturity date of February 28, 2012 or later or with loans under the new credit facilities, or (b) repaid, prepaid, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise retired; (2) the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (Total Parent Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow) at June 30, 2008 exceeds 4.50 to 1.00. If this were to occur, the payments due in 2008 for Term Loan A and Term Loan B would be $225.0 million and $386.0 million, respectively.
and
 
The new credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, use of proceeds from asset sales, dividends and distributions, investments and liens) with which the Company's borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. The new credit facilities contain four financial maintenance tests with which the Company must comply:
 
 
 
 
 
Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent the Company from being able to borrow additional funds under its revolving line of credit, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict the Company's ability, as the parent company, to incur any debt other than that currently outstanding, certain refinancings of that debt and outstanding debt of our subsidiaries and certain other exceptions. The credit facilities also limit the Company's revolving loan drawdowns based on its cash on hand.
 
As a result of the closing of the new credit facility, the Company may be required to write-off deferred financing fees of up to approximately $12 million associated with its previous credit facilities that have been refinanced.
 
The foregoing is only a summary of certain provisions of the new facility and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the new credit facility. Copies of the press release and the new credit facility are filed herewith as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent the provisions of this Article shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.

LIBOR Basis Determination Inadequate or Unfair
 
Section 10.2 . If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable Law (whether adopted before or after the Agreement Date), or any change in interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund its portion of LIBOR Advances, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrowers. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 10.2, such Lender shall designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the
Illegality
 
need for giving such notice and will not, in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Upon receipt of such notice, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 2 hereof, the Borrowers shall repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of such Lender's portion of each affected LIBOR Advance, together with accrued interest thereon, on either (a) the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such affected LIBOR Advances if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund its portion of such LIBOR Advance to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain its portion of such affected LIBOR Advances to such day. Concurrently with repaying such portion of each affected LIBOR Advance, the Borrowers may borrow a Base Rate Advance from such Lender, whether or not it would have been entitled to effect such borrowing, and such Lender shall make such Advance, if so requested, in an amount such that the outstanding principal amount of the affected Note held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding principal amount of such Note immediately prior to such repayment.
 
Section 10.3 .
Increased Costs and Additional Amounts
 
(a) If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable Law (whether adopted before or after the Agreement Date), or any interpretation or change in interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any directive issued after the Agreement Date (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:
 
(i) shall subject any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its obligation to make its portion of LIBOR Advances, or its portion of other Advances, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on its portion of LIBOR Advances or in respect of any other amounts due under this Agreement, or its obligation to make its portion of Advances (except for changes in the rate or method of calculation of tax on the revenues or net income of such Lender, and except for any Taxes referred to in Section 10.3(b) hereof); or
 
(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding any included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage), special deposit, capital adequacy, assessment or other requirement or condition against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or commitments or credit extended by, any Lender or shall impose on any Lender or the London interbank borrowing market any other condition affecting its obligation to make its portion of such LIBOR Advances or its portion of existing Advances;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any of its portion of LIBOR Advances, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, then,
 
within ten (10) days after demand by such Lender, the Borrowers agree to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender on an after-tax basis for such increased costs.
 
(b) All payments made by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income or other similar taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings (""), now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any governmental authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Lender as a result of present or former connection between such Person and the jurisdiction of the governmental authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from such Person having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded Taxes (collectively, the "") are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to such Person shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Person (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest on any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement; , , that the Borrowers shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof if such Person fails to comply with the requirements of Section 2.13 hereof. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrowers, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrowers shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrowers showing payment thereof. If the Borrowers fail to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other documentary evidence, the Borrowers shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as result of any such failure. The Borrowers shall make any payments required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of written demand therefor from the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be. The agreements set forth in this Section 10.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations. Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 10.3 and will designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole reasonable judgment of such Lender made in good faith, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Borrowers shall have no obligation to pay to any Lender any amount which the Borrowers are liable to withhold due to the failure of such Lender to file any statement of exemption required under the Code in order to permit the Borrowers to make payments to such Lender without such withholding.
Taxes
Non-Excluded Taxes

(c) Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 10.3 shall provide the Borrowers with a written certificate setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder and calculations therefor in reasonable detail. Such certificate shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use
 
any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. If any Lender demands compensation under this Section 10.3, the Borrowers may at any time, upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior notice to such Lender, prepay in full such Lender's portion of the then outstanding LIBOR Advances, together with accrued interest and fees thereon to the date of prepayment, along with any reimbursement required under Section 2.10 hereof and this Section 10.3. Concurrently with prepaying such portion of LIBOR Advances the Borrowers may, whether or not then entitled to make such borrowing, borrow a Base Rate Advance, or a LIBOR Advance not so affected, from such Lender, and such Lender shall, if so requested, make such Advance in an amount such that the outstanding principal amount of the affected Note or Notes held by such Lender shall equal the outstanding principal amount of such Note or Notes immediately prior to such prepayment.
 
Section 10.4 . If notice has been given pursuant to Section 10.1, 10.2 or 10.3 hereof suspending the obligation of any Lender to make its portion of any type of LIBOR Advance, or requiring such Lender's portion of LIBOR Advances to be repaid or prepaid, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such repayment no longer apply, all amounts which would otherwise be made by such Lender as its portion of LIBOR Advances shall be instead as Base Rate Advances, unless otherwise notified by any of the Borrowers.

Section 11.3 .

No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders, the Super Majority Lenders, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, or any of them, in exercising any right, shall operate as a waiver of such right. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 11.12, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "") sponsored by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement; that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Advance and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof. The Loans by an SPC hereunder shall be Revolving Loans, Term Loan A Loans, Term Loan B Loans and/or, if applicable, Incremental Facility Loans of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loans were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it, solely in its capacity as a party hereto and to any other Loan Document, will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 11.5, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Advances to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Advances and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Advances to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This Section 11.5(j) may not be amended without the written consent of any SPC which has been designated in writing as provided in the first sentence hereof and holds any outstanding Loans. The designation by a Granting Lender of an SPC to fund Advances (i) shall be deemed to be a representation, warranty, covenant and agreement by such Granting Lender to the Borrowers and all other parties hereunder that (A) the funding and maintaining of such Advances by such SPC shall not constitute a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 4.1(m) hereof), and (B) such designation, funding and maintenance would not result in any interest requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification under any state securities law, and shall from time to time provide to the Borrowers the tax and other forms required pursuant to Section 2.09(e) hereof with respect to such SPC as though such SPC were a Lender hereunder. In no event shall the Borrowers or any Lender other than the Granting Lender be obligated hereunder to pay any additional amounts under any provision of this Agreement (pursuant to Article 10 hereof or otherwise) by reason of a Granting Lender's designation of an SPC or the funding or maintenance of Advances by such SPC, in excess of amounts which the Borrowers would have been obligated to pay if such Granting Lender had not made such designation and such Granting Lender were itself funding and maintaining such Advances.

If, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the quarterly or annual financial statements referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the Majority Lenders shall object in writing to the Borrowers' determining compliance hereunder on such basis, (1) calculations for the purposes of determining compliance hereunder shall be made on a basis consistent with those used in the preparation of the latest financial statements as to which such objection shall not have been made, or (2) if requested by the Borrowers, the Majority Lenders will negotiate in good faith to amend the covenants herein to give effect to the changes in GAAP in a manner consistent with this Agreement (and so long as the Borrowers comply in good faith with the provisions of this Section 11.6, no Default or Event of Default shall occur hereunder solely as a result of such changes in GAAP).

Warranty
which constitutes the percentage of the issued and outstanding ownership interests of the Subsidiaries as set forth on attached hereto, free and clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens), (b) the shares of Capital Stock pledged hereunder are duly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and (c) the Pledgor has the unencumbered right to pledge the Ownership Interests.

The Pledgor has delivered to the Administrative Agent all of its right, title and interest in and to the Ownership Interests, together with certificates with respect to Certificated Ownership Interests, and undated stock powers endorsed in blank with respect to Certificated Ownership Interests, as security for the Secured Obligations; it being the intention of the parties hereto that beneficial ownership of the Ownership Interests, including, without limitation, all voting, consensual and dividend rights, shall remain in the Pledgor until the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under the terms of the Loan Agreement and until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Pledgor of the Administrative Agent's exercise of voting and dividend rights to the Ownership Interests pursuant to Section 9 hereof.
Security Interest
 
3. . In the event that, during the term of this Agreement:
Additional Ownership Interests
 
(a) any stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, readjustment, or other change is declared or made in the capital structure of any Subsidiary of the Pledgor, or any new ownership interests are issued by such Subsidiary of the Pledgor, or any new Subsidiary of the Pledgor is formed or acquired, all new, substituted, and additional ownership interests shall be issued to the Pledgor and shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated stock powers endorsed in blank by the Pledgor with respect to Certificated Ownership Interests, and shall thereupon constitute Ownership Interests to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement; and
 
(b) any subscriptions, warrants or any other rights or options shall be issued in connection with the Ownership Interests consisting of shares of Capital Stock, all new stock or other securities acquired through such subscriptions, warrants, rights or options by the Pledgor shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated stock powers endorsed in blank, and shall thereupon constitute Ownership Interests to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement.
 
4. . In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as any such Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Ownership Interests at a public or private sale or make other commercially reasonable disposition of the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof after fifteen (15) days' notice to the Pledgor, and the Secured Parties, or any of them, may purchase the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof at any public sale. The proceeds of the public or private sale or other disposition shall be applied first to the costs of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the sale, expressly including, without limitation, any costs under Section 7 hereof, and then to the Secured Obligations as provided in the Loan Agreement. In the event the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the Ownership Interests are insufficient to satisfy the Secured Obligations, the Pledgor shall remain liable for any such deficiency. The Pledgor waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the rights of equity of redemption, appraisal, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand and marshalling, to the extent applicable.
Default
 
5. . In addition to its rights and privileges under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, shall have all the rights, powers and privileges of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction and other Applicable Law.
Additional Rights of Secured Party
 
6. . Upon indefeasible payment in full of all principal and interest on the Notes, full performance by the Borrowers of all Obligations under the Loan Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents, and satisfaction in full of any other Secured Obligations, other than the Secured Obligations which survive the termination of the Loan Agreement as provided in Section 11.16 of the Loan Agreement, and after such time as the Lenders shall have no obligation to make any further Advances to the Borrowers, this Agreement shall terminate and the Administrative Agent shall return the remaining Ownership Interests and all rights received by the Administrative Agent as a result of its possessory interest in the Ownership Interests to the Pledgor.
Return of Ownership Interests to the Pledgor
 
7. . The Ownership Interests are not registered or qualified under the various federal or state securities laws of the United States and disposition thereof after an Event of Default may be restricted to one or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such registration. The Pledgor understands that upon such disposition, the Administrative Agent may approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further understands that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Ownership Interests than if the Ownership Interests were registered and qualified pursuant to federal and state securities laws and sold on the open market. The Pledgor, therefore, agrees that:
Disposition of Ownership Interests by Administrative Agent
 
(a) if the Administrative Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, sell or cause the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof to be sold at a private sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of any national brokerage or investment firm having recognized expertise and experience in connection with shares of communications tower companies (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial reasonableness of such action) as to the best manner in which to dispose of the Ownership Interests for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable at the private sale thereof; and
 
(b) that such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that the Administrative Agent has handled such disposition in a commercially reasonable manner absent manifest error.
 
8. . The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against the Pledgor or any other Person, nor against other security or liens available to any Secured Party. The Pledgor hereby waives any right to require that an action be brought against any other Person or to require that resort be had to any other security or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any of the Secured Parties in favor of any other Person prior to the exercise of remedies hereunder, or to require action hereunder prior to resort by the Administrative Agent to any other security or collateral for the Secured Obligations. No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor with respect to the Secured Obligations to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Pledgor, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral or any other collateral or guaranty to the Pledgor by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof, nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Secured Obligation hereunder, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Secured Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Secured Obligations. None of the Secured Parties shall, by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion.
Pledgor's Obligations Absolute
 
9. .
Voting Rights
 
(a) For so long as any Secured Obligations remain unpaid, after and during the continuation of an Event of Default, but subject to the provisions of Section 15 hereof, (i) the Administrative Agent may, upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to the Pledgor of its intention to do so, exercise all voting rights, and all other ownership or consensual rights of the Ownership Interests, but under no circumstances is the Administrative Agent obligated by the terms of this Agreement to exercise such rights, and (ii) the Pledgor hereby appoints the
 
Administrative Agent, which appointment shall be effective on the fifteenth (15th) day following the giving of notice by the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 9(a)(i) hereof, the Pledgor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and IRREVOCABLE PROXY to vote the Ownership Interests in any manner the Administrative Agent deems advisable for or against all matters submitted or which may be submitted to a vote of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be. The power-of-attorney granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.
 
(b) For so long as the Pledgor shall have the right to vote the Ownership Interests, the Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, vote or take any consensual action with respect to the Ownership Interests which would constitute an Event of Default.
 
10. . No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Pledgor, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Pledgor or any other collateral or guaranty by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Secured Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Secured Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Secured Obligations and termination of the Commitments. None of the Secured Parties shall by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent or one or more of the Secured Parties in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion.

Additional Ownership Interests

102 of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York), shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated stock powers endorsed in blank by the Pledgor with respect to any such Certificated Ownership Interests, and shall thereupon constitute Ownership Interests to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement; and

4. Default. In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as any such Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Ownership Interests at a public or private sale or make other commercially reasonable disposition of the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof after fifteen (15) days' notice to the Pledgor and the Secured Parties, or any of them, may purchase the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof at any public sale. The proceeds of the public or private sale or other disposition shall be applied first to the costs of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the sale, expressly including, without limitation, any costs under Section 7 hereof, and then as provided in the Loan Agreement.

Upon indefeasible payment in full of all principal and interest on the Notes, full performance by the Borrowers of all Obligations under the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and satisfaction in full of any other Guarantied Obligations, other than the Guarantied Obligations which survive the termination of the Loan Agreement as provided in Section 11.16 of the Loan Agreement, and after such time as the Lenders shall have no obligation to make any further Advances to the Borrowers, this Agreement shall terminate and the Administrative Agent shall return the remaining Ownership Interests and all rights received by the Administrative Agent as a result of its possessory interest in the Ownership Interests to the Pledgor.
Return of Ownership Interests to the Pledgor
 
7. . The Ownership Interests are not registered or qualified under the various federal or state securities laws of the United States and disposition thereof after an Event of Default may be restricted to one or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such registration. The Pledgor understands
Disposition of Ownership Interests by Administrative Agent
 
that upon such disposition, the Administrative Agent may approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further understands that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Ownership Interests than if the Ownership Interests were registered and qualified pursuant to federal and state securities laws and sold on the open market. The Pledgor, therefore, agrees that:
 
(a) if the Administrative Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, sell or cause the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof to be sold at a private sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of any national brokerage or investment firm having recognized expertise and experience in connection with shares of communications tower companies (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial reasonableness of such action) as to the best manner in which to dispose of the Ownership Interests for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable at the private sale thereof; and
 
(b) that such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that the Administrative Agent has handled such disposition in a commercially reasonable manner absent manifest error.
 
8. . The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against the Borrowers or any other Person, nor against other security or liens available to any Secured Party. The Pledgor hereby waives any right to require that an action be brought against any other Person or to require that resort be had to any other security or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any of the Secured Parties in favor of any other Person prior to the exercise of remedies hereunder, or to require action hereunder prior to resort by the Administrative Agent to any other security or collateral for the Guarantied Obligations. No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor with respect to the Guarantied Obligations to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Borrowers, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Borrowers or any other Person or any other collateral or guaranty to the Borrowers or any other Person by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof, nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Guarantied Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Guarantied Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Guarantied Obligations. None of the Secured Parties shall, by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion.
Pledgor's Obligations Absolute
 
9. .
Voting Rights
 
(a) For so long as any Guarantied Obligations remain unpaid, after and during the continuation of an Event of Default, (i) the Administrative Agent may, upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to the Pledgor of its intention to do so, exercise all voting rights, and all other ownership or consensual rights of the Ownership Interests, but under no circumstances is the Administrative Agent obligated by the terms of this Agreement to exercise such rights, and (ii) the Pledgor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent, which appointment shall be effective on the fifteenth (15th) day following the giving of notice by the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 9(a)(i) hereof, the Pledgor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and IRREVOCABLE PROXY to vote the Ownership Interests in any manner the Administrative Agent deems advisable for or against all matters submitted or which may be submitted to a vote of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be. The power-of-attorney granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.
 
(b) For so long as the Pledgor shall have the right to vote the Ownership Interests, the Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, vote or take any consensual action with respect to the Ownership Interests which would constitute an Event of Default.
 
10. . No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Pledgor, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Pledgor or any other collateral or guaranty by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Guarantied Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Guarantied Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Guarantied Obligations and termination of the Commitments. None of the Secured Parties shall by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent or one or more of the Secured Parties in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion.

Schedule 2
 
2. . The Pledgor hereby unconditionally grants and assigns to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, a continuing security interest in and security title to the Ownership Interests in any Subsidiary of the Pledgor obtained in the future, and in each case, all certificates representing such shares or other ownership interests, all rights, options, warrants, stock or other securities or other property which may hereafter be received, receivable or distributed in respect of the Ownership Interests, together with all proceeds of the foregoing, including, without limitation, all dividends, cash, notes, securities or other property from time to time acquired, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, the foregoing, all of which shall constitute "Ownership Interests" hereunder. The Pledgor has delivered to the Administrative Agent herewith all of its right, title and interest in and to the Ownership Interests, together with certificates with respect to Certificated Ownership Interests, and undated stock powers endorsed in blank with respect to Certificated Ownership Interests, as security for the payment of all of the Guarantied Obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement and the Guaranty and any extensions, renewals or amendments of any of the foregoing, however created, acquired, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due; it being the intention of the parties hereto that beneficial ownership of the Ownership Interests, including, without limitation, all voting, consensual and dividend rights, shall remain in the Pledgor until the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under the terms of the Loan Agreement and until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Pledgor of the Administrative Agent's exercise of voting and dividend rights to the Ownership Interests pursuant to Section 9 hereof.
Security Interest
 
3. . In the event that, during the term of this Agreement:
Additional Ownership Interests
 
(a) any stock dividend, stock split, reclassification, readjustment, or other change is declared or made in the capital structure of any Subsidiary of the Pledgor, or any new ownership interests are issued by such Subsidiary of the Pledgor, or any new Subsidiary of the Pledgor is formed or acquired, all new, substituted, and additional ownership interests shall be issued to the Pledgor and shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated stock powers endorsed in blank by the Pledgor with respect to Certificated Ownership
 
Interests, and shall thereupon constitute Ownership Interests to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement; and
 
(b) any subscriptions, warrants or any other rights or options shall be issued in connection with the Ownership Interests consisting of shares of Capital Stock, all new stock or other securities acquired through such subscriptions, warrants, rights or options by the Pledgor shall be promptly delivered to the Administrative Agent, together with undated stock powers endorsed in blank, and shall thereupon constitute Ownership Interests to be held by the Administrative Agent under the terms of this Agreement.
 
4. . In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default and so long as any such Event of Default is continuing, the Administrative Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Ownership Interests at a public or private sale or make other commercially reasonable disposition of the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof after fifteen (15) days' notice to the Pledgor and the Secured Parties, or any of them, may purchase the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof at any public sale. The proceeds of the public or private sale or other disposition shall be applied first to the costs of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the sale, expressly including, without limitation, any costs under Section 7 hereof, and then as provided in the Loan Agreement. In the event the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the Ownership Interests are insufficient to satisfy the Guarantied Obligations, the Pledgor shall remain liable for any such deficiency to the extent provided in the Guaranty. The Pledgor waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the rights of equity of redemption, appraisal, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand and marshalling, to the extent applicable.
Default
 
5. . In addition to its rights and privileges under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, shall have all the rights, powers and privileges of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction and other Applicable Law.
Additional Rights of Secured Party
 
6. . Upon indefeasible payment in full of all principal and interest on the Notes, full performance by the Borrowers of all Obligations under the Loan Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, and satisfaction in full of any other Guarantied Obligations, other than the Guarantied Obligations which survive the termination of the Loan Agreement as provided in Section 11.16 of the Loan Agreement, and after such time as the Lenders shall have no obligation to make any further Advances to the Borrowers, this Agreement shall terminate and the Administrative Agent shall return the remaining Ownership Interests and all rights received by the Administrative Agent as a result of its possessory interest in the Ownership Interests to the Pledgor.
Return of Ownership Interests to the Pledgor
 
7. . The Ownership Interests are not registered or qualified under the various federal or state securities laws of the United States and disposition thereof after an Event of Default may be restricted to one or more private (instead of public) sales in view of the lack of such registration. The Pledgor understands that upon such disposition, the Administrative Agent may approach only a restricted number of potential purchasers and further understands that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Ownership Interests than if the Ownership Interests were registered and
Disposition of Ownership Interests by Administrative Agent
 
qualified pursuant to federal and state securities laws and sold on the open market. The Pledgor, therefore, agrees that:
 
(a) if the Administrative Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, sell or cause the Ownership Interests or any portion thereof to be sold at a private sale, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of any national brokerage or investment firm having recognized expertise and experience in connection with shares of communications tower companies (but shall not be obligated to seek such advice and the failure to do so shall not be considered in determining the commercial reasonableness of such action) as to the best manner in which to dispose of the Ownership Interests for sale and as to the best price reasonably obtainable at the private sale thereof; and
 
(b) that such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that the Administrative Agent has handled such disposition in a commercially reasonable manner absent manifest error.
 
8. . The obligations of the Pledgor under this Agreement shall be direct and immediate and not conditional or contingent upon the pursuit of any remedies against the Borrowers or any other Person, nor against other security or liens available to any Secured Party. The Pledgor hereby waives any right to require that an action be brought against any other Person or to require that resort be had to any other security or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any of the Secured Parties in favor of any other Person prior to the exercise of remedies hereunder, or to require action hereunder prior to resort by the Administrative Agent to any other security or collateral for the Guarantied Obligations. No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor with respect to the Guarantied Obligations to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Borrowers, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Borrowers or any other Person or any other collateral or guaranty by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof, nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Guarantied Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Guarantied Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Guarantied Obligations. None of the Secured Parties shall, by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion.
Pledgor's Obligations Absolute
 
9. .
Voting Rights
 
(a) For so long as any Guarantied Obligations remain unpaid, after and during the continuation of an Event of Default, but subject to the provisions of Section 15 hereof, (i) the Administrative Agent may, upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to the Pledgor of its
 
intention to do so, exercise all voting rights, and all other ownership or consensual rights of the Ownership Interests, but under no circumstances is the Administrative Agent obligated by the terms of this Agreement to exercise such rights, and (ii) the Pledgor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent, which appointment shall be effective on the fifteenth (15th) day following the giving of notice by the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 9(a)(i) hereof, the Pledgor's true and lawful attorney-in-fact and IRREVOCABLE PROXY to vote the Ownership Interests in any manner the Administrative Agent deems advisable for or against all matters submitted or which may be submitted to a vote of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be. The power-of-attorney granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable.
 
(b) For so long as the Pledgor shall have the right to vote the Ownership Interests, the Pledgor covenants and agrees that it will not, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, vote or take any consensual action with respect to the Ownership Interests which would constitute an Event of Default.
 
10. . No amendment, modification, waiver, transfer or renewal, extension, assignment or termination of this Agreement or of the Loan Agreement or of any other Loan Document, or of any instrument or document executed and delivered by the Pledgor or any other obligor to the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor additional advances made by the Secured Parties, or any of them, to the Pledgor, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery or release of the Collateral to the Pledgor or any other collateral or guaranty by the Secured Parties, or any of them, nor any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any term thereof nor any other act of the Secured Parties, or any of them, shall release the Pledgor from any Guarantied Obligation, except a release or discharge executed in writing by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the Loan Agreement with respect to such Guarantied Obligation or upon full payment and satisfaction of all Guarantied Obligations and termination of the Commitments. None of the Secured Parties shall by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its or their rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent or one or more of the Secured Parties in accordance with the Loan Agreement and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by the Secured Parties, or any of them, of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which any such Person would otherwise have had on any other occasion.

11. . The Pledgor hereby agrees that this Agreement or the rights hereunder may, in the discretion of the Secured Parties, or any of them, as applicable, be assigned by the Secured Parties, or any of them, in whole or in part in connection with any assignment of the Loan Agreement or the Obligations arising thereunder, as permitted thereunder.

Notification of Account Debtors
 
11. . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, the Administrative Agent or its designee may proceed to perform any and all of the obligations of the Subsidiary contained in any of the Contracts, Other Contracts or Leases and exercise any and all rights of the Subsidiary therein contained as fully as the Subsidiary itself could. The Subsidiary hereby appoints the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution, to take such action, execute such documents, and perform such work after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, as the Administrative Agent may deem appropriate in exercise of the rights and remedies granted the Secured Parties, or any of them, herein or in any other Loan Document following written notice to the Subsidiary.

12. . Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, should the Subsidiary fail to perform or observe any covenant or comply with any condition contained in any of the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases, then following written notice to the Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent may, but without obligation to do so and without releasing the Subsidiary from its obligation to do so, perform such covenant or condition and, to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall incur any reasonable costs or pay any expenses in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any reasonable costs or expenses of litigation associated therewith, such costs, expenses or payments shall be included in the Guarantied Obligations secured hereby and shall bear interest from the payment of such costs or expenses by the Administrative Agent at the Default Rate. None of the Secured Parties shall be obliged to perform or discharge any obligation of the Subsidiary under any of the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases, and, except as may result from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person seeking indemnification, the Subsidiary agrees to indemnify and hold each Secured Party harmless against any and all liability, loss or damage which any such Person may incur under any of the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases or under or by reason of this Agreement, and any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be asserted against the Subsidiary by reason of an act of any Secured Party under any of the terms of this Agreement or under the Contracts, the Other Contracts or the Leases.

The Subsidiary further authorizes the Administrative Agent, effective upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuation thereof, to compromise and settle or to sell, assign or transfer or to ask, collect, receive or issue any and all claims possessed by the Subsidiary which constitute a portion of the Collateral, all in the name of the Subsidiary. After deducting all reasonable expenses and charges (including, without limitation, the Administrative Agent's attorneys' fees) of retaking, keeping, storing and selling the Collateral, the Administrative Agent may apply the proceeds in payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations in the order of application set forth in the Loan Agreement. The power of attorney granted herein is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. The Subsidiary agrees that a failure to so notify the Administrative Agent shall be a waiver and bar to any subsequent claim for any such property. The Subsidiary agrees that if steps are taken by the Administrative Agent to enforce its rights hereunder, or to realize upon any of the Collateral, the Subsidiary shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount of the Administrative Agent's reasonable costs, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, and the Subsidiary's obligation to pay such amounts shall be deemed to be a part of the Guarantied Obligations secured hereunder. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Subsidiary shall segregate all proceeds of any Collateral from other assets of the Subsidiary.
