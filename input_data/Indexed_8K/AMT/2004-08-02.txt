Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004 includes a $31.4 million pre-tax loss on retirement of long-term obligations related to the refinancing of the Company's credit facility and the repurchase of debt securities described below. Net loss decreased to $60.5 million, or $(0.27) per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from $107.7 million, or $(0.53) per share, for the same period in 2003.
Boston, Massachusetts  August 2, 2004
 
Adjusted EBITDA ("income from operations before depreciation, amortization and accretion and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense, plus interest income, TV Azteca, net") increased 15% to $110.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from $96.1 million for the same period in 2003.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $73.7 million during the second quarter of 2004, compared to $43.5 million for the same period in 2003. Payments for purchase of property and equipment and construction activities during the second quarter of 2004 decreased to $7.8 million from $13.9 million for the same period in 2003.
 
Jim Taiclet, American Tower's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated "The healthy growth and strong fundamentals of the wireless industry continue to drive demand on our tower portfolio. Our core leasing business delivered another quarter of consistent performance with revenues increasing 10% and operating profit increasing 14% from 2003. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustained revenue growth as wireless carriers strive to improve the competitiveness of their networks. To best serve the growing needs of our customers, everyone at American Tower is focused on the fundamentals of operational execution: speed, responsiveness, and consistent quality. Our goal is to derive every possible dollar of value from our rich set of tower assets, further increasing our market share of new business and our tower operating margins.
 
"Consistent with our financial goals of strengthening our financial position and reducing our cost of capital, we successfully completed a new $1.1 billion credit facility during the quarter. The new credit facility significantly increases our financial flexibility by extending over $550 million in maturities to 2008 and beyond while enabling us to reduce our interest cost by repurchasing higher cost debt with our cash on hand, funds generated from operations and our $400 million revolving loan. Subsequent to the closing of our credit facility, we have had substantial initial progress by repurchasing over $200 million face amount

of our higher cost securities, eliminating approximately $18 million in annual interest expense. Looking to the future, we are committed to continuing our progress by further reducing interest expense and focusing on financial and strategic opportunities which will strengthen our overall financial position."
 
Operating Highlights
 
Organic same tower revenue and same tower cash flow growth on the approximately 13,400 towers owned as of the beginning of the second quarter 2003 and the end of the second quarter 2004 were 9% and 11%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2004, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2003.
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2004, rental and management segment revenues increased 10% to $167.6 million from $151.9 million, and rental and management segment operating profit increased 14% to $115.7 million from $101.2 million, for the same period in 2003. Rental and management segment operating profit margins increased to 69% for the three months ended June 30, 2004, from 67% for the same period in 2003.
 
Free cash flow ("Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense and payments for purchase of property and equipment and construction activities") was $34.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004 as compared to $11.1 million for the same period in 2003. The 2004 free cash flow includes deductions of approximately $20.1 million for non-cash interest expense relating to the accretion of our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and amortization of deferred financing fees (excluding the $20.1 million would result in free cash flow of $54.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004).
 
Financing Highlights
 
The Company has continued to strengthen its financial position through a combination of strong operational execution and thoughtful capital markets activities.
 
As previously announced, the Company's principal operating subsidiaries refinanced their existing senior secured credit facility with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. The new credit facility consists of $700.0 million in term loans, most of which was used to repay the existing credit facility and a portion of which was used to refinance other existing debt securities, and a $400.0 million revolving loan, of which approximately $373.3 million is available to refinance higher cost debt and for general corporate purposes. Consistent with prior disclosure and in connection with this refinancing, during the second quarter the Company recorded an $11.7 million loss due to the write-off of deferred financing fees relating to its prior credit facility.
 
With the completion of the new credit facility, the Company continued to implement its strategy of increasing financial flexibility and reducing its cost of capital and interest expense by repurchasing a total of $202.1 million of face amount in outstanding debt securities for an aggregate purchase price of $163.6 million in cash. The Company repurchased a total of $129.2 million of face amount in debt securities during the second quarter and an additional $72.9 million of face amount in debt securities subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2004. The securities repurchased consisted of $22.5 million of 5.0% convertible notes, $152.7 million face amount ($86.2 million in accreted value) of 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and $26.9 million of 9.375% senior notes. As a result of these repurchases, the Company anticipates saving approximately $18 million in annualized interest expense.
 
In connection with these debt repurchases, the Company recorded a $19.7 million loss on retirement of long-term obligations in the second quarter of 2004 consisting of $17.4 million paid in excess of accreted or face amount and $2.3 million in the write-off of deferred financing fees. In addition, the Company will record a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of approximately $11 million in the third quarter of 2004 in connection with the repurchases made subsequent to the end of the second quarter. Refer to the supplemental schedule provided on page 9 of this press release for a complete summary of our debt repurchase activity.

The combination of strong operating performance and refinancing activities reduced the Company's Net Leverage Ratio ("total debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments on hand divided by second quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA") as of June 30, 2004 to 7.0x from 8.4x for the same period in 2003.
 
Strategic Announcements
 
The Company is currently exploring strategic alternatives for its construction services group, including a potential sale of some or all of its construction services capabilities. The construction services group is currently included in the Company's network development services segment and had revenues of $21.2 million and approximately $14,000 of operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2004.
 
The network development services segment will continue to provide complementary non-construction services to the rental and management segment including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis.
 
2004 Outlook
 
The Company's full year and quarterly 2004 outlook for each of its operating segments is provided on page 10 of this press release.
 
The Company has modestly refined its third quarter and fourth quarter rental and management segment outlook by raising its third and fourth quarter rental and management segment operating profit outlook to $117 million to $120 million and $120 million to $123 million.
 
The Company has adjusted its network development services segment revenue and operating profit outlook for 2004 to $87 million to $97 million and $4 million to $6 million, respectively, reflecting continued margin pressure in the construction business.
 
As a result of refinancing the credit facility and debt repurchases during the second quarter of 2004, the Company has reduced its full year 2004 outlook for interest expense to $267 million to $271 million, including $76 million of non-cash interest, from $270 million to $279 million, including $84 million of non-cash interest. In addition, an estimate of $11 million loss on retirement of long-term obligations, attributed to the debt security repurchases subsequent to the second quarter of 2004, is included in the Company's outlook for the third quarter of 2004.
 
The Company has reduced its full year 2004 outlook for capital expenditures to a range between $44 million to $51 million due to lower than anticipated new tower construction in the first half of the year. The Company now expects to construct 90 to 110 new towers in 2004, down from its previous range of 120 to 150 towers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, we have presented the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage Ratio. These measures are not intended as substitutes for other measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. They are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of our core businesses. We believe that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Additionally, interest expense may vary significantly depending on capital structure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Same Tower Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Net Leverage Ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are included on pages 11 to 12 of this press release. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached as pages 5 to 7 of this press release.
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, our full year 2004 Outlook, and planned future asset acquisitions and sales. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results; (3) restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and indentures could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (4) our participation or inability to participate in tower industry consolidation could involve certain risks; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness of our tenants; (7) our foreign operations are subject to expropriation risk, governmental regulation, funds inaccessibility, and foreign exchange exposure; (8) a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers; (9) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues; (10) our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do; and (11) the bankruptcy proceeding of our Verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, which we incorporate herein by reference. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.
