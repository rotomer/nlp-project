The Senior Notes have the same terms as, and are fully fungible with, the 7.125% senior notes due 2012 issued by the Company on October 5, 2004 (the "Initial Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million. The Senior Notes were sold within the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States only to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.
 
On December 6, 2004, the Company announced that it intends to use all of the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to repurchase and redeem a portion of its 9

In connection with the Senior Notes offering, on December 6, 2004, the Company entered into Supplemental Indenture No. 1 (the "Supplemental Indenture") with The Bank of New York, as trustee, relating to the Senior Notes. The Supplemental Indenture is a supplement to the indenture for the Initial Notes (the "Original Indenture"), dated October 5, 2004, with The Bank of New York, as trustee. On December 6, 2004, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with Credit Suisse First Boston LLC (as representative of the Purchasers named therein) with respect to the Senior Notes on terms consistent with the Registration Rights Agreement for the Initial Notes (the "Original Registration Rights Agreement"), dated October 5, 2004, with Credit Suisse First Boston LLC (as representative of the Purchasers named therein). On December 6, 2004, the Company also entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Rights Agreement (the "Amendment") to amend the Original Registration Rights Agreement to reflect the issuance of the Senior Notes.
 
The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "October Form 8-K") with the Commission on October 5, 2004 containing summaries of the terms of the Initial Notes, the Original Indenture and the Original Registration Rights Agreement, which are incorporated herein by reference.

In no event shall the Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied.
 
(u) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts (i) if the Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Securities, to confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement; or (ii) if the Securities were not previously rated, to cause the Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be rated with at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency, if so requested by Majority Holders with respect to the related Registration Statement or by any Managing Underwriters.

(i) if such Rules or By-Laws shall so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in such Rules) to participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement, to exercise usual standards of due diligence with respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Securities;

(w) Prior to any public offering of the Securities or New Securities, pursuant to any Registration Statement, the Company shall register or qualify or cooperate with the Holders of the Securities included therein and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such states of the United States as any Holder of the Securities reasonably requests in writing and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the offer and sale in such jurisdictions of the Securities covered by such Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified or (ii) take any action which would subject it to general service of process or to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.
 
(x) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of the Securities or the New Securities, as the case may be, covered by a Registration Statement.
 
5. . The Company shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2, 3 and 4 hereof and, in the event of any Shelf Registration Statement, will reimburse the Holders for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel designated by the Majority Holders to act as counsel for the Holders in connection therewith, and, in the case of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, will reimburse the Purchasers for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one firm or counsel acting in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holders shall pay all agency fees and commissions and underwriting discounts and commissions and the fees and disbursements of any counsel or other advisors or experts retained by such Holders (severally or jointly), other than the counsel specifically referred to above.
Registration Expenses
 
6. . The Company, the Purchasers and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree by acquisition of such Securities that the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities will suffer damages if a Registration Default (as defined below) occurs and that it would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision. Accordingly, the Company, the Purchasers and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that the following additional interest provisions shall constitute liquidated damages in the event of a "Registration Default" (as defined below) and shall constitute the sole remedy of the Purchasers and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities for any Registration Defaults.
Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances
 
(a) In accordance with the terms of the Securities, additional interest ("Additional Interest") with respect to the Securities and New Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below being herein called a "Registration Default"):
 
(i) on or prior to the 90
th
day following October 5, 2004 neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission;
 
(ii) on or prior to the 210
th
day following October 5, 2004 ( the "Effectiveness Target Date"), neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective;
 
(iii) on or prior to 30 Business Days following the Effectiveness Target Date, the Registered Exchange Offer has not been consummated; or
 
(iv) any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective by the Commission but (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein.
 
Each of the foregoing shall constitute a Registration Default whatever the reason for any such event and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is beyond the control of the Company or pursuant to operation of law or as a result of any action or inaction by the Commission; , that the Company shall in no event be required to pay Additional Interest for more than one Registration Default at any given time.
provided,
however
 
Additional Interest shall be assessed on the Securities or New Securities, from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults shall have been cured, at a rate of $.05 per week per $1,000 of principal amount of notes held (the "Additional Interest Amount") for the first 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default. The Additional Interest Amount will increase by an additional $.05 per week per $1,000 of principal amount of notes with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum amount of Additional Interest for all Registration Defaults of $.25 per week per $1,000 of principal amount of notes.
 
(b) Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to Section 6(a) shall be paid to the Holders entitled thereto on June 1 and December 1 of any given year as more fully set forth in the Indenture and the Securities.
 
7. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement (including each Purchaser and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer), the directors, officers, employees and agents of each such Holder, Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer and each Person who controls any such Holder, Purchaser or Exchanging Dealer within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein and , , that the Company shall not be liable for any loss, claim, damage or expense (1) arising from any offer or sale of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Registration Statement, during a 30-day or 90 day period referenced in Section 4(k) hereof, of which the Holder has received written notice, or (2) if the Holder fails to deliver, within the time required by the Securities Act, a Prospectus that is amended or supplemented, and such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, would have corrected the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Prospectus delivered by the Holder, so long as the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, has been delivered to such Holder prior to such time. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
provided
further
 
The Company also agrees to indemnify or contribute as provided in Section 7(d) to Losses of any underwriter of Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, registered under a Shelf Registration Statement, their directors, officers, employees or agents and each Person who controls such underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the indemnification of the Purchasers and the selling Holders provided in this Section 7(a) and shall, if requested by any Holder, enter into an underwriting agreement reflecting such agreement, as provided in Section 4(p) hereof.
 
(b) Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including each Purchaser and, with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer) severally, but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs such Registration Statement and each Person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and is prejudiced thereby; and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes (i) an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement
provided,
however
 
as to or an admission of fault or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable under subsections (a), (b) or (c) of this Section for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; , , that such indemnifying party has notified in writing the indemnified party of its refusal to accept such settlement within 30 days of its receipt of a notice from the indemnified party outlining the terms of such settlement.
provided
however
 
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Placement and the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; , , that in no case shall any Purchaser of any Security or New Security be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission applicable to such Security, or in the case of a New Security, applicable to the Security that was exchangeable into such New Security, as set forth in the Final Memorandum, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the securities purchased by such underwriter under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses, nor shall any subsequent Holder of any Security or New Security be responsible, in the aggregate, for any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such Holder from the resale of such securities under the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section, each Person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each Person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
 
(e) The provisions of this Section will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling Persons referred to in this Section hereof, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.
 
8. . In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement required under this Agreement, the Company may enter into one or more underwriting agreements, engagement letters, agency agreements, "best efforts" underwriting agreements or similar agreements, as appropriate, including customary provisions relating to indemnification and contribution, and take such other actions in connection therewith as the Majority Holders shall request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Securities.
Underwritten Registrations
 
(a) If any of the Securities or New Securities, as the case may be, covered by any Shelf Registration Statement are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders provided that such Managing Underwriters shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a Broker-Dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a Broker-Dealer in connection with resales of New Securities received in exchange for Securities where such Securities were acquired by such Broker-Dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, starting on the Expiration Date (as defined herein) and ending on the close of business 180 days after the Expiration Date, it will make this Prospectus available to any Broker-Dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution".

Each Broker-Dealer that receives New Securities for its own account pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such New Securities. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a Broker-Dealer in connection with resales of New Securities received in exchange for Securities where such Securities were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from any sale of New Securities by brokers-dealers. New Securities received by Broker-Dealers for their own account pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer may be sold from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the New Securities or a combination of such methods of resale, at market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such Broker-Dealer and/or the purchasers of any such New Securities. Any Broker-Dealer that resells New Securities that were received by it for its own account pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such New Securities may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act and any profit of any such resale of New Securities and any commissions or concessions received by any such Persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Act. The Letter of Transmittal states that by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a Broker-Dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Act.
 
For a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date, the Company will promptly send additional copies of this Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this Prospectus to any Broker-Dealer that requests such documents in the Letter of Transmittal. The Company has agreed to pay all expenses incident to the Registered Exchange Offer (including the expenses of one counsel for the holder of the Securities) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the holders of the Securities (including any Broker-Dealers) against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Act.

The Company sold a total of $200.0 million principal amount of notes, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $199.8 million. The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase and redeem a portion of its outstanding 9

The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase today approximately $85.2 million of its outstanding 9

The Company also announced today the call for redemption of $133.0 million principal amount of its 9

As a result of this repurchase and partial redemption of its 9

The Company expects this issuance of its 7.125% senior notes and this repurchase and partial redemption of its outstanding 9

This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the notes. The notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and outside the United States only to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, the notes may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
 
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" regarding the redemption of the Company's senior notes and the resulting expected cost savings from refinancing activities. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements include uncertainties relating to the amount of senior notes actually redeemed and the timing of the redemption of the senior notes.
