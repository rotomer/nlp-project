FULL YEAR 2004 HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004. The financial results discussed in this press release reflect the impact of the Company's previously disclosed restatement of its historical financial statements for periods ending on or prior to September 30, 2004, as discussed in more detail below.
Boston, Massachusetts  March 30, 2005
 
Total revenues increased 11% to $184.7 million and 12% to $706.7 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same periods in 2003. Rental and management revenue increased 9% to $177.3 million and 10% to $684.4 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same periods in 2003.
 
Rental and management segment operating profit increased 13% to $120.6 million and 16% to $461.4 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same periods in 2003.
 
Adjusted EBITDA (defined as income from operations before depreciation, amortization and accretion and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense, plus interest income, TV Azteca, net) increased 13% to $114.1 million and 17% to $437.4 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same periods in 2003. Due to the previously disclosed correction of the Company's accounting practices for ground leases, the rental and management segment operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA include additional non-cash straight-line rent expense of $2.6 million and $11.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004, and $3.2 million and $14.0 million for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2003.

Loss from continuing operations was $68.2 million, or $(0.30) per share, and net loss was $74.0 million, or $(0.32) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2004.

For the full year ended December 31, 2004, income from operations increased to $69.8 million, as compared to a loss of $2.6

Jim Taiclet, American Tower's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated "We fully expect to continue experiencing robust demand for tower space in 2005. Subscriber growth remains a key driver of tower lease-up demand and we anticipate that new marketing and branding initiatives being launched or expanded by wireless carriers and MVNOs will attract major affinity groups, creating momentum for subscriber growth. In addition, our carrier customers continue to view network quality as a critical competitive advantage necessary for attracting new customers and limiting churn. Recent public announcements by wireless carriers confirm their commitment to continue investing the capital necessary to develop their wireless networks, even in the midst of consolidation in the sector.
 
"At American Tower, we are continuing our focus on our core leasing business. As wireless subscribers and minutes-of-use expand and carriers invest in their networks, we maintain our commitment to meeting their infrastructure needs through operational improvement initiatives and development of our talent. We are dedicated to supporting our customers' need for speed to market by delivering faster and higher quality service, while efficiently investing in our business systems and the people who provide it.
 
"We continue to have confidence in delivering another year of strong results in 2005, based on our expectation of roughly similar levels of tower demand as last year, our significant operating leverage through rigorous cost control, and our improved financial position."
 
Financing Highlights
 
The Company continued to thoughtfully access the capital markets and utilize its free cash flow to strengthen its financial position.
 
As previously announced, the Company issued $300 million of 7.125% senior notes due 2012 in October of 2004 and an additional $200 million of these notes in December of 2004. The net proceeds and approximately $30 million of cash on hand were used to repurchase or redeem $494 million principal amount of 9.375% senior notes due 2009, including $361 million principal amount in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $133 million principal amount in January of 2005.
 
In addition, the Company continued to use its free cash flow to repurchase its 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008. The Company repurchased a total of $163 million face amount ($98 million of accreted value, net of $7 million fair value allocated to the warrants) of its 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 for an aggregate purchase price of $123 million in cash, $126 million face amount of which were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $37 million face amount of which were repurchased subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
The Company reduced its Net Leverage Ratio (defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments on hand divided by fourth quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA) to 6.7x as of December 31, 2004.
 
 
2005 Quarterly and Full Year Outlook
 
The following estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, and reflect the Company's expectations as of March 30, 2005. Please refer to the cautionary language regarding "forward-looking" statements included in this press release when considering this information. The Company undertakes no obligation to update this information.
 
 
Lease-Related Accounting Adjustments and Restatement
 
As discussed in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2005, in February 2005, the Company undertook a review of its lease accounting practices as a result of changes in lease accounting announced by other public companies in January and February of 2005 and guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its February 7, 2005 letter to the accounting industry. As a result of this review, the Company determined that it should change the periods used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense and straight-line rent expense relating to certain of its tower assets and underlying ground leases. Accordingly, the Company restated its historical financial statements and, earlier today, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an amended annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q/A for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004, to reflect the restatement.
 
 
The primary effect of this accounting correction was to accelerate to earlier periods non-cash rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense with respect to certain of the Company's tower sites, resulting in an increase in non-cash expenses compared to what was previously reported. The restatement did not affect the Company's historical or future cash flows provided by operating activities.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, we have presented the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA and Net Leverage Ratio. These measures are not intended as substitutes for other measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. They are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of our core businesses. We believe that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Our concern is that depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Additionally, interest expense may vary significantly depending on capital structure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Net Leverage Ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are included on page 10 of this press release. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached as pages 6 to 8 of this press release.
 
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning our goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, our first quarter and full year 2005 Outlook and planned future capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) a decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results; (2) our substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results; (3) restrictive covenants in our loan agreement and indentures could adversely affect our business by further limiting our flexibility; (4) our participation or inability to participate in tower industry consolidation could involve certain risks; (5) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (6) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, we are dependent on the creditworthiness
 
 
of our tenants; (7) our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks; (8) a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a small number of customers; (9) the status of Iusacell Celular's financial restructuring exposes us to risks; (10) new technologies could make our tower antenna leasing services less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues; (11) we could have liability under environmental laws; (12) our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do; (13) increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures; (14) if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business; (15) our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions; and (16) the bankruptcy proceeding of our Verestar subsidiary exposes us to risks and uncertainties. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information under the caption entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results" in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, which we incorporate herein by reference. We undertake no obligation to update the information contained in this press release to reflect subsequently occurring events or circumstances.
