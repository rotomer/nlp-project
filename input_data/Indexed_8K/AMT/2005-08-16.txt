Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed August 8, 2005, on August 8, 2005, American Tower Corporation (the "Company") completed its merger with SpectraSite, Inc. ("SpectraSite") and, in connection therewith, increased the size of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") from six to ten members and added four new directors to the Board. At a meeting held on August 10, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved an increase in annual compensation for the Company's non-employee directors. The following information updates the information contained in the Company's Proxy Statement filed April 27, 2005, with respect to compensation for members of the Board:
 
On August 10, 2005, the Company modified its standard compensatory arrangement with its non-employee directors. The Company increased the annual retainer for serving on the Board from $40,000 to $50,000. The Company also expanded the list of recipients who receive an additional $10,000 annual payment from each chairperson of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, to include the lead director of the Board and the directors who serve as members of such Board committees. Total payments to any one director for Board and committee service are capped at $70,000 per year. In addition, directors remain eligible to receive options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The Company typically grants directors a fully-vested option to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock in the year that they are elected to the Board. Thereafter, the Company typically grants each director annually a fully vested option to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
