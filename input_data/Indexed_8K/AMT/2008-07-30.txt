SECOND QUARTER 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Boston, Massachusetts  July 30, 2008:
Jim Taiclet, American Tower's Chief Executive Officer stated, "We continued to perform well in the second quarter as demonstrated by our 10% and 13% revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively. Moreover, demand for our tower space remains strong in all of our markets, which allows us to confidently raise our full year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA outlook.
"While we continue to achieve solid growth from our current portfolio of assets, we are active in evaluating opportunities to add new assets in both our existing markets and new high growth markets including India, where we have recently completed the construction of our first operational towers. At the same time, we remain disciplined in allocating capital to new assets only when we can achieve an appropriate return. In addition, our solid financial position and significant free cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to pursue these strategic opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program."
Second Quarter 2008 Operating Highlights
American Tower generated the following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 (unless otherwise indicated, all comparative information is presented against the quarter ended June 30, 2007):
Total revenue increased 9.9% to $393.7 million and rental and management segment revenue increased 9.6% to $384.3 million. Rental and Management Segment Gross Margin increased 10.3% to $296.0 million, and network development services segment revenue and Gross Margin increased to $9.4 million and $4.5 million, respectively.

Operating income increased to $154.8 million and income from continuing operations increased to $50.7 million, which includes approximately $30.8 million pre-tax and $19.2 million, net of tax, respectively, related to the Company's previously disclosed change in useful life estimates for its towers and related intangible assets.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following non-GAAP and defined financial measures: Rental and Management Segment Gross Margin, Network Development Services Segment Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow. American Tower defines Rental and Management Segment Gross Margin as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, corporate expenses, rental and management segment overhead, network development services segment overhead, network development services segment operating expenses, network development services segment revenue, plus interest income, TV Azteca, net. American Tower defines Network Development Services Segment Gross Margin as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation expense, corporate expenses, network development services segment
 
overhead, rental and management segment overhead, rental and management segment operating expenses, and rental and management segment revenue. American Tower defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation expense, plus interest income, TV Azteca, net. American Tower defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA over total revenue. American Tower defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchase of property and equipment and construction activities. These measures are not intended as substitutes for other measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. They are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of our core businesses. We believe that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors including historical cost bases are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's measures of Rental and Management Segment Gross Margin, Network Development Services Segment Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" concerning the Company's goals, beliefs, expectations, strategies, objectives, plans, future operating results and underlying assumptions, and other statements that are not necessarily based on historical facts. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our full year 2008 outlook, our stock repurchase programs and our international business development initiatives. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: (1) decrease in demand for tower space would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand; (2) if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected; (3) substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect us; (4) restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, the indentures governing our debt securities, and the loan agreement related to our securitization transaction could adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility; (5) we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for income taxes that, until remediated, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements; (6) we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions, or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses; (7) due to the long-term expectations of revenue from tenant leases, the tower industry is sensitive to the credit worthiness of its tenants; (8) our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position; (9) a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers; (10) we anticipate that we may need additional financing to fund our stock repurchase programs, to refinance our existing indebtedness and to fund future growth and expansion initiatives; (11) new technologies could make our tower leasing business less desirable to potential tenants and result in decreasing revenues; (12) we could have liability under environmental laws; (13) our business is subject to governmental regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do; (14) increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may adversely affect us; (15) if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results; (16) if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated; (17) our towers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen damage for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; (18) our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these risks are substantiated; (19) our historical stock option granting practices are subject to ongoing governmental proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties or other liability; and (20) pending civil litigation relating to our historical stock option granting practices exposes us to risks and uncertainties. For other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements, we refer you to the information contained in Item 1A of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 under the caption "Risk Factors."
