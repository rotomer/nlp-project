In addition, our development teams remained focused on seeking opportunities for further investment, with the launch of operations in Chile demonstrating one of their recent successes. We believe the continued solid growth in our existing business and our investments will provide compelling long-term returns for our shareholders."

India Acquisition Update
On July 26, 2010, the Company received the requisite approval from India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board in connection with its previously announced acquisition of Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ("ETIPL"). Accordingly, the Company expects to close this acquisition by the end of the third quarter of 2010, subject to the satisfaction of the remaining closing conditions. The total cash consideration for the approximately 4,450 communication tower sites to be acquired in this transaction is estimated to be approximately $430 million, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In addition, on July 23, 2010, the Company borrowed approximately $350 million under its $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which in addition to cash on hand, will be used to satisfy the Company's cash requirements at closing.
Full Year 2010 Outlook
Based on its performance during the first half of 2010, along with its expectation that its acquisition of ETIPL will be completed during the third quarter, the Company is updating its Full Year 2010 outlook. These estimates are based on a number of assumptions that management believes to be reasonable and reflect the Company's expectations as of August 3, 2010. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of various factors, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and we refer you to the cautionary language regarding "forward-looking" statements included in this press release when considering this information.
The Company's outlook is based on the following foreign exchange rates for the second half of 2010: (a) 12.6 Mexican Pesos to 1.0 US Dollar; (b) 1.8 Brazilian Real to 1.0 US Dollar; and (c) 46.5 Indian Rupees to 1.0 US Dollar.
 
Rental and management segment revenue Core Growth, excluding the effect of non-cash straight-line revenue recognition, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and material one-time items for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately 9.6%, based on the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA Core Growth, excluding the effect of non-cash straight-line revenue and expense recognition, fluctuations in foreign currency rates and material one-time items for the full year 2010 is expected to be approximately 7.1%, based on the midpoint.

Non-GAAP and Defined Financial Measures
In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, the Company has presented the following non-GAAP and defined financial measures: rental and management segment Gross Margin, network development services segment Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Recurring Free Cash Flow, Recurring Free Cash Flow per Share, and Core Growth. The Company defines rental and management segment Gross Margin as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion, other operating expenses, stock-based compensation expense, corporate expenses, rental and management segment overhead, network development services segment overhead, network development services segment operating expenses, network development services segment revenue, plus interest income, TV Azteca, net. The Company defines network development services segment Gross Margin as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion, other operating expenses, stock-based compensation expense, corporate expenses, network development services segment overhead, rental and management segment overhead, rental and management segment operating expenses, and rental and management segment revenue. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating income before depreciation, amortization and accretion, other operating expenses, and stock-based compensation expense, plus interest income, TV Azteca, net. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the percentage that results from dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. The Company defines Recurring Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA before straight-line revenue and expense, plus interest income, less interest expense, cash paid for income taxes and cash payments related to redevelopment, capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures. The Company defines Recurring Free Cash Flow per Share as Recurring Free Cash Flow divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The Company defines Core Growth in rental and management segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA as the increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, resulting from a comparison of financial results for a current period with corresponding financial results for the corresponding period in a prior year, in each case, excluding the impact of straight-line revenue and expense recognition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and material one-time items. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as additional information because management believes they are useful indicators of the current financial performance of the Company's core businesses. The Company believes that these measures can assist in comparing company performances on a consistent basis irrespective of depreciation and amortization or capital structure. Depreciation and amortization can vary significantly among companies depending on accounting methods, particularly where acquisitions or non-operating factors, including historical cost bases, are involved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's measures of Rental and management segment Gross Margin, network development services segment Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Recurring Free Cash Flow, Recurring Free Cash Flow per Share, and Core Growth may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to statements regarding our full year 2010 outlook and expected net cash consideration and anticipated closing date of our contemplated ETIPL acquisition.
