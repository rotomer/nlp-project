Explanatory Note:
As further described below, as part of the plan to reorganize the business operations of American Tower Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Predecessor Registrant"), so that it can elect to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, the Predecessor Registrant merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary American Tower REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), on December 31, 2011, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 24, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement"), with the Company as the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). At 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 31, 2011, the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), the Company was renamed "American Tower Corporation" and commenced, directly or indirectly, conducting all of the business conducted by the Predecessor Registrant immediately prior to the Merger.
This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed for the purpose of establishing the Company as the successor issuer to the Predecessor Registrant pursuant to Rule 12g-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and to disclose events required to be disclosed on Form 8-K with respect to the Predecessor Registrant prior to the Effective Time and the Company as of the Effective Time. Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, the shares of Common Stock (as defined below) of the Company, as successor issuer, are deemed registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.
 
Loan Assumption Agreement
On December 30, 2011, in connection with the Merger, the Company, the Predecessor Registrant and Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC entered into an Assumption Agreement (the "Assumption Agreement") with respect to the Loan Agreement, dated as of June 8, 2007, among the Predecessor Registrant, as Borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and The Toronto Dominion Bank, New York Branch, as Issuing Banks, Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and the several lenders that are parties thereto (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Pursuant to the Assumption Agreement, as of the Effective Time, the Company assumed all of the obligations of the Predecessor Registrant under the Revolving Credit Facility and all related loan documents and other agreements.
The foregoing description of the Assumption Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Assumption Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
Supplemental Indentures
On December 30, 2011, in connection with the Merger, the Company, the Predecessor Registrant and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), entered into the following supplemental indentures (each a "Supplemental Indenture," and collectively, the "Supplemental Indentures"):
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the Supplemental Indentures, as of the Effective Time, the Company assumed all of the obligations of the Predecessor Registrant under the respective indentures and related Senior Notes.
The foregoing description of the Supplemental Indentures is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Supplemental Indentures, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as of the Effective Time, the Predecessor Registrant was merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation. The Merger was consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger, effective as of December 31, 2011 (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. A copy of the Certificate of Merger is attached as Exhibit 3.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
On January 3, 2012, the Company issued a press release, announcing the completion of the Merger, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
As a result of the Merger, as of the Effective Time, the Company assumed by operation of law all of the prior debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Predecessor Registrant and such debts, liabilities, obligations and duties may be enforced against the Company to the same extent as if the Company had itself incurred or contracted all such debts, liabilities, obligations and duties. For more information concerning these debts, liabilities, obligations and duties, see generally the Predecessor Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011 and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed prior to the date hereof.
The information included under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is also incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.
 
As further described below in Item 3.03, as of the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Predecessor Registrant (the "Class A Common Stock") automatically converted into the right to receive an equal number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"). Similar to the shares of Class A Common Stock prior to the Merger, the shares of Common Stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "AMT." In anticipation of the Merger, the Predecessor Registrant requested the NYSE to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Form 25 to remove the shares of Class A Common Stock from listing on the NYSE effective January 3, 2012. The Predecessor Registrant expects to file a Form 15 with the SEC to terminate the registration of shares of Class A Common Stock. The new listing of shares of Common Stock on the NYSE is effective as of January 3, 2012.
 
As described above, as of the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock of the Predecessor Registrant automatically converted into the right to receive an equal number of shares of Common Stock of the Company. The issuance of the Common Stock was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), pursuant to the Company's registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-174684 ), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 22, 2011. The form of stock certificate for the Common Stock is set forth in Exhibit 4.2 hereto. The Common Stock is subject to certain share ownership and transfer restrictions as discussed below.
As a result of the Merger, as of the Effective Time, the rights of the stockholders of the Company are governed by the Company's restated certificate of incorporation (the "Restated Certificate") and the Company's amended and restated by-laws (the "Amended By-Laws"). To satisfy requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that are applicable to REITs in general and otherwise to address concerns relating to capital stock ownership, the Restated Certificate generally prohibits any stockholder from owning more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or any other class or series of the Company's stock. These limitations are subject to waiver or modification by the board of directors of the Company.
The foregoing description of the Common Stock is qualified in its entirety by the description of the Common Stock contained in the "Description of Capital Stock" attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the foregoing description of the Common Stock is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Restated Certificate and the Amended By-Laws, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
The information included under the caption "Supplemental Indentures" under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is also incorporated into this Item 3.03 by reference.
 
Directors and Officers
The directors and executive officers of the Predecessor Registrant are also the directors and executive officers of the Company and remain so following the Merger, with each holding the same position or positions with the Company as with the Predecessor Registrant immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company's directors will be subject to re-election at the 2012 annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company. In addition, the standing committees (Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance) are the same standing committees of the Predecessor Registrant, and the membership of each committee remains unchanged.
Assumption of Employee Stock Plans and Awards
As a result of the Merger, as of the Effective Time, the Company assumed the Predecessor Registrant's equity incentive related plans and related award agreements, including the American Tower Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated American Tower Systems Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan, the SpectraSite, Inc. 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, the American Tower Corporation 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the American Tower Retirement Savings Plan (collectively, the "Plans," and each a "Plan"). As of the Effective Time, all rights of participants to acquire shares of Class A Common Stock under any Plan were automatically converted into rights to acquire an equal number of shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Plans and the applicable award agreements.
The Predecessor Registrant maintained a number of benefit plans, compensation arrangements and policies for its directors, officers and employees. None of these plans, compensation arrangements or policies were affected by the Merger and the Company assumed any and all of Predecessor Registrant's obligations under each of the plans, compensation arrangements and policies by operation of law in the Merger. Likewise, the employment agreements between Predecessor Registrant with each of Messrs. Taiclet, Bartlett, DiSanto, Hess, Marshall and Sharma were not affected by the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. None of the Company's directors, officers or employees received any additional or special compensation (either in the form of cash, deferred compensation or equity awards) as a result of the Merger.
For more information concerning the Plans, compensation arrangements, policies and employment agreements, see generally the Predecessor Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011, June 30, 2011 and September 30, 2011 and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed prior to the date hereof.
The Company has adopted forms of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (U.S.) and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (International), both pursuant to the American Tower Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, which it will enter into in connection with grants of restricted stock units made after the Effective Time. The agreements provide for, among other things, the accrual of dividends declared on granted, but unvested, restricted stock units. The forms of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (U.S.) and Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (International) are attached here to as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively, and incorporated into this Item 5.02 by reference.
 
The Registrant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended By-Laws were declared effective immediately preceding the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, the Company's Restated Certificate and Amended By-Laws were amended, pursuant to the Certificate of Merger, to change the Company's name from "American Tower REIT, Inc." to "American Tower Corporation."
The Company's Restated Certificate, Certificate of Merger, and Amended By-Laws are attached hereto as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

(iv) No Person shall Constructively Own shares of Equity Stock to the extent that such Constructive Ownership would cause any income of the Corporation that would otherwise qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of Section 856(d) of the Code to fail to qualify as such.
(v) Notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein but subject to Section 4, any Transfer of shares of Equity Stock that, if effective, would result in the Equity Stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 Persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code) shall be void AB INITIO, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares of Equity Stock.
(b) . If any Transfer or Non-Transfer Event occurs which, if effective or otherwise, would result in any Person Beneficially Owning or Constructively Owning (as applicable) shares of Equity Stock in violation of Section 2.1(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv),
Transfer in Trust

(ii) if the transfer to the Trust or Trusts described in clause (i) of this sentence would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 2.1(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), then the Transfer of that number of shares of Equity Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section 2.1(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be void AB INITIO, and the intended transferee shall acquire no rights in such shares of Equity Stock.

Owners Required to Provide Information
(a) every owner of five percent or more (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the outstanding shares of any class or series of Equity Stock, upon request following the end of each taxable year of the Corporation, shall provide in writing to the Corporation the name and address of such owner, the number of shares of each class and series of Equity Stock and other shares of the Equity Stock Beneficially Owned by it and a description of the manner in which such shares are held. Each such owner shall provide to the Corporation such additional information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Beneficial Ownership on the Corporation's qualification as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the Stock Ownership Limit; and
(b) each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of Equity Stock and each Person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding Equity Stock for a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner shall provide in writing to the Corporation such information as the Corporation may request, in good faith, in order to determine the Corporation's qualification as a REIT and to comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance.
2.5 .

Without limitation of the foregoing, in response to shares (or other securities) forfeited under Article FOURTH, Section D, the Board of Directors may apply the Stock Ownership Limit, any Excepted Holder Limit, and the ownership limitations of Section 2.1(a) in any fashion that conservatively measures the Corporation's qualification as a REIT, for example, treating such forfeited shares (or other securities) as outstanding and in the numerators of the Person who forfeited such shares (or other securities) but at the same time treating such forfeited shares (or other securities) as no longer outstanding and excluded from the denominators of other Persons.
Ambiguity
2.7
Exceptions
(a) Subject to Section 2.1(a)(iii), the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may prospectively or retroactively exempt a Person from one or more of the ownership limitations set forth in Section 2.1(a)(i) and establish or increase an Excepted Holder Limit for such Person, may waive the provisions of Section 2.1(a)(ii) with respect to a Person, and/or may prospectively or retroactively waive the provisions of Section 2.1(a)(iv) with respect to a Person if:
(i) the Board of Directors obtains such representations and undertakings from such Person as are reasonably necessary to ascertain that such Person's Beneficial Ownership and Constructive Ownership of such shares of Equity Stock in excess of the Stock Ownership Limit or in violation of the limitations imposed by Section 2.1(a)(ii) or Section 2.1(a)(iv), as applicable, will not now or in the future jeopardize the Corporation's ability to qualify as a REIT under the Code; and
(ii) such Person agrees that any violation or attempted violation of such representations or undertakings (or other action which is contrary to the restrictions contained in Sections 2.1 through 2.6) will result in such shares of Equity Stock being automatically transferred to a Trust in accordance with Sections 2.1(b) and 3.
(b) Prior to granting any exemption or waiver or creating any Excepted Holder Limit pursuant to Section 2.7(a), the Board of Directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Corporation's qualification as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion, the Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with granting such exemption or waiver or creating any Excepted Holder Limit.
(c) Subject to Section 2.1(a)(iii), an underwriter or placement agent (or Person acquiring securities for a similar purpose and function) that participates in a public offering or a private placement of Equity Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Equity Stock) may Beneficially Own and Constructively Own shares of Equity Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Equity Stock) in excess of the Stock Ownership Limit but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such public offering or private placement.
(d) The Board of Directors may reduce the Excepted Holder Limit for an Excepted Holder only: (i) with the written consent of such Excepted Holder at any time, or (ii) pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreements and undertakings entered into with such Excepted Holder in connection with the establishment of the Excepted Holder Limit for that Excepted Holder.

2.8 . Subject to Section 2.1(a)(iii), the Board of Directors may from time to time increase the Stock Ownership Limit (or any portion thereof) for one or more Persons and decrease the Stock Ownership Limit (or any portion thereof) for all other Persons; provided, however, that (i) any such decreased Stock Ownership Limit (or portion thereof) will not be effective for any Person whose ownership in Equity Stock is in excess of the decreased Stock Ownership Limit (or portion thereof) until such time as such Person's ownership in Equity Stock equals or falls below the decreased Stock Ownership Limit (or such decreased portion thereof), but any further Transfers of any Equity Stock resulting in such Person's Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership thereof creating an increased excess over the decreased Stock Ownership Limit (or portion thereof) will be in violation of the decreased Stock Ownership Limit (or portion thereof); and (ii) any new Stock Ownership Limit (or portion thereof) would not result in the Corporation being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Codewithout regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) if five unrelated individuals were to Beneficially Own the five largest amounts of Equity Stock permitted to be Beneficially Owned under such new Stock Ownership Limit, taking into account clause (i) of this proviso permitting ownership in excess of the decreased Stock Ownership Limit (or portion thereof) in certain cases.
Increase or Decrease in Stock Ownership Limit

The Corporation shall have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares held in the Trust pursuant to Section 3.5. Upon such a sale to the Corporation, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale, reduced by any amounts previously received by the Prohibited Owner pursuant to Section 3.5 in connection with prior extraordinary distributions, to the Prohibited Owner; provided, however, that the Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions which has been paid to the Prohibited Owner and is owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.3.

The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he, or a person for whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise or non profit entity against all liability, losses, expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
2. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise or non profit entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the
extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
3. To the extent that any person referred to in paragraphs 1 or 2 has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to therein, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.
4. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article SEVENTH, except for proceedings to enforce rights provided in this Article SEVENTH, the Corporation shall not be obligated under this Article SEVENTH to provide any indemnification or any payment or reimbursement of expenses to any director, officer, employee or other person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person (which shall not include counterclaims or cross-claims initiated by others) unless the Board of Directors has authorized or consented to such proceeding (or part thereof) in a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
B. . Any indemnification under Section 1 of this Article SEVENTH (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 of this Article SEVENTH. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination: (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (b) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (c) if there are no such directors or if such directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders.
Authorization
C. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by a current officer or director of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid or reimbursed by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding. However, any such officer or director seeking such payment or reimbursement must commit in writing that he or she shall repay any such amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not, in fact, entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to this Article SEVENTH. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former officers or directors or other employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
Expense Advance
D. . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article SEVENTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Nonexclusivity
E. . The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or

F. . For the purposes of this Article SEVENTH, references to "" shall include the resulting corporation and, to the extent that the Board of Directors of the resulting corporation so decides, all constituent corporations (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise or non profit entity shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article SEVENTH with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation if its separate existence had continued.

the Corporation
G. . The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non profit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non profit entity or from insurance. Nothing in this Article SEVENTH shall limit the power of the Corporation or the Board of Directors to provide rights of indemnification and to make payment of expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer to directors, officers, employees, agents, fiduciaries and other persons otherwise than pursuant to this Article SEVENTH.
Other Indemnification

Continuation of Indemnification
J. . The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided in this Article SEVENTH shall be contract rights and shall be deemed to have vested at the time the indemnitee takes the office that entitles such person to such rights, which shall not later be subject to reduction or elimination for acts or omissions occurring prior to such reduction or elimination. Neither the amendment nor repeal of this Article SEVENTH nor the adoption of any provision of these By-Laws inconsistent with this Article SEVENTH shall reduce, eliminate or adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the effectiveness of such amendment, repeal or adoption.

Other Offices
The seal of the Corporation shall, subject to alteration by the Board of Directors, consist of a flat-faced circular die with the word "Delaware", together with the name of the Corporation and the year of incorporation, cut or engraved thereon.
SECTION 1. . Meetings of the stockholders shall be held either within or without the State of Delaware at such place, if any, as the Board of Directors may fix from time to time. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that meetings of stockholders shall be held solely by means of remote communications.
Place of Meeting
SECTION 2. . The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors may fix from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual meeting.
Annual Meetings
SECTION 3. . Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, if there be one, the President or by the directors (either by written instrument signed by a majority or by resolution adopted by a vote of the majority), and special meetings shall be called by the President or the Secretary whenever stockholders owning a majority of the capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote so request in writing. Such request of stockholders shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting and such purpose or purposes shall be included in the notice of meeting given by the Corporation pursuant to Section 4 of Article III.
Special Meetings
SECTION 4. . Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the meeting shall be given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
Notice
SECTION 5. . Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the presence in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders of the holders of a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, shall be requisite and shall constitute a quorum. So long as the Certificate of Incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share, or any matter, every reference in these By-Laws to a majority or other proportion of shares shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such shares. If two or more classes of stock are entitled to vote as separate classes upon any question, then, in the case of each such class, a quorum for the consideration of such question shall, except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, consist of a majority in interest of all stock of that class issued, outstanding and entitled to vote. If a majority of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat or, where a larger quorum is required, such quorum, shall not be represented at any meeting of the stockholders regularly called, the holders of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereat shall have power to adjourn the meeting to another time, or to another time and place, without notice other than announcement of adjournment at the meeting, and there may be successive adjournments for like cause and in like manner until the requisite amount of shares entitled to vote at such meeting shall be represented; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. Subject to the requirements of law and the Certificate of Incorporation, on any issue on which two or more classes of stock are entitled to vote separately, no adjournment shall be taken with respect to any class for which a quorum is present unless the Chairman of the meeting otherwise directs. At any meeting held to consider matters which were subject to adjournment for want of a quorum at which the requisite amount of shares entitled to vote thereat shall be represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual or special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or by the President. The chairman of a meeting of stockholders may adjourn or recess such meeting once convened, whether or not a quorum is present.
Quorum and Adjournments
SECTION 6. . Except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, at each meeting of stockholders, every stockholder of record on the record date set by the Board of Directors for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in such stockholder's name on the books of the Corporation.
Votes; Proxies
Each stockholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to vote for such stockholder by a proxy executed or transmitted in a manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") by the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized agent and delivered (including by electronic transmission) to the Secretary of the Corporation. No such proxy shall be voted upon after three years from the date of its execution, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or any interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing with the Secretary of the Corporation an instrument in writing or as otherwise permitted by law revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date.
Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot and, except as otherwise provided by law, need not be conducted by an inspector of election unless so determined by the Chairman of the meeting or by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting. If it is required or determined that an inspector of election be appointed, the Chairman shall appoint one inspector of election, who shall first take and subscribe an oath or affirmation faithfully to execute the duties of an inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. The inspectors so appointed shall take charge of the polls and, after the balloting, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote taken. No director or candidate for the office of director shall be appointed as such inspector.
Except as otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-Laws, at any meeting at which a quorum is present, all action with respect to matters properly brought before such meeting taken by a majority of the votes properly cast, excluding abstentions and broker non-votes, shall be valid and binding on the Corporation; provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes properly cast if the number of candidates properly nominated for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the close of business on the record date for such meeting. For purposes of this Section 6 of this Article, a majority of votes shall mean that the number of votes properly cast "for" an action must exceed the number of votes properly cast "against" such action.
SECTION 7. . The Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or in his or her absence the Vice Chairman, or in the absence of a Vice Chairman, the President, or in the absence of the President, a Vice President, shall call meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman thereof. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present, shall act as secretary of all meetings of stockholders, and, in his or her absence, the presiding officer may appoint a secretary.

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (vi) an agreement that the stockholder of record and any related beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made will notify the Corporation in writing of the information set forth in clauses (ii)(B), (ii)(C) and (iii) above as of the record date for the meeting promptly (and, in any event, within five business days) following the later of the record date or the date notice of the record date is first disclosed by public disclosure, and will update such information thereafter within two business days of any change in such information and, in any event, as of the close of business on the day preceding the meeting date. The foregoing notice requirements of this paragraph (c) of this Section 8 shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his, her or its intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such meeting.
(d) Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business (other than the nomination of a person for election as a director, which is governed exclusively by Section 5 of Article IV of these By-Laws, and matters properly brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and included in the Corporation's notice of meeting) shall be conducted at any meeting of stockholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8 of Article III. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8 of Article III, and if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
(e) For purposes of this Section 8 of Article III and Section 5 of Article IV of these By-Laws, public disclosure shall be deemed to include a disclosure made in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Services, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
SECTION 9. . (a) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted by the DGCL to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting
(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request that the Board of Directors fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such written notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 9(b)). If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 9(b) or otherwise within ten (10) days after the date on which such written notice is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date after the expiration of such ten (10) day time period on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 9(b), the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and unrevoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 9 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9(c) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
(d) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days after the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 9, a valid written consent or valid written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section 9 and applicable law, and not revoked.
(e) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall, to the extent required by law, be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation. In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the DGCL other than Section 228 thereof, if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such other section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, and that written notice has been given as provided in such Section 228.

At each annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders shall elect directors.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, if the Chairman determines that a nomination of any candidate for election as a director was not made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5, such nomination shall be void.

The following summarizes the material terms of the common stock and undesignated preferred stock of American Tower Corporation (the "Company") as set forth in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Charter") and its Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws"). While we believe that the following description covers the material terms of Company's common stock, the following summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable Delaware law and to the Charter and By-Laws.
Authorized Capital
The Charter authorizes the Company to issue up to 1,020,000,000 shares of stock, consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share.
Common Stock
All shares of the Company's common stock will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Under Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), stockholders generally are not personally liable for a corporation's acts or debts.
. With respect to all matters upon which stockholders are entitled to vote, the holders of the Company's common stock will be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the Company's common stock outstanding in the name of such stockholders on the record of stockholders. Generally, all matters to be voted on by stockholders must be approved by a majority (or by a plurality in the case of election of directors where the number of candidates nominated for election exceeds the number of directors to be elected) of the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of the Company's common stock present in person or by proxy.
Voting Rights
. Subject to applicable law and rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over the Company's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends, dividends may be declared and paid on the Company's common stock from time to time and in amounts as the board of directors may determine. We anticipate initiating a regular quarterly dividend in 2012, but the amount, timing and frequency of any such distribution will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and will be declared based upon various factors, including without limitation distributions required to maintain REIT status. There is no certainty as to the timing or amount of any distribution.
Dividends
. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the holders of the Company's common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all assets available for distribution after payment in full to creditors and payment in full to holders of preferred stock then outstanding of any amount required to be paid to them. Neither the merger, consolidation or business combination of the Company with or into any other entity in which our stockholders receive capital stock and/or other securities (including debt securities) of the surviving entity (or the direct or indirect parent entity thereof), nor the sale, lease or transfer by us of any part of our business and assets, nor the reduction of our capital stock, will be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
Liquidation Rights
. The holders of the Company's common stock will have no preemptive, subscription or redemption rights and will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.
Other Provisions
The Company will not be permitted to subdivide, combine, or pay or declare any stock dividend on, the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock unless all outstanding shares of the Company's common stock are subdivided or combined or the holders of the Company's common stock receive a proportionate dividend.
Preferred Stock
Pursuant to the Charter, the board of directors is empowered, without any approval of our stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares in each series, and to fix the relative rights, preferences, powers, qualifications, limitations and restrictions of each such series. The specific matters that may be determined by the board of directors include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Currently, there are no shares of American Tower REIT preferred stock issued and outstanding.
Because the board of directors will have the power to establish the preferences and rights of each series of preferred stock, it may afford the stockholders of any series of preferred stock preferences, powers and rights senior to the rights of holders of shares of common stock which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company.
Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer
For us to comply with and have maximum business flexibility under the Federal Communications Laws (defined in the Charter and including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended), and for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Charter contains restrictions on stock ownership and stock transfers. Although the Federal Communications Laws restrictions are not material to our qualification as a REIT, they could be material to our business, results of operation, or financial condition.
All certificates representing shares of capital stock, if any, will bear legends describing or referring to both sets of restrictions. Further, these ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.
. The Charter permits us to restrict the ownership or proposed ownership of shares of the Company's common stock if such ownership or proposed ownership (i) is or could be inconsistent with, or in violation of, Federal Communications Laws (as defined in the Charter), (ii) limits or impairs or could limit or impair our business activities or proposed business activities under the Federal Communications Laws, or (iii) subjects or could subject us to CFIUS Review (as defined in the Charter) or to any provision of the
Federal Communications Laws Restrictions
Federal Communications Laws including those requiring any review, authorization or approval, to which we would not be subject but for such ownership or proposed ownership, including, without limitation, Section 310 of the Communications Act and regulations relating to foreign ownership, multiple ownership, or cross-ownership (the foregoing (i) through (iii) are collectively referred to as "FCC Regulatory Limitations"). We reserve the right to require any person to whom a FCC Regulatory Limitation may apply to promptly furnish to us such information (including, without limitation, information with respect to the citizenship, other ownership interests and affiliations) upon our request. If such person fails to furnish all of the information we request, or we conclude that such person's ownership or proposed ownership of the Company's common stock, or the exercise by such person of any rights of stock ownership in connection with the Company's common stock, may result in an FCC Regulatory Limitation, we reserve the right to:
 
 
 
 
 
  The following procedures apply to the redemption of such person's Company common stock and/or preferred stock:
 
 
 
 
 
 
. For us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, the Company's stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of the Company's stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer "individuals" (as defined in the Code to include certain entities such as private foundations) during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). To satisfy these ownership requirements and other requirements for continued qualification as a REIT and to otherwise protect us from the consequences of a concentration of ownership among the Company's stockholders, the Charter contains provisions restricting the ownership or transfer of shares of the Company's stock.
REIT Restrictions
The relevant sections of the Charter provide that, subject to the exceptions and the constructive ownership rules described below, no person (as defined in the Charter) may beneficially or constructively own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the Company's outstanding shares of stock, including the Company's common stock and preferred stock, or more than 9.8% in value or number (whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of any class or series of the Company's stock. We refer to these restrictions as the "ownership limits."
The applicable constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and/or entities to be treated as owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the Company's outstanding stock or less than 9.8% in value or number of the Company's outstanding shares of any class or series of stock (including through the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, any class or series of the Company's stock) by an individual or entity could nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own, constructively or beneficially, in excess of 9.8% in value of the Company's outstanding stock or 9.8% in value or number of the Company's outstanding shares of any class or series of stock.
In addition to the ownership limits, the Charter prohibits any person from actually or constructively owning shares of the Company's stock to the extent that such ownership would cause any of our income that would otherwise qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of Section 856(d) of the Code to fail to qualify as such.
The board of directors may, in its sole discretion, exempt a person from the ownership limits and certain other REIT limits on ownership and transfer of the Company's stock described above, and may establish a different limit on ownership for any such person. However, the board of directors may not exempt any person whose ownership of outstanding stock in violation of these limits would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT. In order to be considered by the board of directors for exemption or a different limit on ownership, a person must make such representations and undertakings as are reasonably necessary to ascertain that such person's beneficial or constructive ownership of the Company's stock will not now or in the future jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT under the Code and must agree that any violation or attempted violation of such representations or undertakings (or other action that is contrary to the ownership limits and certain other REIT limits on ownership and transfer of the Company's stock described above) will result in the shares of stock being automatically transferred to a trust as described below. As a condition of its waiver, the board of directors may require an opinion of counsel or IRS ruling satisfactory to the board of directors with respect to our qualification as a REIT and may impose such other conditions as it deems appropriate in connection with the granting of the exemption or a different limit on ownership.
In connection with the waiver of the ownership limits or at any other time, the board of directors may from time to time increase the ownership limits for one or more persons and decrease the ownership limits for all other persons; provided that the new ownership limits may not, after giving effect to such increase and under certain assumptions stated in the Charter, result in us being "closely held" within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interests are held during the last half of a taxable year). Reduced ownership limits will not apply to any person whose percentage ownership of the Company's total shares of stock or of the shares of a class or series of the Company's stock, as applicable, is in excess of such decreased ownership limits until such time as such person's percentage of total shares of stock or of the shares of a class or series of stock, as applicable, equals or falls below the decreased ownership limits, but any further acquisition of the Company's shares of stock or of the shares of a class or series of the Company's stock, as applicable, in excess of such percentage ownership of shares of stock or of a class or series of stock will be in violation of the ownership limits.
The Charter further prohibits:
 
 
The foregoing provisions on transferability and ownership will not apply if the board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT.
Any person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of the Company's stock that will or may violate the ownership limits or any of the other foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will be required to give notice to us immediately (or, in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction, at least 15 days prior to such transaction) and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such transfer on our qualification as a REIT.
Pursuant to the Charter, if there is any purported transfer of the Company's stock or other event or change of circumstances that, if effective or otherwise, would violate any of the restrictions described above, then the number of shares causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) will be automatically transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, except that any transfer that results in the violation of the restriction relating to the Company's stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons will be automatically void and of no force or effect. The automatic transfer will be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the purported transfer or other event or change of circumstances that requires the transfer to the trust. We refer below to the person that would have owned the shares if they had not been transferred to the trust as the purported transferee. Any ordinary dividend paid to the purported transferee, prior to our discovery that the shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above, must be repaid to the trustee upon demand. The Charter also provides for adjustments to the entitlement to receive extraordinary dividends and other distributions as between the purported transferee and the trust. If the transfer to the trust as described above is not automatically effective, for any reason, to prevent violation of the applicable restriction contained in the Charter, then the transfer of the excess shares will be automatically void and of no force or effect.
Shares of the Company's stock transferred to the trustee are deemed to be offered for sale to us or our designee at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the trust or, if the purported transferee did not give value for the shares in connection with the event causing the shares to be held in trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the market price at the time of such event and (ii) the market price on the date we accept, or our designee accepts, such offer. We have the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of the Company's stock held in the trust pursuant to the clauses discussed below. Upon a sale to us, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold terminates and the trustee must distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the purported transferee, except that the trustee may reduce the amount payable to the purported transferee by the amount of any ordinary dividends that we paid to the purported transferee prior to our discovery that the shares had been transferred to the trust and that is owed by the purported transferee to the trustee as described above. Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the purported transferee shall be immediately paid to the charitable beneficiary, and any ordinary dividends held by the trustee with respect to such stock will be paid to the charitable beneficiary.
If we do not buy the shares, the trustee must, as soon as reasonably practicable (and, if the shares are listed on a national securities exchange, within 20 days) after receiving notice from us of the transfer of shares to the trust, sell the shares to a person or entity who could own the shares without violating the restrictions described above. Upon such a sale, the trustee must distribute to the purported transferee an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the price paid by the purported transferee for the shares or, if the purported transferee did not give value for the shares in connection with the event causing the shares to be held in trust (e.g., in the case of a gift, devise or other such transaction), the market price of the shares on the day of the event causing the shares to be held in the trust, and (ii) the sales proceeds (net of commissions and other expenses of sale) received by the trustee for the shares. The trustee may reduce the amount payable to the purported transferee by the amount of any ordinary dividends that we paid to the purported transferee before our discovery that the shares had been transferred to the trust and that is owed by the purported transferee to the trustee as described above. Any net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the purported transferee will be immediately paid to the charitable beneficiary, together with any ordinary dividends held by the trustee with respect to such stock. In addition, if prior to discovery by us that shares of the Company's common stock have been transferred to a trust, such shares of stock are sold by a purported transferee, then such shares will be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and, to the extent that the purported transferee received an amount for or in respect of such shares that exceeds the amount that such purported transferee was entitled to receive as described above, such excess amount shall be paid to the trustee upon demand. The purported transferee has no rights in the shares held by the trustee.
The trustee will be indemnified by us or from the proceeds of sales of stock in the trust for its costs and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with conducting its duties and satisfying its obligations under the Charter. The trustee will also be entitled to reasonable compensation for services provided as determined by
agreement between the trustee and the board of directors, which compensation may be funded by us or the trust. If we pay any such indemnification or compensation, we are entitled on a first priority basis (subject to the trustee's indemnification and compensation rights) to be reimbursed from the trust. To the extent the trust funds any such indemnification and compensation, the amounts available for payment to a purported transferee (or the charitable beneficiary) would be reduced.
The trustee will be designated by us and must be unaffiliated with us and with any purported transferee. Prior to the sale of any shares by the trust, the trustee will receive, in trust for the beneficiary, all distributions paid by us with respect to the shares, and may also exercise all voting rights with respect to the shares.
Subject to DGCL, effective as of the date that the shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee will have the authority, at the trustee's sole discretion:
 
 
However, if we have already taken corporate action, then the trustee may not rescind and recast the vote.
In addition, if the board of directors determines that a proposed or purported transfer would violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company's stock set forth in the Charter, the board of directors may take such action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such violation, including but not limited to, causing us to repurchase shares of the Company's stock, refusing to give effect to the transfer on our books or instituting proceedings to enjoin the transfer.
Following the end of each taxable year, every owner of 5% or more (or such lower percentage as required by the Code or the Treasury regulations thereunder) of the outstanding shares of any class or series of the Company's stock, must, upon request, provide us written notice of the person's name and address, the number of shares of each class and series of the Company's stock that the person beneficially owns and a description of the manner in which the shares are held. Each such owner must also provide us with such additional information as we may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such owner's beneficial ownership on our qualification as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limits. In addition, each beneficial owner or constructive owner of the Company's stock, and any person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding shares of the Company's stock for a beneficial owner or constructive owner will, upon demand, be required to provide us with such information as we may request in good faith in order to determine our qualification as a REIT and to comply with the requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance.
Listing of Common Stock
The Company's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AMT."
Transfer Agent and Registrar
The transfer agent and registrar for the Company's common stock is The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 525 William Penn Place, 7th Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15259, telephone number (412) 234-7571.
Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions
We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of DGCL. Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. A "business combination" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within the prior three years owned, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock.
Delaware Business Combination Provisions.
Our By-Laws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election of directors, other than nominations made by, or at the direction of, our board of directors. These procedures may impede stockholders' ability to bring matters before a meeting of stockholders or make nominations for directors at a meeting of stockholders.
Certain Provisions of our Charter and By-Laws.
Our Charter includes provisions eliminating the personal liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and indemnifying our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our Charter may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though a derivative action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition, the value of investments in our securities may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
Our Charter provides that any or all of the directors may be removed at any time, either with or without cause, by a vote of a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote. This provision may delay or prevent our stockholders from removing incumbent directors. The ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our Charter, and described above, may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
Our Charter and our By-Laws provide that our By-Laws may be altered, amended, changed or repealed by (i) the approval or consent of not less than a majority of the total outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors or (ii) a majority of the entire board of directors.
Change of control and merger, consolidation and asset sale provisions in our indentures for our outstanding notes and loan agreements for our credit facilities may discourage a takeover attempt. These provisions may make acquiring us more difficult.
Certain Provisions of our Debt Obligations.

THE COMPANY WILL FURNISH WITHOUT CHARGE TO EACH STOCKHOLDER WHO SO REQUESTS, A SUMMARY OF THE POWERS, DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RELATIVE, PARTICIPATING, OPTIONAL OR OTHER SPECIAL RIGHTS OF EACH CLASS OF STOCK OF THE COMPANY AND THE QUALIFICATIONS, LIMITATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF SUCH PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS, AND THE VARIATIONS IN RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS DETERMINED FOR EACH SERIES, WHICH ARE FIXED BY THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY AND THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DETERMINE VARIATIONS FOR FUTURE SERIES.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY REQUIRE THE OWNER OF A LOST OR DESTROYED STOCK CERTIFICATE, OR HIS LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES, TO GIVE THE COMPANY A BOND TO INDEMNIFY IT AND ITS TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS AGAINST ANY CLAIM THAT MAY BE MADE AGAINST THEM ON ACCOUNT OF THE ALLEGED LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF ANY SUCH CERTIFICATE.

By your signature below, you agree with the Company to the terms of this Agreement.
 
1. . The provisions of the Plan are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement by this reference. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan. The Committee administers the Plan, and its determinations regarding the interpretation and operation of the Plan and this Agreement are final and binding. The Board may in its sole discretion at any time terminate or from time to time modify and amend the Plan as provided therein. You may obtain a copy of the Plan without charge upon request to the Company's Human Resources Department.
Plan Incorporated by Reference
2. . The RSUs will vest, while you are employed by the Company or one of its Affiliates, for the respective numbers of shares and on the scheduled vesting dates stated in the vesting schedule on the first page of this Agreement, subject to the other terms hereof. RSUs are an unfunded, unsecured obligation of the Company. You shall not earn any rights under the RSUs except in conformity with such schedule and until all other conditions that are required to be met in order to issue the underlying shares have been satisfied. Subject to Section 6, within sixty (60) days after the scheduled vesting date for any RSUs, the Company will deliver to you or your legal representative the number of shares underlying the number of vested RSUs associated with such scheduled vesting date on the vesting schedule (or such cash or other property as the Committee determines).
Vesting of RSUs
3. . While the RSUs are outstanding and unvested, the Company will accrue dividend equivalents on your behalf. The dividend equivalent with respect to each RSU will be equal to the sum of the cash dividend declared and paid by the Company with respect to each share of Stock while the RSU is outstanding (but not dividends declared and paid before January 1, 2012). No interest will accrue on the dividend equivalents. The dividend equivalents with respect to each RSU shall be earned and paid out in cash at the same time as the RSU is earned and paid out.
Dividend Equivalents
4. . Upon termination of your employment with the Company and its Affiliates for any reason, any of the RSUs that are unvested as of the termination date, together with any accrued dividend equivalents, will be canceled for no value. Authorized leave of absence or absence on military or government service shall not constitute termination of your employment for this purpose so long as either (a) such absence is for a period of no more than 90 calendar days or (b) your right to re-employment after such absence is guaranteed either by statute or by contract.
Termination of RSUs
5. . Upon the vesting of the RSUs, the Company shall withhold from issuance in settlement of such RSUs the number of shares of Stock necessary to satisfy the minimum tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting with such shares of Stock valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of withholding; provided, that the Company may permit, at the discretion of the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, or the Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, a holder of RSUs to pay the associated tax withholding obligations to the Company in cash (in lieu of the Company withholding shares of Stock), if such holder submits a written request therefor in advance of the vesting date for such RSUs and remits to the Company such payment no later than the date of delivery of the remaining shares to the holder in settlement of the RSUs. Withholding from dividend equivalents will be made by the Company in cash.
Withholding Taxes
6. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you shall be obligated to (a) transfer to the Company any shares, cash or other property previously issued upon vesting of RSUs and dividend equivalents and (b) pay to the Company all gains realized by any person from the disposition of any such shares or other property if: (I) your employment with the Company or any Affiliate is terminated for cause or (II) following termination of employment for any reason, either (A) the Company determines that you engaged in conduct while an employee that would have justified termination for cause or (B) you violate any applicable confidentiality or non-competition agreement with the Company or any Affiliate. Termination for cause means criminal conduct involving a felony in the U.S. or the equivalent of a felony under the laws of other countries, material violations of civil law related to your job responsibilities, fraud, dishonesty, self-dealing, breach of your obligations regarding the Company's intellectual property, or willful misconduct that the Committee determines to be injurious to the Company.
Termination; Forfeiture
 
7. . The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Stock or other securities upon vesting of the RSUs unless the Company is satisfied that all requirements of law or any applicable stock exchange in connection therewith (including without limitation the effective registration or exemption of the issuance of such shares or other securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws) have been or will be complied with, and the Committee may impose any restrictions on your rights as it shall deem necessary or advisable to comply with any such requirements; provided that the Company will issue such shares or other securities on the earliest date at which it reasonably anticipates that such issuance will not cause such violation . You further agree hereby that, as a condition to the issuance of shares upon vesting of the RSUs, you will enter into and perform any underwriter's lock-up agreement requested by the Company from time to time in connection with public offerings of the Company's securities.
Compliance with Law; Lock-Up Agreement
8. . You shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Stock or other securities covered by the RSUs until the issuance of such actual shares of Stock or other securities.
Rights as Stockholder
9. . Neither the adoption, maintenance or operation of the Plan nor the award of the RSUs and the dividend equivalents with respect to the RSUs confers upon you any right to continue your employment with the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall they interfere with the rights of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate or otherwise change the terms of such employment or service at any time, including, without limitation, the right to promote, demote or reassign you from one position to another in the Company or any Affiliate. Unless the Committee otherwise provides in any case, your employment with an Affiliate shall be deemed to terminate for purposes of the Plan when such Affiliate ceases to be an Affiliate of the Company.
Effect on Your Employment
10. . You may not assign or transfer the RSUs or any rights with respect thereto, including without limitation, the dividend equivalents with respect to the RSUs, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or to the extent expressly permitted in writing by the Committee.
Nontransferability
11. . The terms of the RSUs and the dividend equivalents with respect to the RSUs may be changed without your consent as provided in the Plan upon a change in control of, or certain other corporate events affecting, the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the number and kind of shares or other securities or property issuable upon vesting of the RSUs may be changed, the vesting schedule may be accelerated, the RSUs may be assumed by another issuer, or the RSUs may be terminated, as the Committee may consider equitable to the participants in the Plan and in the best interests of the Company.
Corporate Events
12. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the applicable laws of the United States of America and the law (other than the law governing conflict of law questions) of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts except to the extent the laws of any other jurisdiction are mandatorily applicable.
Governing Law
13. . The RSUs and the dividend equivalents with respect to the RSUs may be amended or terminated by the Company with or without your consent, as permitted by the Plan.
