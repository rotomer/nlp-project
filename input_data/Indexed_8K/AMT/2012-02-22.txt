(e) On February 17, 2012, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation (the "Company") considered the compensation arrangements with the Company's executive officers. The information in the table below sets forth the determinations of the Compensation Committee with respect to base salaries and cash bonus incentive targets for the year ending December 31, 2012 for the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers who were serving as executive officers on December 31, 2011 (collectively, the "Current Named Executive Officers").
 
In determining annual cash bonus incentive payments for the Company's Current Named Executive Officers at the end of the year, the Compensation Committee bases its decisions on a number of factors, including the Company's financial performance, the achievement of certain strategic goals and each executive's contribution to the Company's overall performance. If the Company exceeds its goals and/or the executive exceeds his or her goals, the annual cash bonus incentive could be subject to increase at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, up to a maximum of 200% of the executive's bonus target. Additional information regarding compensation of the executive officers listed above will be included in the Company's 2012 Proxy Statement when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
