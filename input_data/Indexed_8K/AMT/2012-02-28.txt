This amendment corrects an immaterial error contained in American Tower Corporation's (the "Company") earnings release issued on February 23, 2012 that reported the operating results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2011. That earnings release incorrectly excluded approximately $3.8 million from net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011. Accordingly, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest increased from $4.9 million to $8.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, and from $10.8 million to $14.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2011. The Company's net income attributable to American Tower Corporation increased by $3.8 million, or $0.01 per share, to $205.1 million, or $0.52 per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011, and to $396.5 million, or $1.00 and $0.99 per basic and diluted share, respectively, for the full year ended December 31, 2011. Further, accumulated deficit and noncontrolling interest as of December 31, 2011 decreased to $1,477.9 million and $122.9 million, respectively, and total American Tower Corporation stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2011 increased to $3,287.2 million. There are no other changes to the original presentation.
The Company is furnishing herewith as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 revised financial tables reflecting these corrections, with the changes to the previously released tables highlighted.
