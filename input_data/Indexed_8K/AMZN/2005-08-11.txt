ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
On August 11, 2005, Amazon.com announced that it has entered into a settlement with Soverain Software, LLC of a lawsuit alleging patent infringement by Amazon.com. The litigation was settled on terms that include, among other things, a one-time payment of $40 million in third quarter 2005, dismissal of all claims and counterclaims, mutual releases, and a non-exclusive license to Soverain's patent portfolio. Amazon.com expects to record a previously unanticipated charge to "Other operating expense" of up to $40 million in third quarter 2005 in connection with this settlement. The litigation was originally filed on January 12, 2004 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
