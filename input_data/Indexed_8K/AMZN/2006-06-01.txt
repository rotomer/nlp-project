ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
As previously reported, we are appealing a recent court decision that terminates our Toysrus.com contract. The Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court has denied our motion to stay the termination pending a decision on our appeal.
While we believe we will prevail on the appeal and that Toysrus.com's claims lack merit, the timing and possible outcome of this litigation are uncertain and the possible effects of termination were not reflected in our financial guidance contained in our April 25, 2006 press release. As indicated in that release, since we did not prevail on our stay motion, operating profit could be negatively impacted by as much as $50 million for 2006 and $25 million for the second quarter 2006, much of which is due to Toysrus.com's failure to pay fees for the second quarter.
