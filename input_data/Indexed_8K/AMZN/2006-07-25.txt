Exhibit 99.1
AMAZON.COM ANNOUNCES 22% SALES GROWTH FUELED BY LOWER PRICES, FREE SHIPPING; AMAZON PRIME MEMBERSHIPS MORE THAN DOUBLE FROM YEAR END; RAISES TOP LINE AND LOWERS BOTTOM LINE GUIDANCE; WILL INVEST HEAVILY IN TOY CATEGORY IN BACK HALF OF YEAR
SEATTLE(BUSINESS WIRE)July 25, 2006Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2006.
Operating cash flow declined 2% to $610 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $624 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2005. Free cash flow decreased 23% to $375 million for the trailing twelve months, compared with $486 million for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2005. The primary driver of the free cash flow decline was our increased expenditure in technology and content. Free cash flow was also reduced by a $40 million patent litigation settlement in third quarter 2005, $34 million from excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation now classified as financing cash flows, and investments in additional fulfillment capacity.
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards outstanding totaled 443 million at June 30, 2006, compared with 438 million a year ago.
Net sales increased 22% to $2.14 billion in the second quarter, compared with $1.75 billion in second quarter 2005. Excluding the $24 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales grew 23% compared with second quarter 2005.
Operating income decreased 55% to $47 million in the second quarter, compared with $104 million in second quarter 2005. The decline in operating income was mainly due to technology and content investments, lower prices including free shipping and Amazon Prime, and $20 million from a contract termination and related fee dispute.
Net income was $22 million in the second quarter, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $52 million, or $0.12 per diluted share in second quarter 2005.
"We're investing in Amazon Prime and future technology initiatives" said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com. "Amazon Prime gets customers their products fast, and our investments in technology position us to innovate in seller platforms, web services, and digital. We're looking forward to the coming decrease in our year-over-year growth rates in technology spending in the second half of 2006."
Amazon Prime, Amazon.com's first-ever membership program, was introduced in February 2005. For a flat membership fee of $79 per year, Amazon Prime members get unlimited, express two-day shipping for free, with no minimum purchase requirement on over a million eligible items sold by Amazon.com. Members can order as late as 6:30 p.m. ET and still get their order the next day for only $3.99 per item, and they can share the benefits of Amazon Prime with up to four family members living in their household.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of July 25, 2006.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company's financial and operating results.
.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains and develops commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risk of future losses, significant indebtedness, system interruptions, consumer trends, limited operating history, government regulation and taxation, fraud, and new business areas. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com's financial results is included in Amazon.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, and all subsequent filings

Exhibit 99.2
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, , and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our measure of "Free cash flow" meets the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Free cash flow, which we reconcile to "Net cash provided by operating activities," is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purchases of fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development." We use free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flows since purchases of fixed assets are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.
Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
In addition, we provide operating expenses with and without stock-based compensation. We provide this information to show the impact of stock-based compensation, which is non-cash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance (although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly). In addition, unlike other centrally-incurred operating costs, stock-based compensation is not allocated to segment results and therefore excluding it from operating expense is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements.
Operating expenses without stock-based compensation have limitations due to the fact that they do not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce. More specifically, if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, our cash salary expense included in the "Fulfillment", "Technology and content", "Marketing", and "General and administrative" line items would be higher. We compensate for this limitation by providing supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements. Stock-based compensation programs are an important element of the company's compensation structure and all forms of stock-based awards are valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.
For a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow and the other non-GAAP financial measures referred to above to the most directly comparable amounts reported in accordance with GAAP, see "Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics" and "Financial and Operational Summary" in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
