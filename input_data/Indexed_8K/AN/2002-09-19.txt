I felt it was time for me to scale back my involvement at AutoNation and focus my attention towards new entrepreneurial opportunities. I am confident of Mike's abilities and proud of the company's performance. The succession to Mike Jackson is well-timed considering his knowledge and experience and the strength of AutoNation. Mike is a proven leader and over the past three years as CEO, he has shown no one has a better understanding of automotive retail.
