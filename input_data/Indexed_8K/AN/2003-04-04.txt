(APRIL 4, 2003) --- AUTONATION, INC. (NYSE: AN), today announced that it is evaluating alternatives for engaging an independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003. AutoNation's Audit Committee, which is responsible for appointing the Company's independent auditor, made the decision due to the recent announcement by Deloitte & Touche that it had ended efforts to separate Deloitte Consulting, which provides services to AutoNation. Also, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, audit firms will be precluded from providing certain non-audit services to their clients. When AutoNation appointed Deloitte & Touche as its independent auditor in May 2002, Deloitte & Touche had planned to separate its consulting business by year-end 2002. AutoNation intends to continue its relationship with Deloitte & Touche's consulting business. Deloitte & Touche will continue as AutoNation's independent auditor while AutoNation completes its evaluation. There have been no disagreements between AutoNation and Deloitte & Touche.
