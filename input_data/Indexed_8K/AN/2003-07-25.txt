(July 24, 2003) --- AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN), America's largest retailer of both new and used vehicles, today reported record second-quarter earnings per share of $0.37, 16% above a year-earlier $0.32 per share, driven by initiatives aimed at maximizing operating efficiencies that allowed the Company to further leverage its cost structure and the continued repurchase of outstanding shares. The Company reported operating income of $207 million and net income of $106 million, increases of 5% and 2%, respectively. Total revenue for the second-quarter ended June 30, 2003 increased to $5.1 billion compared to $5.0 billion a year ago driven by revenue growth of 4% for new vehicles and 6% for finance and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) was $549 million or 71.1% as a percentage of total gross profit, a 110 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Commenting on the second-quarter performance AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation delivered another record quarter of earnings per share coupled with increases in revenue and net income, demonstrating the strength of our operation and the commitment of our team. We benefited from the continued success of our cost containment initiatives and operational improvements, particularly in the area of new and used vehicles and finance and insurance, allowing us to expand our operating margin." Other highlights in the second quarter include: o The repurchase of 10.4 million of the Company's outstanding shares at a cost of $149 million. o Record finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed of $804. o The successful launch of two market brands, Power in Southern California and Champion in Houston, Austin and Corpus Christi; bringing the Company's number of branded markets to 13. o The appointment of two new board members: Alan S.

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, the Company earned net income from continuing operations of $318 million or $1.10 per share. Excluding the benefit of the first quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.66, a 10% increase versus the prior year. The Company's revenue for the six-month period totaled $9.5 billion, down 2% versus the prior year. AutoNation also announced that it will now report new vehicle days supply utilizing the industry standard of selling days inclusive of fleet. Prior to this change, the Company reported new vehicle days supply using calendar days excluding fleet, which at the end of the second quarter stood at 72 days. Using the industry metric, the Company's new vehicle inventory at the end of the second quarter was 65 days, compared to the industry at 63 days. Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "While we are hopeful that efforts to stimulate the economy will take hold, we believe that the auto retail environment will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance this quarter, we are raising our full-year 2003 outlook for earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.07 to the range of $1.28 to $1.33, excluding the benefit of the first quarter tax settlement, and offer third-quarter earnings per share guidance of $0.34 to $0.36." The Company's earnings outlook for the full year on a GAAP basis is $1.72 to $1.77 per share from continuing operations. The reconciliation of the Company's earnings estimate is set forth in the table below: Revised full-year guidance $1.28 - $1.33 Q1 2003 income tax benefit from IRS settlement $0.44 ------------- Expected 2003 full-year GAAP EPS from continuing operations $1.72 - $1.77 ============= AutoNation will discuss these results, the Company's outlook and supporting assumptions during a conference call and audio webcast this morning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
