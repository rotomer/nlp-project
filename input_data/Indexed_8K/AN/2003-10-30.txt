ITEM 12. INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER ITEM 12 (RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION)
On October 30, 2003, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. The text of the press release is reproduced below and the Company's Quarterly Financial Data Supplement for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 is attached as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
     (NYSE: AN), America's largest retailer of both new and used vehicles, today reported record third quarter earnings per share of $0.38, 15% above a year-earlier $0.33 per share, driven by the continued repurchase of outstanding shares and initiatives aimed at maximizing operating efficiencies that allowed the Company to further leverage its cost structure. The Company reported net income of $109 million, an increase of 2% over a year ago.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (October 30, 2003) - AutoNation, Inc.
     Total revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 increased to $5.3 billion compared to $5.2 billion a year ago, driven by revenue growth of 3% for new vehicles, 2% for parts and service, and 7% for finance and insurance. Third quarter vehicle sales were positively impacted due to the accelerated demand in California in anticipation of a substantial increase in the California vehicle license fee on October 1. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) was $566 million or 71.6% of total gross profit, a 110 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Operating income was $206 million, an increase of 3.5% over a year ago, and as a percent of gross profit improved 60 basis points to 26.1%.
     Commenting on the third quarter results AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "Once again, AutoNation delivered solid performance in the quarter as we continued our operational improvements and cost containment. We were pleased to achieve a record for F&I profit per vehicle retailed, gains in our parts and service business and a positive trend in our used vehicle business. Our strategy remains the same. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals, leveraging our cost structure and allocating our capital appropriately among stock repurchase, acquisitions and capital investments."
 
     For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $427 million or $1.48 per share. Excluding the $0.44 per share benefit of the first quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.04, a 12% increase versus the prior year. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period totaled $14.8 billion, down 1% versus the prior year.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "Auto manufacturers have effectively kept consumers in the marketplace with innovative product and strong incentives. AutoNation's fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is $0.27 to $0.29 from our core business. We are maintaining full year earnings per share guidance at $1.31 to $1.33, the upper end of our previous range. This excludes the benefits of the Company's first quarter tax settlement and fourth quarter items related to favorable state income tax settlements and the gain on the sale of a non-core equity investment."
     The Company's earnings outlook on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter is $0.32 to $0.34 per share and for the full year 2003 is $1.80 to $1.82 per share from continuing operations. The reconciliation of the Company's earnings estimate is set forth in the table below:
     Commenting on the Company's outlook for 2004, Mr. Jackson said, "We anticipate that the 2004 new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in a stable volume environment. Our full year 2004 EPS outlook is $1.40 - $1.45."
