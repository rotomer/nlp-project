ITEM 12. INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER ITEM 12 (RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION)
On February 5, 2004, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003. The text of the press release is reproduced below and the Company's Quarterly Financial Data Supplement for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 is attached as an exhibit hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
      (NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2003 fourth-quarter net income of $79.0 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to year-ago net income of $79.4 million or $0.26 per share. The 8% increase in fourth-quarter earnings per share was driven by further leverage of its cost structure and the continued repurchase of outstanding shares.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (February 5, 2004) - AutoNation, Inc.
     Fourth-quarter 2003 revenue totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $77 million compared to the year-ago period resulting from revenue growth in new vehicles of 4%, parts and service of 1% and finance and insurance of 8%. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in the quarter was $520.3 million or 75.1% of total gross profit, a 100 basis point improvement compared to a year ago. Operating income in the quarter was $130.7 million, a reduction of 16% compared to a year ago resulting from a real estate impairment charge of $27.5 million ($16.9 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) related to three franchised new vehicle stores that currently operate in converted used vehicle megastores. Excluding the effect of the impairment, operating income in the quarter was $158.2 million, an increase of $3 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. The real estate impairment was offset by a gain of $10.2 million ($6.2 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) recognized by the Company on the sale of a non-core equity investment as well as a net income tax benefit of $10.3 million or $0.04 per share related primarily to favorable tax adjustments and settlements.
 
     Commenting on fourth-quarter 2003 performance AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation's performance in the fourth quarter was characterized by continued cost containment and revenue growth resulting from ongoing operational improvements. We were pleased to deliver our eighth consecutive quarter-over-quarter record EPS from continuing operations."
     For the full year, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $506.1 million or $1.76 per share. Excluding the $0.44 per share benefit from the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.32, an 11% increase versus the prior year. The Company's revenue for the full year totaled $19.4 billion, down less than 1% versus the prior year.
     The Company's 2003 accomplishments included:
     Commenting on the Company's 2003 performance and the year ahead, Jackson said, "In a highly competitive environment where industry sales were down, we once again delivered double-digit EPS growth. Looking ahead, we maintain our outlook that the 2004 new vehicle market will remain intensely competitive in a stable volume environment. We confirm our full-year 2004 EPS guidance of $1.40 to $1.45 and expect first-quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.29 to $0.31."
