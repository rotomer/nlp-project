Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (April 29, 2004)  AutoNation, Inc.
     The first-quarter $0.32 EPS exceeded the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.30 per share. Across-the-board growth in both revenue and gross profit coupled with continued share repurchase and leverage of the company's cost structure drove performance in the quarter. Commenting on the quarter, Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer of AutoNation, stated, "AutoNation delivered strong same store sales results in the first quarter in every area of the business, including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance and parts and service. We also continued to make strides on the cost side of the equation. It was a great quarter and we're very pleased with our results."
     First quarter highlights include:
 
     Looking ahead, Jackson said, "We are encouraged by our ability to generate top line growth, our continued cost reductions and the disciplined redeployment of our significant cash flow to improve shareholder value. Given this, we are raising our full-year 2004 EPS guidance by $0.03 to the range of $1.43 to $1.48 and anticipate second-quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.38 to $0.40."
