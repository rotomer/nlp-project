Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (July 8, 2004)  AutoNation, Inc.
     "A number of factors directly impacted our second quarter earnings," said Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AutoNation. "Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volume levels that did not materialize, particularly in June, with significant declines in sales of Ford and General Motors products. Low volume when combined with high inventories also caused a gross margin decline in our new vehicle business."
     Looking ahead, Jackson said, "Although the second quarter earnings were disappointing, our cash flow is strong and our strategy sound. However, in light of the second quarter results and the difficult new vehicle retail environment that we are operating in, we now anticipate 2004 EPS from continuing operations in the range of $1.35 to $1.40."
     Second quarter results are subject to the completion of customary quarterly financial closing and review procedures. AutoNation will release financial results for the 2nd Quarter ended June 30, 2004, on Tuesday, July 20, 2004 before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
