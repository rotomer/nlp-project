      America's largest automotive retailer, today reported net income from continuing operations of $96 million, or $0.35 per share, on revenue of $5.0 billion for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. The results compare with 2003 second-quarter net income from continuing operations of $107 million, or $0.37 per share, on revenue of $5.0 billion.

Fort Lauderdale, FL (July 20, 2004)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     "As previously announced, a number of factors directly impacted the company's second-quarter earnings," said Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer of AutoNation. "Our cost structure was targeted for vehicle sales volume levels that did not materialize, particularly in June, with significant declines in sales of Ford and General Motors products. Low volume when combined with high inventories also caused a gross margin decline in our new vehicle business." The decline in new and used vehicle gross profit was partially offset by improved gross profit performances in parts and service and finance and insurance.
     "The economic environment for American retailers in the month of June was particularly challenging, led by a 1.1% decline in retail sales, the largest drop in 16 months," said Jackson. "The automotive retail component of that decline was significant; the industry reported a 4.3% decrease, a notable falloff when compared to May's 3.2% gain."
     For the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, the Company earned net income from continuing operations of $184 million or $0.67 per share. Net income from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 was $1.10 per share. Excluding the $0.44 per share benefit of the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement, earnings per share from continuing operations
 
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 was $0.66. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 totaled $9.7 billion, up 4 percent versus the prior year.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Jackson said, "Although the second quarter earnings were disappointing, our cash flow is strong and our strategy sound. We expect to report third-quarter EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.36 to $0.38 per share. As previously announced, in light of the second-quarter results and the difficult new vehicle environment that we are operating in, our full-year 2004 guidance for EPS from continuing operations is in the range of $1.35 to $1.40."

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements and information included in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, estimates and expectations is contained in the Company's SEC filings. The Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, including its earnings outlook. This release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, including earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 excluding the benefit of the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement. The Company believes such non-GAAP financial measure improves the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provides a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improves the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided a reconciliation of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which is set forth in the attachments to this release.
 
 
 
Note
The Company's parts and service departments provide reconditioning repair work for used vehicles acquired by the used vehicle department and minor preparatory work for new vehicles. The parts and service departments charge the new and used departments as if they were third parties in order to account for total activity performed by that department. The Company has determined that the revenue and related cost of sales of both new and used vehicles had not been reduced by the intracompany charge for such work. Commencing with the second quarter of 2004, the Company is making the adjustment and has revised amounts previously reported by reducing new and used vehicle revenue and cost of sales by the amount of the intracompany charge. The adjustments have no impact on gross profit, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, or financial position for any period or their respective trends.
The effect of the adjustments was to reduce both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $22 million and $44 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively, and for used vehicles by $52 million and $102 million for the same periods, respectively. For 2003, the adjustment reduced both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $21 million and $40 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2003, respectively, and used vehicles by $49 million and $94 million for the same periods, respectively. Accordingly, the Company's revenue-based performance metrics, such as revenue per vehicle, gross profit as a percent of revenue, and SG&A as a percent of revenue, also have been revised. These revisions do not have a material impact on the amounts for any period or respective trends.
