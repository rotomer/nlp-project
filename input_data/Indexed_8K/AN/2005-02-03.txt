(NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2004 fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations of $116 million or $0.43 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $87 million or $0.31 per share. Excluding certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's fourth-quarter EPS from continuing operations of $0.34 increased 17% on a comparable basis from $0.29 in 2003, primarily as a result of strong revenue growth, continued leverage of the Company's cost structure, acquisitions and the repurchase of outstanding shares.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (February 3, 2005)  AutoNation, Inc.
     Fourth-quarter 2004 revenue totaled $4.8 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to the year-ago period resulting from revenue growth in new vehicles of 8%, retail used vehicles of 10%, parts and service of 7% and finance and insurance of 12%. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in the quarter was $534 million or 70.8% of total gross profit. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $193 million, a fourth quarter record. Excluding certain items for 2003 disclosed in the attached financial tables, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 21%.
     Commenting on fourth-quarter 2004 performance AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation's performance in the fourth quarter was driven by strong revenue growth resulting from ongoing operational enhancements and an improved industry environment, along with continued improvements in our industry-leading cost structure and the benefit of a streamlined regional management structure. In addition, our Florida and Southeast markets performed extremely well as they recovered from four hurricanes that affected third-quarter results."
     At the end of the fourth-quarter 2004, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 53 days versus 71 days at the end of the fourth-quarter 2003, representing a decline of 17,000 units, or 18%.
     The Company's fourth-quarter results reflect the resolution of various tax matters under audit from prior years, resulting in a $0.09 per share benefit in continuing operations and a $0.19 per share benefit in discontinued operations for the quarter.
 
     For full-year 2004, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $396 million or $1.45 per share, compared to $515 million or $1.80 per share in 2003, which included a $0.44 per share benefit from the first-quarter 2003 IRS tax settlement. Excluding the effect of this and certain other items disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's 2004 EPS from continuing operations of $1.36 increased 2% on a comparable basis from $1.33 in 2003. The Company's revenue for the full year totaled $19.4 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year.
     The Company's 2004 accomplishments included:
     Commenting on the Company's 2004 performance and the year ahead, Jackson said, "In a highly competitive and volatile environment, AutoNation was able to grow top-line revenue. Looking ahead, we believe that in 2005 industry sales of new vehicles will be nearly 17 million units for the seventh year in a row."

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
     
Certain statements and information included in this release constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Additional discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, estimates and expectations is contained in the Company's SEC filings. The Company undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements, including its earnings outlook. This release and the attached financial tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, including operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, adjusted in each case to exclude certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are set forth in the attachments to this release. The Company believes that each of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures improves the transparency of the Company's disclosure, provides a meaningful presentation of the Company's results from its core business operations excluding the impact of items not related to the Company's ongoing core business operations, and improves the period-to-period comparability of the Company's results from its core business operations.
 
 
 
 
Business Assumptions Impacting Long-term Average EPS Growth Target of 10% to 12%:
Note
The Company's parts and service departments provide reconditioning repair work for used vehicles acquired by the used vehicle department and minor preparatory work for new vehicles. The parts and service departments charge the new and used departments as if they were third parties in order to account for total activity performed by that department. The Company has determined that the revenue and related cost of sales of both new and used vehicles had not been reduced by the intracompany charge for such work. Commencing with the second quarter of 2004, the Company is making the adjustment and has revised amounts previously reported by reducing new and used vehicle revenue and cost of sales by the amount of the intracompany charge. The adjustments have no impact on total gross profit, operating income, income from continuing operations, net income, earnings per share, cash flows, or financial position for any period or their respective trends.
The effect of the adjustments was to reduce both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $19 million and $84 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2004, respectively, and for used vehicles by $45 million and $195 million for the same periods, respectively. For 2003, the adjustment reduced both revenue and cost of sales for new vehicles by $19 million and $82 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003, respectively, and used vehicles by $45 million and $190 million for the same periods, respectively. Accordingly, the Company's revenue-based performance metrics, such as revenue per vehicle, gross profit as a percent of revenue, and SG&A as a percent of revenue, also have been revised. These revisions do not have a material impact on the amounts for any period or respective trends.
