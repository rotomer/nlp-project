This Agreement shall terminate on the Facility Termination Date, except that (x) those provisions which by the express terms thereof continue in effect notwithstanding the Facility Termination Date, and (y) obligations in the nature of continuing indemnities or expense reimbursement obligations not yet due and payable, shall continue in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after receipt of any payment of all or any part of the Obligations, the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender (including the Swing Line lender) is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment to any Person because such payment is determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, a diversion of trust funds or for any other reason or elects to repay any such amount in good faith settlement of a pending or threatened avoidance claim, (i) this Agreement (including the provisions pertaining to Participations in Letters of Credit, Reimbursement Obligations and Swing Line Loans) shall continue in full force (or be reinstated, as the case may be) and the Borrower shall be liable to, and shall indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender harmless for, the amount of such payment surrendered until the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or such Lender shall have been finally paid in full, and (ii) in the event any portion of any amount so required to be surrendered by the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank or the Swing Line lender shall have been distributed to the Lenders, the Lenders shall promptly repay such amounts to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Bank or the Swing Line lender on demand therefor. The provisions of the foregoing sentence shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Lenders in reliance upon such payment, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Administrative Agent's, any Issuing Bank's or the Lenders' rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment having become final and irrevocable.
Termination
11.9 . (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person and each Lender and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding or preparation of defense in connection therewith) the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans or the Letters of Credit (all of the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"), except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity in this applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Borrower agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to it, any of its Subsidiaries, any Guarantor, or any security holders or creditors thereof arising out of, related to or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except to the extent that such liability resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent-Related Person, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

(b) The agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in this shall continue in effect notwithstanding the Facility Termination Date.
Section 11.9
11.10 . If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be determined to be illegal or invalid as to one or more of the parties hereto, then such provision shall remain in effect with respect to all parties, if any, as to whom such provision is neither illegal nor invalid, and in any event all other provisions hereof shall remain effective and binding on the parties hereto.
Severability
11.11 . This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous proposals, negotiations, representations, commitments and other communications between or among the parties, both oral and written, with respect thereto (except that those provisions (if any) which by the express terms of the commitment letter dated as of June 6, 2005, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC and accepted by the Borrower, survive the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility and Letter of Credit Facility, shall survive and continue in effect).
Entire Agreement
11.12 . In the event that any term of any of the Loan Documents other than this Agreement conflicts with any express term of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall control to the extent of such conflict.
Agreement Controls
11.13 . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged hereunder, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (as such term is defined below). If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower. As used in this paragraph, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to such Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.

America's largest automotive retailerannounced that it has closed on a new $600 million five-year unsecured credit facility with investment grade terms. The new facility replaces a $300 million, five-year credit facility that was set to expire on August 9, 2006 and a $200 million 364-day credit facility that was set to expire on August 5, 2005. The new credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 14, 2005) - AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
,
Commenting on the new credit facility, Craig Monaghan, chief financial officer, said, "The terms of the new facility demonstrate the significant progress AutoNation has made over the past five years and the confidence that our lenders have in our future business plans. We recently became the first public auto retailer to achieve investment grade status and view this new credit facility as further validation of our business model and financial discipline." Monaghan also said, "The new credit spreads are more than 100 basis points less than the credit spreads under the five-year credit facility that we are replacing. We expect to take advantage of additional opportunities to improve our credit spreads and optimize our capital structure as we move forward."
The Administrative Agent for the credit facility is JPMorgan Chase Bank, N. A. and the Syndication Agent is Bank of America, N. A. A total of 13 lenders are committed to the new credit facility.
