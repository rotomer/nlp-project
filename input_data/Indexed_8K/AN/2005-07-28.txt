America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2005 second-quarter net income from continuing operations of $106 million or $0.40 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $97 million or $0.35 per share, an increase of 14%. This increase was primarily a result of solid growth in both revenue and gross profit coupled with continued share repurchase, resolution of various tax matters and leverage of the Company's cost structure.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 28, 2005) - AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Second-quarter 2005 revenue totaled $5.0 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the year-ago period resulting from revenue growth in new vehicles of 3%, retail used vehicles of 4%, parts and service of 8% and finance and insurance of 4%. Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) in the quarter was $556 million or 70.8% of total gross profit, a 70 basis point improvement versus prior year. Operating income for the second quarter was $210 million, a second-quarter record, up 7% versus prior year.
Commenting on the quarter, Mike Jackson, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "AutoNation delivered solid results in the second quarter in every area of the business, including new and used vehicles, finance and insurance and we're especially pleased with our high-margin parts and service business. We also continued to make strides on the cost side of the equation." At the end of the second quarter 2005, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 51 days supply versus 74 days at the end of second quarter 2004, representing a decline of 27,000 units or 26%.
Discontinued operations in the second quarter included a benefit of $0.36 per share from the resolution of various tax matters under audit from prior years.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, the Company earned net income from continuing operations of $195 million or $0.72 per share. Excluding senior note repurchase cost, earnings per share from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 were $204 million or $0.76 per share, compared to $0.68 per share in the prior year, an increase of 12%. The Company's revenue for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 totaled $9.6 billion, compared to $9.4 billion in the prior year.
