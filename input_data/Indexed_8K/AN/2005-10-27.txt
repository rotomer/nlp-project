Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2005 third-quarter net income from continuing operations of $120 million or $0.45 per share, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $96 million or $0.35 per share, an increase in EPS of 29%. Excluding the $0.04 per share benefit from the resolution of certain tax matters, the Company's third-quarter EPS from continuing operations was $0.41, up 17% compared to a year ago. This increase was primarily a result of solid growth in both revenue and gross profit in every area of the business coupled with continued share repurchases and the leveraging of the Company's cost structure.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (October 27, 2005)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
Third-quarter 2005 revenue totaled $5.2 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the year-ago period, and resulted primarily from revenue growth in new vehicles of 2%, retail used vehicles of 10%, parts and service of 9%, and finance and insurance of 6%. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in the quarter were $567 million or 70.2% of total gross profit, a 90-basis point improvement versus the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter was $220 million, a third-quarter record, up 13% versus the prior year.
Commenting on the third-quarter performance, AutoNation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said, "AutoNation's team of 347 franchises and 27,000 employees can be very proud of their performance over the past quarter. Once again, our Company delivered record third-quarter earnings per share, increased revenue and increased net income  all indicators of just how strong and efficient our organization has become. In addition to operational improvements in nearly every area of the business  new and used vehicles, parts and service, finance and insurance  we benefited during this time from the employee discount programs launched by the Detroit 3. During the third-quarter 2005 our markets were not significantly affected by hurricanes as we were in the third-quarter 2004. However, in the fourth-quarter Hurricane Wilma has impacted our South Florida operations, where we have 33 dealerships representing approximately 20% of our national business. We have a short-term disruption to our South Florida business at this point and we are in the process of assessing the damage. We do not expect a long-term effect on our business."
At the end of the third-quarter 2005, AutoNation's new vehicle inventory level was 43 days supply versus 53 days at the end of the third-quarter 2004, representing a decline of 17,000 units or 22%.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $315 million or $1.17 per share. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period totaled $14.8 billion, up 3%.
