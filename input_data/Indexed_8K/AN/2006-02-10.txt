Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
In 2002, the Board of Directors of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") adopted, and the Companys stockholders approved, the AutoNation, Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), which provides for a performance-based annual bonus program for senior executive officers. A copy of the Plan was filed as Exhibit A to the Companys Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 12, 2002. The Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation Subcommittee (the "Subcommittee") of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. On February 6, 2006, the Subcommittee selected participants in the Plan for 2006, established specific annual performance goals and set target awards for participants in the Plan for 2006. The Subcommittee selected the following senior executive officers to participate in the Plan for 2006: the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; Execut ive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary. The performance goals under the Plan for 2006 that were established by the Subcommittee are based upon the achievement of specified levels of operating income per share (minus a charge for capital deployed for acquisitions or share repurchases) and operating income as a percentage of gross profit for the Company during 2006. The Subcommittee also established an objective standard for calculating the amount of the target award for each Plan participant. The performance goals established under the Plan for 2006 also constitute the performance goals that have been established for the 2006 corporate bonus plan to ensure that bonus-eligible corporate associates are fully aligned as a team to achieve improved operating performance for our existing business and to deploy capital effectively and profitably. In administering the Plan, the Subcommittees objective is to create a direct li nk between pay and performance for the Companys senior executives. The Subcommittee retains absolute "negative discretion" to eliminate or reduce the amount of any award under the Plan and to make all determinations under the Plan.
