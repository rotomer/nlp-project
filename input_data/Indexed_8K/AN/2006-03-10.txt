Exhibit 99.1
(NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, announced today that it has commenced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 9% senior notes due 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $323.5 million. In connection with the offer, holders of the notes are being solicited to provide consents to certain amendments to the indenture for the notes that would eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and events of default contained in the indenture. The Company previously announced its intention to commence the offer on March 7, 2006.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (March 10, 2006) - AutoNation, Inc.
The consent solicitation will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 24, 2006 (the "Consent Deadline"), and the offer will expire at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on April 12, 2006, in each case unless extended by the Company.
As described in more detail in the offer to purchase and consent solicitation that will be distributed to note holders promptly, the total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase by AutoNation will be calculated, in accordance with standard market practice, five business days prior to the expiration of the offer based upon a fixed spread of 50 basis points over the bid side yield on the 4.125% U.S. Treasury Note due August 15, 2008. The foregoing total consideration for the notes includes a consent payment equal to $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered. Holders must validly tender their notes on or before the Consent Deadline in order to be eligible to receive the total consideration, which includes the consent payment. Holders who validly tender their notes after the Consent Deadline and before the expiration of the offer will only be eligible to receive an amount equal to the total consideration minus the consent payment. Additionally, holders whose notes are purchased pursuant to the offer will receive any accrued but unpaid interest up to but not including the payment date for the notes.
Completion of the offer and consent solicitation is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, receipt of valid tenders and consents from at least a majority in principal amount of outstanding notes and receipt of debt financing in an amount that, with existing cash, will be sufficient to purchase the notes tendered in the offer and the shares tendered in the concurrent cash tender offer to purchase 50 million shares of the Company's common stock at a price of $23 per share. The offer and consent solicitation may be amended, extended or, under certain conditions, terminated.
The information agent for the offer and consent solicitation is Innisfree M&A Incorporated. The depositary for the offer is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The dealer managers for the offer are J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. ((212) 270-7407, call collect) and Wachovia Securities ((704) 715-8341, call collect).
The offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal and consent and related documents will be distributed to noteholders promptly. Noteholders with questions or who would like additional copies of the offer documents may call the information agent, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, toll-free at (877) 825-8631.
