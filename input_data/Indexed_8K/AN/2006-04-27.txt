          (a) The Company will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (which is not a Guarantor), directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary unless such Restricted Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for a Guarantee of the Notes on the same terms as the guarantee of such Indebtedness except that (A) such guarantee need not be secured unless required pursuant to Section 4.12 and (B) if such Indebtedness is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Notes, any such assumption, guarantee or other liability of such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of the Notes at least to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes.
          The preceding paragraph shall not be applicable to any guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary (i) permitted to be incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (4), (5) and (7) of Section 4.9 hereof; or (ii) given to a bank or trust company or any commercial banking institution that is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any branch, subsidiary or Affiliate thereof), in connection with the operation of cash management programs established for its benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary.
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Notes shall provide by its terms that it (and all Liens securing the same) shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company, of all of the Company's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary, which transaction is in compliance with the terms of this Indenture and such
 
Restricted Subsidiary is released from all guarantees, if any, by it of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (ii) the Designation of a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with this Indenture and (iii) with respect to any Guarantees created after the Issue Date, the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Company described in the preceding clause (a) above of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness), at such time as (A) no other Indebtedness of the Company has been guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary or (B) the holders of all such other Indebtedness which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness).
     Section 4.17. .
Suspension Period
          During the Suspension Period, the provisions of this Indenture under Sections 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.13, 4.15 and the requirement set forth in paragraph (3) of Section 5.1 will no longer be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
          "Suspension Period" means the period (a) beginning on the date that:
and (b) ending on the date (the "Reversion Date") that neither Moody's nor Standard & Poor's has an Investment Grade rating on the Notes. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any Reversion Date.
          On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred pursuant to clause (a) of Section 4.9 of this Indenture or one of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent any Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred pursuant to clause (a) of Section 4.9 of this Indenture or any of the clauses set forth in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as Permitted Indebtedness under clause (3) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness and permitted to be refinanced under clause (16) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness.
          For purposes of calculating the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (3) of paragraph (a) of Section 4.7, calculations under that clause will be made with reference to the Issue Date as set forth in that clause. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under such clause (3) and the events specified in subclauses (A) through (F) of such clause (3) that occur during the Suspension Period will increase the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under such clause (3).
          For purposes of Section 4.10, on the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

     Section 6.1. .
Events of Default
          The occurrence of any of the following will constitute an ":"
Event of Default
 
 
     Section 6.2. .
Acceleration
          If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clauses (8) and (9) of Section 6.1) shall occur and be continuing with respect to this Indenture as it relates to Floating Rate Notes or Fixed Rate Notes, as the case may be, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes or Fixed Rate Notes, as the case may be, then outstanding may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare all unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on all such Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders) and upon any such declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest shall become due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (8) or (9) of Section 6.1 occurs and is continuing, then all the Notes shall ipso facto become and be due and payable immediately in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date the Notes become due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. Thereupon, the Trustee may, at its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the Holders by appropriate judicial proceedings.
          After a declaration of acceleration, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding as to which a notice of acceleration has been given may, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if
 
          No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes or Fixed Rate Notes outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all outstanding Notes of the respective series waive any past default under this Indenture and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note of such series (which may only be waived with the consent of each Holder affected) or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision which under this Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder affected by such modification or amendment.
          No Holder has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to this Indenture or any remedy thereunder, unless the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of that series have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee under such Notes and this Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding within 15 days after receipt of such notice and the Trustee, within such 15-day period, has not received directions inconsistent with such written request by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes outstanding. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note.
     Section 6.3. .
Other Remedies
          If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
          The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
     Section 6.4. .
Waiver of Past Defaults
          The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes of that series, waive any past Defaults, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, or interest on any Note of that series, or in respect of a covenant or provision which under this Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Note of that series outstanding. Upon such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 6.5. .
Control by Majority
          Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of that series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. Holders may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes, however, except as provided in this Indenture. In addition, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes of that series or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
     Section 6.6. .
Limitation on Suits
          A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note.
     Section 6.7. .
Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
     Section 6.8. .
Collection Suit by Trustee
          If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount of principal of, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
     Section 6.9. .
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim
          The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any
 
custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7 out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
     Section 6.10. .
Priorities
          If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
          First: to the Trustee, its agents and counsel for amounts due under Section 7.7, including payment of all compensation, expense and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
          Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium and Additional Interest, if any, and interest, respectively; and
          Third: to the Company or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.
          The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.
     Section 6.11. .
Undertaking for Costs
          In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.7, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

          (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

          A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture.

The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, that all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.7.

consent is not made on any Note.

Guarantee
          Subject to this Article X, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, Additional Interest, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid by the Company in full or performed by the Company, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due or performed by the Company in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due by the Company of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed which failure continues for ten days after demand therefor is made to the Company for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
          The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any
 
action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph), filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph) whatsoever and covenant that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture. Each Guarantor also expressly waives, without any requirement of any notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of all principles or provisions of applicable law which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, Section 10-7-23 and Section 10-7-24 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
          If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
          Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VI hereof for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VI hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee, failing payment when due by the Company which failure continues for ten days after demand therefor is made to the Company. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
     Section 10.2. .
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
          Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee and this Article X shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article X, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

Interest
Calculation Agent
Interest Payment Date
provided
          Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. The amount of interest for each day that the Floating Rate Notes are outstanding (the "") shall be calculated by dividing the interest rate in effect for such day by 360 and multiplying the result by the principal outstanding amount of the Floating Rate Notes. The amount of interest to be paid on the Floating Rate Notes for each Interest Period shall be calculated by adding the Daily Interest Amounts for each day in the Interest Period.
Daily Interest Amount
          "," with respect to an Interest Period, will be the second London Banking Day preceding the first day of the Interest Period.
Determination Date
          "" means the period commencing on and including an Interest Payment Date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding Interest Payment Date; that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include April 12, 2006, and end on and include July 14, 2006.
Interest Period
provided
 
          "" with respect to an Interest Period will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in United States dollars for three-month periods beginning on the first day of such Interest Period that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the Determination Date.

If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, LIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in United States dollars to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the first day of such Interest Period. If at least two such rates are so provided, LIBOR for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then LIBOR for the Interest Period will be LIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.
LIBOR
          "" is any day in which dealings in United States dollars are transacted or, with respect to any future date, are expected to be transacted in the London interbank market.
London Banking Day

Treasury Yield
provided
          All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)) and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards).

          The Calculation Agent will, upon the request of the holder of any Floating Rate Note, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof. Such payment shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote Request for Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate or (B) the Quotation Date, in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote Request for Competitive Bid Loans at the Absolute Rate (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) that if JPMorgan Chase Bank is receiving quotes as provided in , any Competitive Bid Quote may be submitted by JPMorgan Chase Bank (or its applicable Lending Office) only if JPMorgan Chase Bank (or such applicable Lending Office) notifies the Borrower of the terms of the offer contained therein not later than 9:15 A.M. on the Quotation Date. Any Competitive Bid Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the consent of the Administrative Agent given on the instructions of the Borrower.

Section 2.5(g)
     (ii) Each Competitive Bid Quote shall be substantially in the form of attached hereto and shall specify:
Exhibit H
     (A) the proposed date of borrowing and the Interest Period therefor;
     (B) the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount shall be at least $5,000,000 (or in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); that the aggregate principal amount of all Competitive Bid Loans for which a Lender submits Competitive Bid Quotes may not exceed the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for a particular Interest Period for which offers were requested;
provided
     (C) in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote for Competitive Bid Loans at an Absolute Rate, the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/10,000th of 1%) offered for each such Competitive Bid Loan (the "Absolute Rate");
     (D) in the case of a Competitive Bid Quote for Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate, the positive or negative margin to be added to or deducted from the Interbank Offered Rate; and
     (E) the identity of the quoting Lender.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, no Competitive Bid Quote shall contain qualifying, conditional or similar language or propose terms other than or in addition to those set forth in the applicable Competitive Bid Quote Request and, in particular, no Competitive Bid Quote may be conditioned upon acceptance by the Borrower of all (or some specified minimum) of the principal amount of the Competitive Bid Loan for which such Competitive Bid Quote is being made. Any subsequent Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Revolving Credit Lender that amends, modifies or is otherwise inconsistent with a previous Competitive Bid Quote submitted by such Lender with respect to the same Competitive Bid Quote Request shall be disregarded by the Borrower unless such subsequent Competitive Bid Quote is submitted solely to correct a manifest error in such former Competitive Bid Quote.
     (d) The Borrower shall as promptly as practicable after the Competitive Bid Quote is submitted (but in any event not later than 12:00 Noon on (A) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at an Absolute Rate, the Quotation Date (or such other time and date as
 
33
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree) or (B) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at a Eurodollar Competitive Rate, the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing) notify the Administrative Agent and Revolving Credit Lenders of (x) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for which Competitive Bid Quotes have been received as well as the ranges of bids submitted for each Interest Period requested, (y) the respective principal amounts and Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, so offered by each Revolving Credit Lender (identifying the Lender that made each Competitive Bid Quote), and (z) its acceptance or nonacceptance of the Competitive Bid Quotes. In the case of acceptance, such notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for each Interest Period that are accepted. The Borrower may accept any Competitive Bid Quote in whole or in part ( that any Competitive Bid Quote accepted in part shall be at least $5,000,000 or in increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); that:
provided
provided
     (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Borrowing may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Competitive Bid Quote Request;
     (ii) the aggregate principal amount of each Competitive Bid Borrowing shall be at least $5,000,000 (or an increment of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) but shall not cause the limits specified in hereof to be violated;
Section 2.5(a)
     (iii) except as provided below, acceptance of Competitive Bid Quotes for any Interest Period may be made only in ascending order of Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, beginning with the lowest rate so offered; and
     (iv) the Borrower may not accept any Competitive Bid Quote where such Competitive Bid Quote fails to comply with hereof or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of this Agreement (including, without limitation, hereof).
Section 2.5(c)(ii)
Section 2.5(a)
Any of the conditions above notwithstanding, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, accept a Competitive Bid Quote that does not contain the lowest Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, where acceptance of the Competitive Bid Quote containing the lowest Absolute Rate or Eurodollar Competitive Rate, as the case may be, would be less favorable to the Borrower or would cause the principal amount of Outstanding Revolving Credit Obligations to exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment.
     If Competitive Bid Quotes are made by two or more Revolving Credit Lenders with the same Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the amount in respect of which Competitive Bid Quotes are accepted for the related Interest Period after the acceptance of all Competitive Bid Quotes, if any, of all lower Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rates, as the case may be, offered by any Revolving Credit Lender for such related Interest Period, the principal amount of Competitive Bid Loans in respect of which such Competitive Bid Quotes are accepted shall be allocated by the Borrower among such Lenders as nearly as possible (in amounts of at least $1,000,000 or in increments of $100,000 in excess thereof) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Bid Quotes. Determinations by the Borrower of the
 
34
amounts of Competitive Bid Loans and the lowest bid after adjustment as provided in shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Section 2.5(d)(iii)
     (e) Any Revolving Credit Lender whose offer to make any Competitive Bid Loan has been accepted shall, not later than 1:00 P.M. on the date specified for the making of such Loan, make the amount of such Loan available to the Borrower as shall be directed by the Authorized Representative in Dollars and in immediately available funds.
     (f) From time to time, the Borrower shall furnish such information to the Administrative Agent as the Administrative Agent may request relating to the making of Competitive Bid Loans, including the amounts, interest rates, dates of borrowings and maturities thereof.
     (g) The Borrower may request the Administrative Agent to receive the Competitive Bid Quotes, in which event the Administrative Agent shall (A) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at the Absolute Rate, as promptly as practicable after the Competitive Bid Quote is submitted (but in no event later than 10:00 A.M. on the Quotation Date) or (B) in the case of a Competitive Bid Loan at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate, by 10:00 A.M. on the date a Competitive Quote is submitted, notify the Borrower of the terms of any Competitive Bid Quote submitted by a Revolving Credit Lender that is in accordance with hereof. The Administrative Agent's notice to the Borrower shall specify (A) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Bid Borrowing for which Competitive Bid Quotes have been received and (B) the respective principal amounts and Absolute Rates or Eurodollar Competitive Rate, as the case may be, offered by each Revolving Credit Lender (identifying the Lender that made each Competitive Bid Quote). Not later than 12:00 Noon on (A) the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of borrowing, in the case of Competitive Bid Loans at the Eurodollar Competitive Rate or (B) the Quotation Date (or, in any such case, such other time and date as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may agree), the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of their acceptance or nonacceptance of the Competitive Bid Quotes so notified to it (and the failure of the Borrower to give such notice by such time shall constitute nonacceptance) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender. Together with each notice of a request for Competitive Bid Quotes which the Borrower requires the Administrative Agent to issue pursuant to this paragraph (g), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Administrative Agent a bid administration fee of $1,500.00.

The Borrower agrees that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to it, any of its Subsidiaries, any Guarantor, or any security holders or creditors thereof arising out of, related to or in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, except to the extent that such liability resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Borrower agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent-Related Person, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the First Amendment or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

Severability
     11.11 . This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous proposals, negotiations, representations, commitments and other communications between or among the parties, both oral and written, with respect thereto (except that those provisions (if any) which by the express terms of (i) the commitment letter dated as of June 6, 2005, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC and accepted by the Borrower or (ii) the commitment letter, dated as of March 6, 2006, executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P.

Agreement Controls
     11.13 . Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the aggregate interest rate charged hereunder, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate (as such term is defined below). If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate (as defined below), the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful
Usury Savings Clause
 
89
Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect. In addition, if when the Loans made hereunder are repaid in full the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender's option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be refunded to the Borrower. As used in this paragraph, the term "Highest Lawful Rate" means the maximum lawful interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, charged, or received under the laws applicable to such Lender which are presently in effect or, to the extent allowed by law, under such applicable laws which may hereafter be in effect and which allow a higher maximum nonusurious interest rate than applicable laws now allow.
