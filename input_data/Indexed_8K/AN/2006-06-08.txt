Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
As previously disclosed in AutoNation, Inc.s (the "Company") Current Report on Form 8-K and Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, each filed on April 28, 2006, Mr. J.P. Bryan informed the Company on April 25, 2006 that he would retire from the Companys Board of Directors effective with the expiration of his annual term on June 1, 2006. Mr. Bryan also served on our audit committee and, accordingly, Mr. Bryans retirement caused our audit committee to have only two members. As a result, we are currently noncompliant with Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which requires listed companies to have at least three (3) audit committee members. The Company gave notice to the NYSE of this non-compliance on June 8, 2006. The Board expects to appoint a new independent director to become a member of the audit committee by June 30, 2006 at which time the Company expects to be in full compliance with Section 303A.07(a).
