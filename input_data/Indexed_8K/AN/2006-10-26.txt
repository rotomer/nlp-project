Exhibit 99.1
     America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2006 third-quarter net income from continuing operations of $85 million or $0.40 per share on revenue of $5.0 billion, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $121 million or $0.45 per share on revenue of $5.1 billion. Adjusting the prior-year earnings for certain items as disclosed in the attached tables, the Company's third-quarter EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 versus $0.41 in the prior year, a decline of 2%.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (October 26, 2006) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     In the third quarter, industry new vehicle retail unit sales declined 11% in the U.S. and were down 16% in California according to CNW. AutoNation new vehicle retail unit sales were down 8% in total and 12% in California, which represents approximately 20% of the Company's new vehicle business. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson commented, "The third quarter was a challenging economic environment for new vehicle sales. California's economic situation has been declining during 2006 due to the rise in interest rates and a soft housing market." Mr. Jackson also noted, "The employee discount programs offered by domestic manufacturers last year make year-over-year comparisons difficult."
     In addition to the decline in new vehicle sales, results for the third quarter were impacted by increased floor plan interest expense due to higher interest rates and higher inventories, and higher other interest expense due to increased debt levels related to the Company's recapitalization earlier in 2006. The effect on EPS of higher other interest expense was more than offset by the 19% reduction in shares outstanding due to the 50 million share buyback in the second quarter.
     For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $257 million or $1.09 per share compared to $1.18 per share in the prior year. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached tables, EPS from continuing operations for the nine-month period on a comparable basis increased 5% to $1.18 from $1.12 in the prior year. The Company's revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 totaled $14.6 billion, up 1% compared to $14.4 billion in the prior year.
     Separately, the Company today announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Harloff BMW in northern San Diego County, California. The acquisition, which is subject to certain conditions and approvals, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the quarter, AutoNation acquired Land Rover Fort Lauderdale and Fairbanks Dodge in the South Florida market and Fremont Jeep in Fremont, California.
 
AutoNation estimates that the annual revenue from these acquisitions will be approximately $200 million.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
