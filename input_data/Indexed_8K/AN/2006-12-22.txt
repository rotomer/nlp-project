The Company is conducting a national search for a new Chief Financial Officer, and expects to appoint a new Chief Financial Officer in the first quarter of 2007. As previously reported on a current report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2006, Mr. McAllister, who was serving as the Companys Vice President and Corporate Controller at the time, was appointed to serve as Interim Chief Financial Officer from September 1, 2006 until December 31, 2006 (in addition to continuing to serve as Vice President  Corporate C ontroller). Mr. McAllister also had previously announced his decision to retire from the Company on December 31, 2006. During Mr. McAllisters tenure as the Companys Interim CFO, Mr. McAllisters base salary is $260,000 and he is eligible to receive a bonus payout under the Companys annual bonus program for 2006 with a target pay-out of 40% of his base salary. The actual bonus pay-out will be based on the financial performance of the Company against corporate metrics designed to incentivize management to improve the Companys operating performance and to use capital to generate high returns. In addition, on December 18, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved a retention bonus in the amount of $100,000 payable to Mr. McAllister on March 31, 2007, provided that Mr. McAllister serves as Interim Chief Financial Officer and Vice President  Corporate Controller until March 31, 2007 (or on an earlier date if both a new Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Controller are appointed). Mr. McAllister will not be eligible to participate in the Companys annual bonus program in 2007.
