Exhibit 99.1
     America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2006 fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations of $74 million or $0.35 per share on revenue of $4.5 billion, compared to year-ago net income from continuing operations of $82 million or $0.31 per share on revenue of $4.4 billion. Fourth-quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 13%.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla (February 7, 2007) AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
     Fourth quarter 2006 results were positively impacted by a 2% increase in total revenue driven by increases of 2% in new vehicle, 5% in parts and service and 8% in finance and insurance. This was offset by lower used vehicle gross profit, higher floor plan and other interest expense and $.01 per share in stock option expense. Additionally, the fourth quarter EPS was positively impacted by continued share repurchases. Fourth quarter 2005 earnings were negatively affected by Hurricane Wilma in Florida.
     For full-year 2006, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $331 million or $1.45 per share, compared to $397 million or $1.48 per share in 2005. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's full-year EPS from continuing operations for 2006 increased 8% to $1.54 from $1.43 in 2005. The Company's revenue for the full year totaled $19.0 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year.
     Full year 2006 results were positively impacted by increased gross profits in parts and service and finance and insurance, offset by lower used vehicle gross profit, higher floor plan and other interest expense and $.04 per share stock option expense impact. The effect on EPS of higher other interest expense was more than offset by the 19% reduction in shares outstanding due to the 50 million share buyback in the second quarter.
     Commenting on the fourth-quarter and year ahead, Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer said, "The retail environment was challenging during the fourth-quarter and we expect this to continue in 2007. We believe that in 2007, U.S. new vehicle sales will decline to the low 16 million unit level."

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The attached financial tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, such as net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2005, and the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, adjusted in each case to exclude certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables.
