Exhibit 99.1
America's largest automotive retailer, today reported 2007 fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $50 million or $0.27 per share on revenue of $4.2 billion, compared to year-ago fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of $74 million or $0.35 per share on revenue of $4.4 billion. Results for the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected a decline in vehicle sales especially in California and Florida, partially offset by continued share repurchases. Together, California and Florida represent approximately 50% of the Company's new vehicle business, in contrast to 20% of industry retail new vehicles sold in the U.S.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., (February 7, 2008)  AutoNation, Inc. (NYSE: AN),
For full year 2007, the Company reported net income from continuing operations of $288 million or $1.44 per share, compared to $331 million or $1.44 per share in 2006. After adjusting for certain items as disclosed in the attached financial tables, the Company's full-year EPS from continuing operations for 2007 was $1.38 compared to $1.53 in 2006. The Company's revenue for 2007 totaled $17.7 billion, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year.
Commenting on the year ahead, Mike Jackson, chairman and chief executive officer said, "We expect to continue to see a challenging new vehicle retail market, especially in California and Florida. AutoNation continues to have confidence in California and Florida and views them as healthy markets over the long term." Jackson also added, "We believe that in 2008, U.S. new vehicle industry sales will decline to the mid-15 million unit level from 16.1 million units in 2007. However, the recent action by the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates could improve the automotive retail outlook in the second half of 2008."

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The attached financial tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, such as net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, adjusted in each case to exclude certain items disclosed in the attached financial tables. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which are set forth in the attachments to this release.
