On August 23, 2010, Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a written trading plan (the "10b5-1 Plan"), in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the Company's insider trading policy, to exercise options (the "Options") to acquire 321,000 shares of the Company's common stock and to sell the shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the Options. The Options were granted in 2003 and are set to expire in 2013. Under the 10b5-1 Plan, the Options will be exercised and the underlying shares will be sold, in one or more transactions, if the market price of the Company's common stock reaches or exceeds a minimum price threshold specified in the plan. The 10b5-1 Plan is scheduled to terminate on August 31, 2011 (or sooner under certain circumstances including a sale of all 321,000 shares under the 10b5-1 Plan). The transactions executed in accordance with the 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
