On December 7, 2010, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company" or "AutoNation") received a notice from the Plan Administrator of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") notifying the Company of a blackout period under the Plan, pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The blackout period is required due to a change in the recordkeepers for the Plan. During the blackout period, participants in the Plan will be temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, request withdrawals or distributions, request new loans, change investment selections or otherwise perform account transactions under the Plan. The blackout period is expected to begin on December 28, 2010 and end on January 22, 2011.
On December 7, 2010, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them of the blackout period and the related AutoNation common stock trading restrictions (including with respect to derivatives) that apply to them during the blackout period, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
A copy of the notice to the Company's directors and executive officers is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. Stockholders or other interested parties may obtain, without charge, information regarding the blackout period by contacting AutoNation Corporate Human Resources Compensation Department at (954) 769-7315 or YourTotalRewards@AutoNation.com.
 
 
99.1    Notice to Directors and Executive Officers dated December 7, 2010.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Federal securities laws require us to send you a notice whenever restrictions are imposed on your trading in common stock (including derivatives) of AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") due to a blackout of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") that lasts for a period of more than three consecutive business days. The Plan will be changing recordkeepers from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, and as a result, there will be a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") during which participants in the Plan will be temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, request withdrawals or distributions, request new loans, change investment selections or otherwise perform account transactions under the Plan. The Blackout Period is expected to begin December 28, 2010 and end on January 22, 2011.
. As a director or executive officer of AutoNation, these prohibitions apply to you and to members of your immediate family who share your household, as well as to trusts, corporations and other entities whose stock ownership may be attributed to you. The trading prohibition does not apply, however, to certain transactions, such as qualified Rule 10b5-1 trading plan transactions, bona fide gifts or transactions involving equity securities that were not acquired in connection with your services as a director or executive officer.
Under Section 306(a)(1) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 101 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the Blackout Period,
all directors and executive officers of AutoNation are prohibited, with limited exceptions, from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any AutoNation common stock (including exercising stock options) or any derivatives of AutoNation common stock, regardless of whether the director or officer participates in the Plan
Any profit realized by a director or executive officer from any non-exempt transaction involving AutoNation common stock during the Blackout Period is recoverable by AutoNation. You should seek securities law advice if you plan to engage in any potential stock transactions during the Blackout Period.
If you have questions regarding the Blackout Period, including when it has started or ended, you may contact the AutoNation Corporate Human Resources Compensation Department at 200 SW 1st Ave, Ste 1400, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301, telephone: (954) 769-7315, email: YourTotalRewards@AutoNation.com.
