On December 7, 2010, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") received a notice from the Plan Administrator of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") notifying the Company of a blackout period under the Plan, pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. On December 7, 2010, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR, the Company sent a notice (the "Prior Notice") of the blackout period to its directors and executive officers, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 7, 2010. The Prior Notice indicated that the blackout period was required due to a change in recordkeepers for the Plan and was expected to begin on December 28, 2010 and end on January 22, 2011 (the "Blackout Period").
On January 7, 2011, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR, the Company sent an updated notice (the "Updated Notice") to its directors and executive officers informing them that because the change in recordkeepers and the related data transfers are expected to be completed earlier than anticipated, the blackout period is now expected to end on January 10, 2011. A copy of the Updated Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
This is an update to the notice we sent you on December 7, 2010. As you may recall, we sent that notice because federal securities laws require us to send you a notice whenever restrictions are imposed on your trading in common stock (including derivatives) of AutoNation, Inc. ("AutoNation") due to a blackout of the AutoNation 401(k) Plan (the "Plan") that lasts for a period of more than three consecutive business days. The Plan is changing recordkeepers from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, and as a result, there has been a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") during which participants in the Plan have been temporarily unable to change their contribution rates, request withdrawals or distributions, request new loans, change investment selections or otherwise perform account transactions under the Plan.
The Blackout Period was expected to end on January 22, 2011.
Because the change in recordkeepers and the related data transfers are expected to be completed earlier than anticipated, the Blackout Period is now expected to end on January 10, 2011.
