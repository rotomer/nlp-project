On September 16, 2011, Michael J. Short, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into a written trading plan ("Mr. Short's 10b5-1 Plan"), in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the Company's insider trading policy, to exercise options to acquire 165,494 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and to sell the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of such options. Under Mr. Short's 10b5-1 Plan, the options will be exercised and shares will be sold, in one or more transactions, if the market price of the Common Stock reaches or exceeds certain minimum price thresholds specified in the plan. Mr. Short's 10b5-1 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 16, 2012 (or sooner under certain circumstances including a sale of all 165,494 shares under the plan).
