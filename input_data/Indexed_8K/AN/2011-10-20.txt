per share, compared to net income from continuing operations of
$59 million
, or
$0.39
per share, for the same period in the prior year, a
23%
improvement on a per-share basis.
2011
third
quarter revenue totaled
$3.5 billion
, compared to
$3.3 billion
in the year-ago period, an increase of
7%
, driven primarily by higher new and used vehicle average selling prices. AutoNations new vehicle unit sales decreased
2%
on a same store basis and were flat overall, as the Japanese earthquake affected availability of vehicles produced by Japanese manufacturers. Based on CNW Research data, in the
third
quarter, total U.S. industry new retail vehicle unit sales increased 1%.
AutoNations 2011
third
quarter retail used vehicle revenue increased
7%
. Parts and service revenue increased
2%
, and finance and insurance revenue increased
9%
compared to the 2010
third
quarter.
2011
third
quarter gross profit totaled
$575 million
, compared to
$545 million
in the year-ago period, an increase of
5%
, primarily due to an increase in retail new vehicle gross profit, as well as an increase in finance and insurance gross profit. On a per-vehicle basis, gross profit per new vehicle retailed increased
$460
or
23%
, while finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed increased
$83
or
7%
, as compared to the year-ago period.
Mike Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, We continued to deliver solid double-digit growth in operating income in the third quarter, which was driven by strong gross margins in new vehicles and finance and insurance. Mr. Jackson added, While shipments from the Japanese manufacturers improved in the third quarter, inventory levels of these vehicles remained constrained. We would expect that the improving supply environment will result in lower margins on these vehicles in the fourth quarter.
Mr. Jackson concluded, We believe that the new vehicle sales environment will continue to improve in the fourth quarter, and we remain optimistic about the long-term recovery of the U.S. auto market.
