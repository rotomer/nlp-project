On February 1, 2012, AutoNation, Inc. (the "Company") closed its sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Notes"), pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") entered into on January 27, 2012, among the Company, the Company's subsidiary guarantors (the "Guarantors") and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes sold pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement were registered under the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-157354) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Notes were issued under a senior indenture, dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by a supplemental indenture entered into on February 1, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture") among the Company, the Trustee and the Guarantors.
The Notes will mature on February 1, 2020 and bear interest at a rate equal to 5.500% per year, payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2012. The Notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's subsidiaries. The Indenture contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.
The Underwriting Agreement is being filed as Exhibit 1.1, the Base Indenture is being filed as Exhibit 4.1 and the Supplemental Indenture (which includes the Form of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2020) is being filed as Exhibit 4.2, and each is incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture are summary in nature and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of the definitive agreements.
 
On January 27, 2012, the Company announced the pricing of the Notes. A copy of the press release announcing the pricing of the Notes is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
 
        Certain of the agreements listed as exhibits to this Form 8-K (including the schedules and exhibits to such agreements), which are being filed to provide investors with information regarding their terms, contains various representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and the other parties thereto. They are not intended to provide any factual information about any of the parties thereto or any subsidiaries of the parties thereto. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of each of the agreements, solely for the benefit of the parties thereto. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what a security holder might view as material, or may have been made for purposes of allocating contractual risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Investors should not view the representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements (or any description thereof) as disclosures with respect to the actual state of facts concerning the business, operations or condition of any of the parties to the agreements (or their subsidiaries) and should not rely on them as such. In addition, information in any such representations, warranties or covenants may change after the dates covered by such provisions, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the public disclosures of the parties. In any event, investors should read the agreements together with the other information concerning the Company contained in reports and statements that it files with the SEC.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Contribution
(a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any legal or other fees or disbursements reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in . For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee, affiliates and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or a Guarantor, each officer of the Company or a Guarantor who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors.

to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.

Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. and the other underwriters party thereto (collectively, the "Underwriters"), hereby certifies that, as of the date hereof:
1. The undersigned has reviewed the Company's preliminary prospectus supplement, dated January 27, 2012, as supplemented by the pricing term sheet dated January 27, 2012, including each of the documents incorporated by reference therein (collectively, the "Offering Materials"), each relating to the offering of the Notes.
2. The undersigned is knowledgeable with respect to the accounting records and internal accounting practices, policies, procedures and controls of the Company and, together with the Company's chief executive officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company.

Without Consent of Holders of Notes
(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the Indenture or the Notes;
(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
(3) to provide for the assumption of the Company's obligations to Holders of Notes in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;

(5) to secure the Notes or to add additional Guarantors;
(6) to comply with the requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act;
 
(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any provision of the "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement to the extent that such provision in the "Description of the Notes" in the Prospectus Supplement was intended to be a verbatim recitation of the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes;
(8) to remove a Guarantor which, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, ceases to be liable in respect of its Subsidiary Guarantee;

SECTION 8.02 .
With Consent of Holders of Notes
Except as provided below in this Section 8.02, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes and/or any Subsidiary Guarantees may be amended or supplemented (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes affected by such modifications or amendments; and, subject to Section 7.06 of the Base Indenture, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).
Upon the written request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of any document requested by it pursuant to Section 11.02(e) of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Section 7.06, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company and/or the Guarantors with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section 8.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described in Section 4.01 of this Supplemental Indenture);
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of and interest on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of or interest on the Notes;
(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described in Section 4.01 of this Supplemental Indenture);
(8) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions;
(9) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee; or
(10) release any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from its Subsidiary Guarantee, except as provided in the Indenture.
SECTION 8.03 . Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
Revocation and Effect of Consents
SECTION 8.04 . The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any affected Note thereafter
Notation on or Exchange of Notes
 
authenticated. The Company in exchange for all affected Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an authentication order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
SECTION 8.05 The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article VIII if the amendment or supplement does not in the judgment of the Trustee adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until its Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee shall receive and (subject to Section 11.01 of the Base Indenture) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
SECTION 9.01 .
Guarantee
Subject to this Article IX, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of the Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due, whether at Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid by the Company in full or performed by the Company, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid by the Company in full when due or performed by the Company in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due by the Company of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed which failure continues for ten (10) days after demand therefor is made to the Company for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a Guarantee of payment and not a Guarantee of collection.
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph), filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands (except as specifically provided in the preceding paragraph) whatsoever and covenant that this Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture. Each Guarantor also expressly waives,
 
without any requirement of any notice to or further assent by such Guarantor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the benefit of all principles or provisions of applicable law which are or might be in conflict with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, Section 10-7-23 and Section 10-7-24 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated.
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article VII of the Base Indenture and Article VI of this Supplemental Indenture for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article VII of the Base Indenture and Article VI of this Supplemental Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee, failing payment when due by the Company which failure continues for ten (10) days after demand therefor is made to the Company. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantee.
SECTION 9.02 . Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Article IX shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article IX, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
SECTION 9.03 .
Execution and Delivery of Guarantee
To evidence the Subsidiary Guarantees set forth in Section 9.01 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company hereby agrees to cause a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form of hereto to be endorsed by manual or facsimile signature by an officer of each Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee. The Company shall cause all future Guarantors to execute a supplemental indenture substantially in the form of hereto.
Exhibit B
Exhibit C
Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 9.01 of this Supplemental Indenture and in any subsequent supplemental indentures shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
 
If an officer whose signature is on any supplemental indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be valid and obligatory nevertheless.
The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Domestic Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, if required by Section 5.03 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Company shall cause such Domestic Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to the Indenture and Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with Section 5.03 of this Supplemental Indenture and this Article IX, to the extent applicable.
SECTION 9.04 . The Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:
Release of Guarantor
(a) upon any sale, exchange or transfer, to any Person not an Affiliate of the Company, of all of the Company's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Domestic Subsidiary, which transaction is in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and such Domestic Subsidiary is released from all guarantees, if any, by it of other Indebtedness of the Company or any Domestic Subsidiary;
(b) either Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance occurs with respect to such Notes in compliance with Article VII of this Supplemental Indenture; or
(c) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantees created after the Issue Date, the release by the holders of the Indebtedness of the Company described in Section 5.03(a) of this Supplemental Indenture of their Guarantee by such Domestic Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness), at such time as (A) no other Indebtedness of the Company has been guaranteed by such Domestic Subsidiary or (B) the holders of all such other Indebtedness which is guaranteed by such Domestic Subsidiary also release their Guarantee by such Domestic Subsidiary (including any deemed release upon payment in full of all obligations under such Indebtedness).
The Trustee, at the expense and written direction of the Company, will execute proper instruments acknowledging the termination of such Subsidiary Guarantee as reasonably required by the representative of such Guarantor.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal and premium, if any, of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in this Article IX.
SECTION 9.05 . It is hereby acknowledged that the enforcement of certain rights with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantees is subject to the terms and conditions of the Manufacturers' Letter Agreements.
Acknowledgement of Manufacturers' Letter Agreements
 
SECTION 9.06 . As used in this Section 9.06, any reference to "the principal" includes the Company, and any reference to "the creditor" includes the Holders. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code:
Certain California Law Waivers
(a) each Guarantor agrees (i) to waive any and all rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the Company or against any collateral or security granted by the Company for any of the Guarantor's obligations and (ii) to withhold the exercise of any and all rights of contribution against any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations and against any collateral or security granted by any such other guarantor for any of the Guarantor's obligations until the Guarantor's obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full;
(b) each Guarantor waives any and all other rights and defenses available to the Guarantor by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code, including any and all rights or defenses Guarantor may have by reason of protection afforded to the principal with respect to any of the Guarantor's obligations, or to any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations with respect to any of such guarantor's obligations under its guaranty, in either case pursuant to the antideficiency or other laws of the State of California limiting or discharging the principal's indebtedness or such guarantor's obligations, including Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure; and
(c) each Guarantor waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the creditor, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for any Subsidiary Guarantee obligation, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; and even though that election of remedies by the creditor, such as nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for an obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guarantor's obligations, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of contribution against such other guarantor.
No other provision of this Article IX shall be construed as limiting the generality of any of the covenants and waivers set forth in this Section 9.06. In accordance with Section 10.06 of this Supplemental Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees shall be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York.

The Company issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of April 14, 2010 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by that Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 1, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), each among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S.C.   77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture (the "Trust Indenture Act"). Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act for a statement of those terms.
The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 2.03(e) of the Supplemental Indenture, to create and issue further securities having the same ranking and terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects, except for the issue date, the public offering price and, in some cases, the first Interest Payment Date. The Notes initially issued on the Issue Date and any additional Notes shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture.
 
Except as described below, the Notes will not be redeemable by the Company prior to Maturity.
At any time prior to February 1, 2015, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings of its common stock at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 105.5%, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date; : (1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued on the Issue Date remains Outstanding after each such redemption; and (2) notice of any such redemption is mailed within 60 days of each such Public Equity Offering (with a copy to the Trustee).
provided that
"Public Equity Offering" means an underwritten public offering of common stock (other than redeemable Capital Stock) of the Company with gross cash proceeds to the Company of at least $50.0 million pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act (other than a registration statement on Form S-4 (or any successor form covering substantially the same transactions), Form S-8 (or any successor form covering substantially the same transactions) or otherwise relating to equity securities issuable under any employee benefit plan).
In addition, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of: (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption, discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield, plus fifty (50) basis points, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
 
The Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. Notice of redemption (with a copy to the Trustee) shall be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder to be redeemed at his or her registered address.
 
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, the Company shall be required to make an offer to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or a portion of such Holder's Notes (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date fixed for redemption). Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurred, the Company must send (with a copy to the Trustee), by first class mail, a notice to each Holder, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer and shall be in compliance with the Indenture. Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice.
 
The Notes are in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 principal and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register, transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or exchange any Notes selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of the Note not to be redeemed) or any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.
 
The registered Holder of this Note may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, the Company at any time shall be entitled to terminate some or all of its and the Guarantors' obligations under the Notes and the Indenture if the Company deposits with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be.
 
The Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be amended or supplemented as provided in the Indenture.
 
If any Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable by notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee (if declared by the Holders) specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a "notice of acceleration," and the same shall
 
become immediately due and payable. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then Outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.
 
The full and punctual payment by the Company of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by each of the Guarantors. Reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and obligations thereunder of the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders.
 
Subject to certain limitations imposed by the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Company or its Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Company or its Affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.
 
Any past, present, or future director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, as such, of the Company, any Guarantors or the Trustee shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Note, each Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Notes.
 
This Note shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) signs the certificate of authentication on the other side of this Note.
 
Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as TEN COM (=tenants in common), TEN ENT (=tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (=joint tenants with rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (=custodian), and U/G/M/A (=Uniform Gift to Minors Act).
 
Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.
 
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS NOTE.
