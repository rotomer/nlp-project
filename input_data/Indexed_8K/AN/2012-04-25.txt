2012

2012
first
quarter gross profit totaled
$603 million
, compared to
$566 million
in the year-ago period, an increase of

In the first quarter of 2011, gross profit was favorably impacted by $4.6 million, or $82 on a per new vehicle retailed basis, related to additional incentives on premium luxury vehicles previously sold.

first
quarter of
