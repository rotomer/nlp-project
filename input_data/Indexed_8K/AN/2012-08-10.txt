On August 9, 2012, Jonathan P. Ferrando, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of AutoNation, Inc. (the Company), entered into a stock trading plan (the Plan), in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and the Company's insider trading policy. The Plan provides for (1) the sale of up to 92,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Common Stock), to be acquired through the exercise of employee stock options and (2) the acquisition of 8,000 shares of Common Stock through the exercise of employee stock options (which shares will be held by Mr. Ferrando), in each case if the market price of the Common Stock reaches or exceeds certain minimum price thresholds specified in the Plan. As of August 9, 2012, Mr. Ferrando has exceeded the level of Common Stock ownership required under the Company's executive stock ownership guidelines, and the full execution of the Plan would increase the number of shares of Common Stock held by Mr. Ferrando. The Plan is scheduled to terminate on February 8, 2013 (or sooner under certain circumstances including the sale of all 92,000 shares and acquisition of all 8,000 shares under the Plan). Any transactions executed in accordance with the Plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
