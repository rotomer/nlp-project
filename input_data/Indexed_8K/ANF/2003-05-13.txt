ABERCROMBIE & FITCH REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EPS GROWTH OF 13% NEW ALBANY, Ohio / May 13, 2003 - Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) today reported that earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter ended May 3, 2003 rose 13% to $.26 versus $.23 for the comparable period last year. Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended May 3, 2003 increased 11% to $346.7 million from $312.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended May 4, 2002. Comparable store sales decreased 6% in the quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 10% to $25.6 million compared to net income of $23.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Mike Jeffries, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am pleased with our ability to achieve earnings growth in what continues to be a challenging retail environment. However, the state of the economy and the retail environment remain very uncertain and it is very difficult to predict the level of business for the balance of the second quarter. At this point we are comfortable that we can earn between $.30 and $.34 per diluted share in the second quarter." Abercrombie & Fitch operated a total of 602 stores at the end of the first quarter, including 165 abercrombie stores and 95 Hollister Co. stores. The Company also operates an e-commerce website at www.abercrombie.com, a kids' e-commerce website at www.abercrombiekids.com and publishes the A&F Quarterly.
