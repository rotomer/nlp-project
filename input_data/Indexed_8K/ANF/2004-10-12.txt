Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations - ------------------------------------------------ Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. ------------------------------------------------------ On October 10, 2004, Seth R. Johnson executed the letter agreement (the "Amendment") which had been executed by Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the "Registrant"), under date of October 6, 2004, providing for the amendment of the Retirement Agreement, executed on May 20, 2004 (the "Retirement Agreement"), between the Registrant and Mr. Johnson. A copy of the Retirement Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.9 to the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 1, 2004 and a copy of the Amendment is being filed as Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Mr. Johnson had served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Registrant until his retirement from those positions effective June 18, 2004 and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Registrant until his resignation effective July 26, 2004. Pursuant to the Amendment, the Registrant and Mr. Johnson agreed to modify specific provisions of the Retirement Agreement effective November 1, 2004. The total amount of severance benefits paid to Mr. Johnson under the Retirement Agreement will be reduced by the sum of $800,000, such that the Registrant will have paid Mr. Johnson, in 18 weekly installments, the total sum of $314,134.74 (less withholding) for the period from June 18, 2004 through October 22, 2004. On October 29, 2004, the Registrant will pay Mr. Johnson a lump sum of $700,866 (less withholding). Prior to the Amendment, the Registrant was to have paid Mr. Johnson for the two-year period from June 18, 2004 to June 18, 2006, a total sum equal to two years of his base salary immediately prior to June 18, 2004, less withholding (i.e., 104 weekly payments of $17,451.93 each, less withholding). Under the Amendment, the parties also agreed to shorten the period during which the Registrant was to reimburse Mr. Johnson's cost of continuing medical and dental insurance benefits for him and his eligible dependents, if any, under COBRA from a maximum period of 18 months following June 18, 2004 to the period from June 18, 2004 through October 31, 2004. The Amendment modifies the terms under which Mr. Johnson may use the Registrant's aircraft such that for the period ending on January 15, 2005, he may use such aircraft for no more than 11 total hours of aircraft time under the same rules of -2-
priority as his personal use of such aircraft prior to his retirement. Prior to the amendment, the Retirement Agreement had entitled Mr. Johnson to use the Registrant's aircraft for the period of two years following June 18, 2004 for no more than 35 total hours of aircraft time. Effective November 1, 2004, Mr. Johnson will no longer be precluded from being employed by or connected with Pacific Sunwear. The "no-raid period" applicable to Mr. Johnson under the Retirement Agreement was extended by the Amendment from one year following June 18, 2004 to the period through November 1, 2005. The period during which Mr. Johnson is to be bound by the same standards and duty of loyalty to the Registrant as required by the Registrant's employees and officers, subject to permitted engagement in other employment and related activities not in violation of the Retirement Agreement, was also extended from one year after June 18, 2004 to the period from June 18, 2004 through November 1, 2005. Except as discussed above, the Retirement Agreement remains in effect unmodified. The foregoing summary of the Amendment is qualified by reference to Exhibit 10 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10 [Letterhead of Abercrombie & Fitch Co.] October 6, 2004 Seth R. Johnson 8744 Tartan Fields Drive Dublin, Ohio 43017 Re: Amendment to Retirement Agreement Dear Seth: This letter confirms our agreement to modify the Retirement Agreement between you and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the "Agreement"). You have informed Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the "Company") that you would like to accept employment with Pacific Sunwear effective November 1, 2004. Accordingly, the parties have agreed to modify the Agreement as set forth below, effective November 1, 2004. Except as set forth below, all provisions of the Agreement shall remain unmodified, effective, and enforceable. The parties have agreed to modify paragraph 4 of the Agreement, which is entitled "Severance Benefits Following Retirement Date." It is the intention of the parties that the total amount of severance benefits paid to you pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Agreement shall be reduced by the sum of $800,000.00. Accordingly, the parties have agreed to delete the first sentence of paragraph 4 of the Agreement, and replace it with the following language: "The parties acknowledge that the Company has or will have paid Employee, in 18 normal weekly payroll installments, the total sum of $314,134.74, less ordinary and necessary withholding taxes, for the period commencing June 18, 2004 and ending October 22, 2004. On October 29, 2004, the Company will pay to Employee a lump sum of $700,866.00, less ordinary and necessary withholding taxes." The parties have further agreed to replace the second sentence of paragraph 4 of the Agreement with the following language: "The Company further agrees to reimburse the Employee's cost of continuing medical and dental insurance benefits for Employee and Employee's eligible dependents, if any, under the Comprehensive Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 ("COBRA") through October 31, 2004. The parties agree that the Company will have no further obligation to reimburse Employee's cost of continuing COBRA coverage after October 31, 2004." The parties have agreed to modify paragraph 6 of the Agreement, which is entitled "Use of Company Aircraft", by replacing the first sentence of paragraph 6 with the following language: "Employee shall be entitled to the use of aircraft owned or leased by the Company for the period commencing immediately and ending on January 15, 2005 for no more than 11 total hours of aircraft time and under same rules of priority as Employee's personal use of such aircraft prior to his retirement; provided that
Employee's rights to use of such aircraft shall cease in the event the Company sells or otherwise discontinues its ownership or leasing of, access to, and use of private aircraft." The parties have agreed to modify sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 8, which is entitled "Non-Solicitation", by replacing the second sentence of sub-paragraph 8(b) with the following language: "The "No-Raid Period" means the period beginning on November 1, 2004 and ending November 1, 2005." Effective November 1, 2004, the parties have agreed to modify Appendix A to the Agreement by deleting "Pacific Sunwear" from the list of entities identified in Appendix A. The parties have agreed to modify paragraph 9 of the Agreement, which is entitled "Cooperation, Non-Disparagement, and Indemnity", by replacing the fourth sentence of paragraph 9 of the Agreement with the following language: "Additionally, during the period commencing on the Retirement Date and ending on November 1, 2005, Employee agrees to be bound by and follow the same standards and duty of loyalty to the Company as are required of the Company's employees and officers, except that Employee may engage in other employment and related activities so long as such activities do not violate paragraph 8 of this Agreement." The modifications contained in this letter agreement shall become effective on November 1, 2004. The parties have not agreed to any modification of the Agreement not expressly set forth in this letter. All provisions of the Agreement not discussed in this letter shall remain unmodified, effective, and enforceable.
