He helped the Company focus on many important areas of our business, and we believe that his accomplishments will make the transition in leadership quite smooth. However, there was a difference in approach to the timing and extent of our expansion into certain international markets. While we are solidifying our plans to expand into Canada and the United Kingdom, our entry into other foreign markets will be at a more deliberate pace. "Bob's duties will be assumed by two of our current senior managers, John Lough, Executive Vice President of Logistics and Store Operations, and Mike Kramer, our CFO, who will take on the financial aspects of the COO's position." "My time with Abercrombie & Fitch has been an extraordinary experience. I will miss the many wonderful and talented people here, and wish them the greatest future success," said Mr. Singer.
