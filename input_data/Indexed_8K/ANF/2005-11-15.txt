Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On November 15, 2005, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the "Registrant") issued a news release (the "Release") reporting the Registrant's unaudited financial results for the thirteen weeks (quarterly period) ended October 29, 2005. A copy of the Release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The Registrant also made available as part of the Release a reconciliation between the Registrant's reported GAAP financial measures and the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in the Release; and additional quarterly financial information as of and for the quarterly period ended October 29, 2005 and as of and for the quarterly periods during the fiscal years ended January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003. The reconciliation and the additional quarterly financial information are furnished as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
     The Registrant's management believes that the disclosure of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors or other users of the financial statements since it more accurately reflects the Registrant's results from operations without the impact of the non-recurring charges for the executive severance agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and the legal settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
Item 8.01. Other Events
     In the Release, the Registrant also announced that its Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share in respect of the Registrant's Class A Common Stock. The dividend was declared on November 9, 2005 and is payable on December 20, 2005 to stockholders of record on November 29, 2005.

     (d) Exhibits:

Exhibit 99.1
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) today reported unaudited results which reflected record third quarter net income of $71.6 million and net income per share on a fully-diluted basis of $0.79 for the third quarter ended October 29, 2005, including the after-tax effect of a $0.09 per share non-recurring charge. Excluding the charge, the Company's third quarter non-GAAP net income was $79.8 million, or $0.88 per fully diluted share. A reconciliation to GAAP results of certain non-GAAP measures contained in this release is set forth in the attached schedule.
New Albany, Ohio, November 15, 2005:
Third Quarter Highlights
Mike Jeffries, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said:
"We are pleased with our performance for the third quarter. These strong results reflect the broad momentum and successful differentiation of our brands, confirming our entire organization's dedication to building dominant iconic brands. We are uniquely positioned as the top of mind premium provider of sportswear with brands that appeal to a broad spectrum of customers in the pre-teen through post-collegiate demographic. This is a position we have worked hard to attain, and I can assure you, we will defend vigorously."
 
Third Quarter Financial Results
Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended October 29, 2005 increased 35% to $704.9 million from $520.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended October 30, 2004. The main driver of growth was the total company comparable store sales increase of 25%.
The gross margin rate for the quarter was 66.0%, up 140 basis points compared to last year. The improvement in gross margin was due to improved initial markup combined with a lower markdown rate versus last year.
Stores and Distribution expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased 30 basis points to 35.9% from 36.2%. The Company achieved leverage in store related, direct-to-consumer and distribution expense categories partially offset by increased staff and management in the Company's stores.
Marketing, General and Administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased 270 basis points to 13.9% from 16.6%. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a non-recurring charge of $13.5 million related to an executive severance agreement. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a non-recurring charge of $32.9 million related to a legal settlement. Excluding charges in both periods, MG&A as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.9% from 10.2% compared to last year. The increase in rate is primarily attributed to increased home office payroll.
Net income for the quarter increased 79% to $71.6 million, or $0.79 per share on a fully-diluted basis, from $39.9 million, or $0.42 per share on a fully-diluted basis, for the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
Non-GAAP net income, excluding non-recurring charges, was $79.8 million, or $0.88 per share on a fully-diluted basis in the third quarter of 2005, compared to $60.6 million or $0.64 per share on a fully-diluted basis, in the comparable period of 2004.
2005 Outlook
In August, the Company reaffirmed its guidance for the year of net income per fully-diluted share to be in the range of $3.10 to $3.30, based on a sales plan of approximately $2.7 billion for fiscal 2005, excluding a non-recurring charge to be taken in the third quarter for an executive severance agreement. Based on its year-to-date results, the Company now expects net income per share on a fully-diluted basis, including the non-recurring third quarter charge, to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.40. Excluding the non-recurring charge, the Company now expects net income per share on a fully-diluted basis to be in the range of $3.44 to $3.49.
The Company now expects total capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to be between $270 million and $280 million. The majority of the expenditures are related to new store construction, remodels, and home office investments. These amounts do not reflect construction allowances which are recorded on the balance sheet as a deferred credit as opposed to a reduction in capital spending.
