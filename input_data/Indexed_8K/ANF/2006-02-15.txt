Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On February 14, 2006, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the "Registrant") issued a news release (the "Release") reporting the Registrant's unaudited financial results for the thirteen weeks (quarterly period) ended January 28, 2006 and the fifty-two weeks (fiscal year) ended January 28, 2006. A copy of the Release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
     The Registrant also made available as part of the Release a reconciliation between the Registrant's reported GAAP financial measures and the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in the Release; and made available in conjunction with the Release additional quarterly financial information as of and for the quarterly period ended January 28, 2006 and the other quarterly periods during the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 and as of and for the quarterly periods during the fiscal years ended January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003. The reconciliation and the additional quarterly financial information are furnished as Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
     The Registrant's management believes that the disclosure of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors or other users of the financial statements since the non-GAAP financial measures more accurately reflect the Registrant's results from operations without the impact of the non-recurring charges for the executive severance agreement in fiscal 2005 and the legal settlement in fiscal 2004 and also assist in the calculation of net income per share growth guidance provided excluding the impact of expected FAS 123 (R) expense.
     The Registrant's management conducted a conference call on February 14, 2006, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, to review the Registrant's financial results for the thirteen weeks and the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006. Additionally, the Registrant's management addressed plans for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2007 on the conference call. A copy of the transcript of the conference call is furnished as Exhibit 99.4 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events
     In the Release, the Registrant also announced that its Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share in respect of the Registrant's Class A Common Stock. The dividend was declared on February 13, 2006 and is payable on March 21, 2006 to stockholders of record on February 28, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) today reported unaudited results which reflected record net income of $164.6 million and net income per share on a fully-diluted basis of $1.80 for the fourth quarter ended January 28, 2006.
New Albany, Ohio, February 14, 2006:
The Company also reported net income of $334.0 million and net income per share on a fully-diluted basis of $3.66 for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006.

Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
Mike Jeffries, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said:
"Fiscal 2005 was an exceptional year for Abercrombie & Fitch, as we achieved record sales and earnings while enhancing the quality of our brands through strategic business investments. In addition to excellent financial results, fiscal 2005 marked the successful opening of our Fifth Avenue flagship store as well as the Company's initial expansion into international markets with the opening of Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister stores in Canada. Our ongoing commitment to building quality in every aspect of the business gives me the confidence that we will continue our success through 2006 and beyond."
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2005 Financial Results
Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended January 28, 2006 increased 40% to $961.4 million compared to $687.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended January 29, 2005. Total Company comparable store sales increased 28% for the fourth quarter. Net sales for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006 increased 38% to $2.785 billion versus $2.021 billion last year. Total Company comparable store sales increased 26% for fiscal 2005.
The gross profit rate for the quarter was 66.5%, increasing 20 basis points compared to last year's rate of 66.3%. The increase in rate reflects an improved shrink rate and initial markup with little change in the markdown rate versus last year. For fiscal 2005, the gross profit rate was 66.5% versus 66.4% last year, an increase of 10 basis points.
Stores and distribution expense for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, decreased 210 basis points to 30.5% versus 32.6% last year. The decrease in rate versus last year resulted from the Company's ability to leverage fixed costs due to significant comparable store sales increases, partially offset by increased store management and loss prevention programs. For fiscal 2005, stores and distribution expense, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 35.9% versus 36.5% last year.
Marketing, general, and administrative expense for the fourth quarter, as a percentage of sales, decreased 120 basis points to 8.4% from 9.6% last year. The decrease in rate versus last year resulted from leveraging of marketing expense and home office payroll, partially offset by increased legal expense. For fiscal 2005, MG&A expense was 11.3% of sales, 160 basis points lower than last year's rate of 12.9%.
Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 57% to $267.5 million compared to $170.2 million last year. For fiscal 2005, operating income was $542.7 million versus $347.6 million last year, an increase of 56%.
Net income for the quarter increased 58% to $164.6 million versus $104.3 million last year. For fiscal 2005, net income increased 54% to $334.0 million versus $216.4 million last year.
Net income per share on a fully-diluted basis for the fourth quarter was $1.80 versus $1.15, representing an increase of 57% versus last year. For fiscal 2005, net income per share on a fully-diluted basis increased 61% to $3.66 versus $2.28 last year. Net income per fully-diluted share for fiscal 2005 includes the effect of a third quarter non-recurring charge of $0.09 on an after-tax basis. Net income per fully-diluted share for fiscal 2004 includes the effect of a non-recurring charge of $0.27 on an after-tax basis.
Fiscal 2006 Outlook
The Company recently annualized strong comparable store sales growth which started in January of 2005, reporting a 33% comparable store sales increase in January of 2006. The Company believes the strong comparable store sales growth in January was due to a continuation of strong sales momentum, gift card redemptions, and the benefit of unseasonably warm temperatures.
 
Consequently, the Company believes that while it can sustain positive comparable store sales increases, the increases will not be at the level reported over the past 13 months. The Company expects net income per fully-diluted share, for the first-half of fiscal 2006, to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.28, including a charge of approximately $0.08 attributable to the adoption of FAS 123(R). On a comparable non-GAAP basis, excluding 2006 expense related to FAS 123 (R), this would represent a 21% to 26% increase on a net income per share basis compared to last year. Reconciliation to GAAP measures of certain non-GAAP measures contained in this release is set forth in the attached schedule.
The Company expects total capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 to be between $405 million and $415 million with approximately $260 million of this amount allocated to new store construction, store remodels, conversions, and improvements to existing stores, with the remainder related to home office and distribution center investments.
For fiscal 2006, the Company expects to increase gross square-footage by approximately 11% primarily through the addition of 64 Hollister Co. stores, 19 abercrombie stores, 12 Abercrombie & Fitch stores and eight RUEHL stores.
Other Developments
For fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares of Class A Common Stock as part of its stock repurchase program. The Company has 5.7 million shares remaining under its existing repurchase authorization.
On February 13, 2006, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share on the Class A Common Stock of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. payable on March 21, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2006.
During fiscal 2005, the Company paid dividends totaling $0.60 per share to shareholders representing a 20% increase versus total dividends of $0.50 per share paid in fiscal 2004.
The Company operated 361 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 164 abercrombie stores, 318 Hollister stores, and eight RUEHL stores as of 2005 fiscal year-end. The Company operates e-commerce websites at www.abercrombie.com, www.abercrombiekids.com, and www.hollisterco.com.

Good afternoon.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $961.4 million, increasing 40% over last year's fourth quarter sales of $687.3 million, with comparable store sales up 28%. For the quarter, comps by brand were as follows: in the adult business, Abercrombie & Fitch, comparable store sales increased 18%. Men's comps increased by mid-teens. Women's increased by high-teens.
In the kids' business, Abercrombie, comps increased 59% with boy's comps increasing by mid-30s and girls increasing by high 60s. Hollister same-store sales increased 34%, compared to last year with Dude's comps increasing by low 30s and Betty's increasing by mid-30s. On a regional basis, the business was consistent with each region, generating comparable store sales increases greater than 25%. This goal, 2005 net sales were $2.785 billion versus $2.021 billion last year, an increase of 38%. Comparable store sales increased 26% in fiscal 2005.
The fourth quarter gross profit rate was 66.5%, 20 basis points higher than last year's rate of 66.3%. The increase reflects an improved shrink rate and initial markup with little change to the markdown rate versus last year. For fiscal 2005, the gross profit

rate was 66.5%, versus 66.4%, an increase of 10 basis points versus last year. The gross profit rate increase reflects higher initial markup and a reduction in shrink, partially offset by a slightly higher markdown rate.
We ended the fourth quarter with inventories up 59% per gross square foot at a cost versus last year. This is less than the guidance we provided on our third quarter conference call, when we estimated that year-end inventory per square foot would reflect slightly less than the 87% increase reported at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Going forward, we expect increases in inventory levels to continue to moderate, ending the first quarter of 2006 with a slightly lower increase per foot at cost when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Stores and distribution expense for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, decreased 210 basis points to 30.5% versus 32.6% last year. The decrease in rate versus last year resulted from the Company's ability to leverage fixed costs, due to significant comparable store sales increases, partially offset by increased store management and loss prevention programs.
For the year, stores and distribution expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 35.9% versus 36.5% last year. The decreased end rate versus last year resulted from the Company's ability to leverage fixed costs due to significant comparable store sales, increases, partially offset by higher store payroll costs.
For the fourth quarter, marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased 120 basis points as a percentage of sales to 8.4% from 9.6% last year. The decrease in rate versus last year resulted from leveraging of marketing expense and home office payroll, partially offset by increased legal expense. For the year, MG&A expense was 11.3% of sales, 160 basis points lower than last year's rate of 12.9%. Excluding previously-reported nonrecurring charges in fiscal 2004 and the third quarter of fiscal 2005, MG&A expense as a percentage of sales was flat to last year.
For the fourth quarter, operating income increased 57% to $267.5 million compared to $170.2 million last year. For the year, operating income was $542.7 million versus $347.6 million last year, an increase of 56%. Net income for the quarter increased 58% to $164.6 million versus $104.3 million last year. Fiscal 2005 net income increased 54% to $334 million versus $216.4 million last year.
Fourth quarter net income per share on a fully diluted basis was $1.80, versus $1.15, representing an increase of 57% versus last year. For fiscal 2005, net income per share on a fully diluted basis increased 61% to $3.66  to $3.66 versus $2.28 last year. Net income per share includes the after-tax effect of previously-reported nonrecurring charges of $0.09 per fully diluted share in 2005 and $0.27 per fully diluted share in 2004.
During fiscal 2005, we repurchased 1.8 million shares in the open market as part of our previously-authorized share repurchase program. There are currently 5.7 million shares remaining under existing repurchase authorization. During fiscal 2005, we paid dividends totaling $0.60 per share to shareholders, a 20% increase compared to last year's total dividends of $0.50. The board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share, payable on March 21, 2006 to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2006.
During the quarter, we opened six Abercrombie & Fitch stores, two Abercrombie kids' stores, 17 Hollister stores and 2 RUEHL stores. We ended fiscal 2005 with a total of 361 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 164 Abercrombie kids' stores, 318 Hollister stores and 8 RUEHL stores. For fiscal 2006, we plan to open approximately 12 new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 19 new Abercrombie kids' stores, 64 new Hollister stores and 8 new RUEHL stores. Total square footage is expected to grow by approximately 11% in fiscal 2006.
For fiscal 2006, our planned capital expenditures will be between $405 million and $415 million. Approximately $260 million of this amount is allocated to new store construction, remodels, conversions and improvements to existing stores with the remainder related to home office and distribution center investments.
Now I would like to discuss our financial targets for the first half of the current fiscal year. We have decided to provide guidance on a seasonal basis since we believe there is more clarity in the near-term. As you will recall, we revised our guidance several

times last year as business trends became more pronounced. Thus, we will provide an outlook for the fall season when we report our results for the second quarter.
The Company recently annualized strong comparable store sales growth which started in January of 2005. Reporting a 33% comparable store sales increase in January of 2006. We believe the strong comparable store sales growth in January was due to a continuation of strong sales momentum, gift card redemptions and the benefit of unseasonably warm temperatures. Consequently, while we can sustain positive comp store sales increases, the increases will not be at the level reported over the past 13 months.
We expect net income per fully diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2006 to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.28, including a charge of approximately $0.08 attributable to the adoption of FAS 123-R. On a comparable non-GAAP basis, excluding expense related to FAS 123-R, this would represent a 21 to 26% increase on a net income per-share basis compared to last year.
Now Mike will comment on the business.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Good afternoon.
Fiscal 2005 was a very successful year. Each of our brands exhibited strong growth which allowed the business to generate record sales and earnings. Our success during this period is the result of our ongoing commitment to protecting and enhancing the long-term strengths of our brands. To do so requires a delicate balance between reporting near-term profit growth and investing in the organization.
Never has this been more evident than in fiscal 2005. We made essential investments throughout the year, initially focusing on the store's organization, where we drastically improved the shopping experience for our customers and later in the year at the home office by broadening the merchandising and design organization. Despite these major investments, we still reported a 43% increase in operating income and a 48% increase in net income per share for fiscal 2005, excluding one-time charges in both years. By business, each of our brands performed very well throughout fiscal 2005.
For the year, the adult business, Abercrombie & Fitch, achieved a comparable store sales increase of 18%, demonstrating excellent growth for mature business. The business was consistently strong throughout the year with both the mens and womens businesses performing very well. With limited opportunity to see for additional domestic mall locations, expanding the A&F business will be driven by opening select flagship locations combined with international expansion.
As many of you know, we opened the first Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store on 5th Avenue during the fourth quarter. The store performed extremely well throughout the fourth quarter, exceeding our initial sales productivity expectations. We also opened our first Abercrombie & Fitch stores in Canada during the quarter. The stores are off to an amazing start with productivity above that of our average U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores. In addition, we are planning to open flagship stores in the Grove at Farmer's Market in Los Angeles this summer, followed by the London flagship store in the spring of 2007.
During the fourth quarter, we opened 3 Hollister stores in Canada. These stores are also exceeding our expectations with productivity above that of our average U.S. Hollister stores. At this point, we are only halfway to Hollister's domestic store potential. Over the next few years, I expect the brand's iconic status to continue to strengthen. The results achieved at that brand, however, demonstrate how solidly this concept performs, achieving net sales in fiscal 2005 of approximately $1 billion, and sales of $528 per foot.
For fiscal 2005, net sales increased 72% with comparable store sales increasing 29%. With a comparable store sales increase of 54% in fiscal 2005, the Abercrombie brand not only generated the greatest productivity increase, but also had had a gross profit

rate above both Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister. While it is unrealistic to expect the brand to sustain its recent dramatic comparable store sales increases, we are convinced that the kids' business will continue to achieve solid results.
I'm pleased with the progress made during fiscal 2005 with the RUEHL business. When we initially introduced the business last fall, I do not believe the assortment reflected the casual sportswear trends consistent in our other businesses. Given our understanding that trend transcends age, we have adjusted the assortment to reflect more casual trends. Since then, the business has responded to this adjustment and I'm very pleased with the brand's positioning at this point. The business performed well during the fourth quarter, and we are still expecting RUEHL to be profitable by the end of office 2007. fiscal 2007.
After such an amazing year, we're faced with the challenge of improving what has become a hugely-successful business. While it is difficult to predict what business trends for fiscal 2006 will be, it is certain that productivity increases will moderate during the year, based upon the extraordinary comparable store sales increases achieved in fiscal 2005. Despite this challenge, we will operate the business as we always have. We will protect and enhance the brands, thus ensuring our long-term success.
Now we are available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question so that we can speak with as many callers as possible. After everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you.

My question is this, I guess, in terms of the sales gains and the productivity gains that you achieved this year, maybe Mike and Mike both commenting on it, coming out of the year for the year-end total, can you give us a sense for how it was split between the comp being driven by number of transactions and AUR increases and how we ended the year? And what you see as your biggest opportunity going forward? Will it be driving the transactions in the store? Do you still have opportunities for your AUR mix?

Let's take a look, Mike, do you want to comment?

Yes, I will comment. Then I will let Mike talk more qualitatively. We saw an increase in our transaction in our stores as well as our AUR. I would say that it's roughly a 50/50 split. It terms of is there  we believe that the future growth is going to come from transaction growth. Having said that, I think that we will take some opportunistic pricing change as we see fit, but we don't see that as of right now. Do you have anything to add, Mike?

No. Well stated.

Hi, thanks, let me add my congratulations to everybody, too. Really terrific quarter. One follow-up and one quickie. The follow-up was just, Mike, you said taking opportunistic pricing increases as you see fit. Going forward, can you just elaborate on what that means or kind of clarify that?
Tom Lennox
- Abercrombie & Fitch  IR, Corporate Communications
Let me speak for Mike, that would be in the Abercrombie & Fitch brand as we have seen putting a lot more quality into a specific product, we have taken some prices up as we saw fit. For instance, the basic polo in Abercrombie & Fitch, the price was raised from $39 to $49 last fall because we built so much into the product and saw we could sustain those kinds of increases. Those kinds of things will happen within the Abercrombie & Fitch brand. I don't expect many of them to happen because I'm very happy with the  with the price levels there and we clearly, in Hollister and kids, will stay exactly where we are in term of price.

Thank you, John.

Kimberly Greenberger
- Citigroup  Analyst
Great, thank you. I had a question on your CapEx numbers for 2006. They were a little higher than we were looking for. If you could just give us the thumb detail around that and why you're seeing such an acceleration into CapEx, that would be very helpful?
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Yes, Kimberly. This is Mike Kramer. I'd be glad to answer that. As we've seen, we've seen tremendous growth in all of our brands and we have to continue to build infrastructure for continued growth. As we indicated,260 million is going to be targeted toward store build, store remodels, on top of that, there is $80 million that we're going to spend building another distribution center here on our campus in new Albany, Ohio. We're also going to be investing significantly in our IT infrastructure as we continue to grow and see needs that we need to enhance our business. More importantly be be able to drive more efficiencies in our business as we go forward.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
I will comment beyond that, we're initiating an investment program in the Abercrombie & Fitch fleet, that I'm very excited about. As you know, we  we have a fleet of stores that really started in 1994 and we continue to update them rather than to go for total remodels. We are  we are adding some really exciting elements to those stores over the next six months. We're spending approximately $30 million on the Abercrombie & Fitch fleet to update it, to really enhance the store experience. We're spending $10 million in Hollister, which is essentially an expansion of the video wall system that is currently in that  in that chain. So, between the two chains, $40 million to enhance the customer experience.

Jeff Black

Yes, thanks a lot. Can you talk a little bit, Mike, about where you see opportunities for some further expense leverage? I know we got some in this quarter that was impressive, but what's the track going out? And will that potentially lead to some operating margin improvement in 06 versus 05, given that we're still below peak margin? Thanks.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Well, we're going to continue to see some operating margin improvement at the store level, which we've indicated in the past. We're continuously focusing on the same areas that I've discussed in the past, primarily store payroll. And we're continuing to do that. Now, in terms of MG&A, we probably will not be leveraging MG&A until latter part of this year as Mike and I both indicated we're going to continue to invest in the business. We are not going to invest in the business at the rates that we did in the previous spring, but we will be continuing to invest in the business.
Now, one of the areas that we're going to be investing in this business is IT. And those investments are, in turn, going to turn around and be able to drive some efficiencies throughout the organization, in terms of head count. And so in short, we're focused on the same areas we talked about in the past, in terms of driving efficiency and then we're also going to try to have technology help us in that capacity.

Joe Tekkits
- Wachovia Securities  Analyst
I have a question, how are you?
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Good.
Joe Tekkits
- Wachovia Securities  Analyst
I think the biggest controversy amongst the Street is your inventory level, my opinion, anyway. So, you know, I was wondering if you could just give us some more detail on the subject, maybe how clean it is, but even more importantly, some details on how you're planning it going forward, other than what you've given us, maybe when the turns are going to start increasing, you know, again, something like that?
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Let me kick that off, Joe. Our spring inventories on an average store  our fall inventories on an average store basis to last year was  what percent?
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Down slightly.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Down to last year, slightly down to last year. They were clean last year and on increased volume levels, we think they are extraordinarily clean. So, in terms of seasonal fashion merchandise, extraordinarily clean.
I think the whole inventory is very clean and let me take this opportunity again to discuss how we look at our inventories. We plan them in different segments. We plan basic denim as one category, where we've said that our mark down risk is appreciably less than fashion merchandise. Those inventories are extraordinarily well-balanced at this point. You will see those inventories will be more  we'll be more efficient with those inventories as we move from this season into summer and into fall.
The fashion basic component of our business is those  back up to denim, the denim inventories, as you know, we've invested in heavily. We're very happy with those inventories and their levels of  levels will, in fact, moderate as we go through the year. The second category is fashion basics, which includes polo shirts, applique logo T-shirts. Those inventories are up to last year, are on plan and extraordinarily clean.
Third classification is personal care, up to last year, business performing very well, extraordinarily clean inventories, we've cleaned out any non go-forward fragrances. The fourth category is fashion. This is the category that we control very, very tightly because there is markdown risk in fashion. Fashion consists of anything that has to mark down within a season. We would consider that to be  to include some denim items, as we've said in the past. We take markdowns on fashion denim, as you saw, we took markdowns on embellished denim, we took markdowns on some fashion back pocket denims, and in the future, we will continue to take markdowns on fashion denim.

That would include our  our Ezra Fitch line, which is a premium denim line, but that is included in the fashion equation of our business. We plan that inventory with a downside in terms of sales to protect our margin. So, we  I'm very, very pleased with our inventories, how clean they are and how we are projecting them go-forward.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Yes, this is Mike Kramer. I want to add to that, while I know the controversy out there exists, I don't understand it, given the large success that we've actually seen over the last three quarters. Again, to state our past, in terms of the strategy, you did see a significant amount of increase year-over-year, two to three quarters ago. We believe that the increased presentation in our store also added to the sales volume and the experience within the store.
Again, as you continue to see on a quarter by quarter basis, we indicated on this particular quarter, an increase of 59% on a cost basis, on a unit basis that's in the low 40s. We saw a 33% comp coming out of the quarter. And as we've also stated, we will continue to see moderation in that particular percentage.

Paul Lejuez

Thanks. Mike Jeffries, as you reflect back on this past year, how you spend your time versus prior years, can you maybe just talk about some of the differences, from 05 versus 04? And also how you're thinking about it going forward, if there are any changes in demand on your time? Thanks.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
I  I spend my time as most of you know on  primarily on merchandising and design in the business. And have done so, will continue to do so. I've spent more time this year on  I would say managing the total businesses as  as  as we run the business with a  with a readership group, very focused, disciplined kind of way, but the majority of my time is still spent on merchandising, design, marketing the business, where I think I can make the biggest difference.
We have an extraordinarily talented leadership team, functional leadership, hugely strong in this business and  and the fact that we have very hands-on control  or I do at this point, I think has been hugely beneficial to this business. We as a team are marching in the same direction, and that gives me a lot of confidence in  in the future.

A couple of quickies. One is, will you comment on your comfort with Q1 consensus? Which I think is $0.59 or $0.60. And what's a realistic growth rate for the store and distribution expense in Q1? And then last one would be in what quarter should inventory growth be in line with sales growth? In dollars.
Tom Lennox
- Abercrombie & Fitch  IR, Corporate Communications
Stacy, I'd like to just start  this is Tom Lennox  we'd rather not comment on consensus. We provided our own range and we'd like to stick with that. Part 2... Mike?
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Oh, in terms of the store and distribution, in terms of Q1, in terms of growth rate, we're actually going to see, again, as I said earlier on the call, we're actually going to see leverage, but in terms of growth rate, you're going to probably see the consistent cost with regards to the distribution center but in terms of on a store-level basis, I would build into your model a certain amount of the variable on a per-store basis.
I don't want to really comment other than that. I mean we opened indicated that in that particular line item, we believe that there will be leverage, I just don't want to give any more guidance as compared to that. Again, you know, there is variability with regards to the payroll, as long as you have modeled a really good mix between our fix and variable, you should be able to nail that number, providing you nail the sales.

Can we get a little bit of an update on the Internet business and specifically as it relates to the international side of it? And if you can talk about that across the brands, Kids, Hollister and, of course, the core Abercrombie brand.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Well, in terms of e-commerce, we actually have recently, in terms of the quarter, we've actually seen a pretty sizeable increase in our sales year-over-year. Not to the stent we've seen in our four wall stores, but we are recently pleased with the recent results. As we've indicated on the past calls, we've indicated some brand protection initiatives that have impacted our international sales.
In terms of international, we've actually seen a slight decline because of that. But we will start anniversarying those initiatives that we put in place in Q2. So, we  you know, anticipate a turn-from that perspective. But again, we're very pleased with the results that we saw in Q4 in our direct-to-consumer business. On a by brand basis, I would say that the year-over-year growth was probably consistent with regards to our stores.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
When you look at what 
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
On a same-store basis.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
When you look at what we're doing from a brand protection standpoint, just as a point of reference, Marni, is we're reducing the content of the sales items on the Internet. I think what we've seen is some of the international customers have been buying in fairly large quantities. We've also limited the quantities that they can order just to protect the brand from being exposed to the secondary market.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
I think this is just a really good time to state again what we've gone public with. The amount of money that  and effort we're putting in to protecting these brands, not only for the domestic growth of the brands, but for international growth. It's a really serious, serious enterprise of ours at this point.

Hey. Mike, just the MG&A line was actually sequentially down in the fourth quarter, is there anything to note there? And you talked about continuing to invest in the first half and then level out. So, should we be thinking the base is the fourth quarter number? And then the second question is, a year ago you were talking about closing the kids' business. Now you're starting to open.

Mike Jeffries

Okay. Okay. Mike can go on.
Mike Kramer

Yeah, let me address the latter part of your question first. We, you know, we are very excited about our kids' business, extremely excited and we actually think that the results that we've seen have really opened us unto probably another 100-plus potential locations that we can expand the Abercrombie kids brand. We're extremely excited about it. It let's talk about MG&A expense in terms of the decreased rate. This was driven by the fact that there were a significant amount of one-time adjustments in Q3.
Let me remind you of some of those. The severance package related to Bob Singer, which was roughly $13.5 million and then we also had a fixed asset write-off of $2 million. If you take those out of the equation, it's roughly flat. In terms of on a go-forward basis, you're going to see a slight increase as we continue to  to add and invest in our business. I indicated that we're going to invest some in IT and we're going to continue to invest in Mike's design and merchandise business. You're just not going to see it anywhere near the rates you've seen it in the spring of this last year.

Just had a follow-up question about IT. Can you talk a little bit of what types of initiatives you might be looking at? And then as far as options expense, can I assume that $0.08 is equally spread out between the two quarters? And is that kind of the run rate for Q3 and Q4?
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
It's actually a spread of FAS 123 is actually a 55/45 split. You will see the run rate drop a little bit after that due to some vesting of some of the stock options that were outstanding. Types of initiatives with regards to IT, there's going to be a significant amount of initiatives with regards to IT as we've grown our business. Prior to last year, we didn't invest significantly in our IT infrastructure.
With the significant growth that we saw and actually exceeded our expectations, we've seen some cracks that we're actually going to invest in and really take advantage of the significant growth in our business and profitability and reinvest in the business so that we can move the business forward. In terms of specifics, I don't really want to get into that, but rest assured we're going to be monitoring those investments, ensuring that we're getting a pay back.

Great job. Great job on the inventories. Everything looks great. Just a couple of questions, Mike, when I think about how you drove comps in 05, I guess it was a combination of great fashion, higher average unit retails and I think to some extent, the investment in the higher payrolls, how do you  how do you look at driving comps in 06? Do you see as much growth from average unit retails? Or will you up the marketing expense? Will you alter the in-store service or experience levels? And how do you feel about the level of fashion newness in the business going forward versus how you felt about it last year? And then I have a question for Mike Kramer, as well. Thanks.
Mike Jeffries

Okay. AUR, we're  I'm very satisfied, Janet, with where we are in terms of the retails by brand.

Okay.

And we don't  as you know, drive the business with marketing. We drive it with fashion and the in-store experience. And I would hope we're getting better at the in-store experience. We have invested a lot more there, we did last year. But we should start to see some efficiencies with  with that expenditure and we're getting better at  at running the stores. I think our systems are better, we're  we're running an operation that does a better job of getting goods to the floor, reading the customers. I think the stores operate just a lot better this time this year than last year.

Great, thanks, good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if in light of the revised CapEx guidance and some of your more opportunistic goals for growing Will Abercrombie and some of the international plans, if that has any implications for the cash on the balance sheet, how you will use that? I know in the past you had given us a target of cash you'd like to maintain and you're certainly well ahead of that. Can you give us some thought on how we can think about uses of the cash and whether or not that target has moved? Thanks very much.
Tom Lennox
- Abercrombie & Fitch  IR, Corporate Communications
I guess I can answer that. The target has not changed. I mean Mike has always indicated that we will be between $300 and $350 million in terms of cash. Obviously in terms of the increased CapEx, we feel comfortable with that. It's  it's, you know, going to allow us to grow the business more. And we talk  we've talked about in terms of our excess cash, the strategy has not changed to the extent that we have excess cash. We may go back out on the market.

If you were looking out with a crystal ball, what you think and do you think that once you've penetrated the domestic market with Hollister, is that  could that also be an international brand? And then your product's been so hot  I know I'm not is supposed to ask a lot of questions, but I never ask questions! If the loyalty  if you have thought of having a loyalty program, I know you haven't needed one and you probably don't, but just anything there?

I thought you were going to ask when we were finally going to get Washington Square remodeled.

FINAL TRANSCRIPT
Feb. 14. 2006 / 4:30PM, ANF  Q4 2005 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. Earnings Conference Call
Jeff Black
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
Well, that's a huge store! [ laughter ]
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
It's on the way!
Jeff Black
- Lehman Brothers  Analyst
I know!
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
It's on the way! Clearly, there is an opportunity for Hollister internationally. We  we  we see that with the opening in Canada and it's always been our goal that we would go there after  after we learned our lessons with A&F. But clearly that's  that is a huge opportunity.
Loyalty program, we had a loyalty program of sorts, that was not financial, but that was kind of  kind of a little bit financial, within  within Hollister and we've discontinued it because it just was not effective in driving the business there. At all. To respond to the European profitability, I will turn it over to Mike.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
I can actually handle that. Again, we're working through our strategy for Europe but if I had to be cornered, I would actually see that the profitability in Europe will be consistent with U.S. Maybe slightly higher. As everybody knows, the labor costs in Europe are higher. As well as our rent on a gross square footage basis. However, the offset to that is the fact that due to the iconic nature of our brands, we may be able to charge higher price than we do in the United States. So, again, those are things to come. But again, we've  we, you know, I think that the expansion into Europe is definitely going to be even or accretive to our current operating margin.

We go back now to Kimberly Greenberger of Citigroup.
Kimberly Greenberger
- Citigroup  Analyst
Thanks, I just had a quick follow-up on the fourth quarter comp number. If you could break the comp increase down by transaction and average unit retail or average dollar sale by brand, that would be really helpful. Thanks.
Tom Lennox
- Abercrombie & Fitch  IR, Corporate Communications
Yeah, in Q4, Kimberly, the transactions in the adult business were up 12 and the kids business they were up 50. In the Hollister business, they were up 23. And then average transactions value is what we'd prefer to offer and average transactions in the adult business were up 11. Average transactions in the kids' business were up 9 and then at Hollister up 10.

Barbara Wyckoff
- Buckingham Research Group  Analyst
I wanted to talk about RUEHL. You've modified to casual. Have you adjusted your thoughts regarding the accessories and handbags as a result of the shift to more casual? Can you talk about how the accessories are performing versus plan? And I guess I have a follow-up question after that.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Okay, that's  it's a really good question, Barbara. The answer to the question is yes, we are clearly adjusting the handbags to a more casual attitude and assortment and because they have to  they have to live together, I think our handbags have been  have been beautiful, but a little serious for the business that we want to run. I think we have most to learn in the handbag business. We're committed to that business. We're selling a lot of handbags but we  we have to continue to adjust it to the handbags to more casual attitude. We're sportswear specialists, we're not handbag specialists, but we're investing in the business and we'll get it.
Barbara Wyckoff
- Buckingham Research Group  Analyst
Great.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Thanks.
Barbara Wyckoff
- Buckingham Research Group  Analyst
The other question I have, is in the past Hollister operating margins have run higher than the core A&F. Did this happen in 2005, as well? I presume it did.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Yeah, Hollister, in terms of comparison to adult for the total year, it remains the same. Hollister is higher on an operating margin than adult  gross margin, excuse me. Slightly.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Slightly. It's slightly higher.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Right.
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Very slightly.

Dorothy Lakner
- CIBC World Markets  Analyst
Thanks, good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask, also, about RUEHL. You had talked, I think, Mike, last quarter about the difference in performance between the different locations that you have opened. I think you called it sort of a tiered performance. Some were terrific, some were good, one, I think you talked about, was, your expression was God-awful, I think, but I just wondered if you  you know, have been able to change things there, if the performance of those stores were more in line and in terms of the eight units you're going to open this year, are you trying anything different? Are they going to be all mall locations? If you could just give a little bit more color on what you're doing with RUEHL this year?
Mike Jeffries
- Abercrombie & Fitch  Chairman and CEO
Of course, of course they're going to be mall locations because we're a mall business. That's where we do business. We continue to have five terrific stores and one  I have to admit failure  is still bad, and we have not  although it's improving, it's not improving at a fast enough rate. All of the  all of the RUEHL stores are increasing their penetration to the A&F stores in their existing malls, but clearly there  we have one that is still poor in relation to the volume potential in the mall and one's fair and five are really good. So, I can't report to you that the poor has gotten really good, but we're working on it.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
I would add to that in terms of the 8 sites in 2006, we're very, very excited about our real estate for the RUEHL brand in 2006. And the new stores that we bring on operate at really high penetrations to the A&F stores. So, we're  we're  we're very jazzed about RUEHL.

Hi. I had two more questions. First, if you could talk a little bit about the sales push forward at the end of fiscal 05, relative to peak? And if

Janet Kloppenburg
- JJK Research  Analyst
And when you think you will get to peak  or if you will be able to get back to peak? And also, Mike, if you could talk about the investment that was made in the higher store payroll, what the degree of success was in that? Did you see continuing having a higher store payroll level or what refinements you might make to that program? Thank you.
Mike Kramer
- Abercrombie & Fitch  CFO
Two very good questions, Janet. First, I'm actually glad you brought up the sales per square foot. Our peak was generated back in 1999 of $505 per square foot. For the year, a  all of our brands, on average, generate $464 per square foot, well on a glide path toward that peak. The one thing I do want to point out, though, is the Hollister brand has exceeded that peak at $528 per square foot. So, we're very excited about that brand, as well as all of our brands on the way to beating and exceeding that peak back in 1999.
In terms of the investments, in terms of our higher store payroll, absolutely do we feel that it's  that it's paid off. The impact program has  has paid off significantly. Obviously the floor coverage is paid off significantly, as well, in terms of sales. As we've also indicated, several comments in terms of our script, with that we saw a reduced shrink which we think that the enhanced customer service actually added to that. So, we're really excited about that.
On a go-forward basis, do we think that payroll will be at the  at the same levels that we have today? The payroll will be at a level consistent with the sales that are needed to get the efficiencies that we want. We're continually looking at driving the same customer experience at a lower dollar. So, we're going to keep doing that. But I've got to tell you these have paid off and we're very excited about the success that we've seen and we hope that you've seen that same customer experience. A lot of people have in the past year. Which has been extraordinary.
