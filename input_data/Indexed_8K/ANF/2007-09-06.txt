The following factors, in addition to those included in the disclosure under the heading "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS" in "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS" of A&F's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2007, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause actual results for the 2007 fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward-looking statements included in this Press Release or otherwise made by management: changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; postal rate increases and changes; paper and printing costs; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; ability to hire, train and retain associates; and the outcome of pending litigation. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability are difficult to predict. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Press Release will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company, or any other person, that the objectives of the Company will be achieved.

Exhibit 99.2
This is Tom Lennox, Vice President of Corporate Communications of Abercrombie & Fitch. The following is a summary of our sales results for the fiscal month ended September 1, 2007.
Before I begin, I remind you that any forward-looking statements I may make are subject to the Safe Harbor Statement found in our SEC filings.
Net sales for the four-week period ended September 1, 2007, were $425.4 million compared to $351.3 million for the four-week period ended August 26, 2006. Total Company direct-to-consumer net sales increased to $20.6 million for the four-week period ended September 1, 2007, a 54% increase over sales for the four-week period ended August 26, 2006. August comparable store sales increased 6% for the four-week period ended September 1, 2007, compared to the four-week period ended September 2, 2006.
August comps benefited from the shift of tax free holiday dates in Texas and Florida from Fiscal July into Fiscal August, an event we highlighted when we reported July sales. Excluding sales for the stores affected by this shift, we estimate that total company comp store sales would have increased 1% for August.
By brand, Abercrombie & Fitch comparable store sales increased 5%. Men's comps increased by a low double digit; women's comps increased by a low single digit. Transactions per store increased 7%; average transaction value increased 3%. Transaction metrics compare the four-week period ended September 1, 2007 to the four-week period ended August 26, 2006.
In the kids business, abercrombie, comparable store sales increased 12%. Boys comps increased by mid teens; girls comps increased by a low double digit. Transactions per store increased 7%; average transaction value increased 2%.
Hollister comparable store sales increased 6%. Dudes comps increased by a low double digit; Bettys comps increased by a low single digit. Transactions per store increased 5%; average transaction value declined 1%.
RUEHL comparable store sales increased 2%. Men's comps declined by a high single digit; women's comps increased by a mid single digit. Transactions per store increased 10%; average transaction value decreased 10%.
By region, comps were strongest in the Southwest and South, and weakest in the West.
