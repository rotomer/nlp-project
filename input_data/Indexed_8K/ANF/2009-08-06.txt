A&F cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Press Release or made by management of A&F involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Company's control.

RISK FACTORS" of A&F's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009, in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the Company's financial performance and could cause actual results for the 2009 fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any of the forward-looking statements included in this Press Release or otherwise made by management: current financial crisis and general economic conditions; changes in consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences; the effects of political and economic events and conditions domestically and in foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or war; the impact of competition and pricing; changes in weather patterns; postal rate increases and changes; paper and printing costs; market price of key raw materials; ability to source product from its global supplier base; political stability; currency and exchange risks and changes in existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas; availability of suitable store locations at appropriate terms; ability to develop new merchandise; ability to hire, train and retain associates; and the outcome of pending litigation.

Exhibit 99.2
This is Eric Cerny, Manager of Investor Relations for Abercrombie & Fitch. The following is a summary of our sales results for the fiscal month ended August 1, 2009.
Before I begin, I remind you that any forward-looking statements I may make are subject to the Safe Harbor Statement found in our SEC filings.
Net sales for the four-week period ended August 1, 2009, were $236.0 million, a 22% decrease from net sales of $303.1 million for the four-week period ended August 2, 2008. Total Company direct-to-consumer net sales were $16.2 million for the four-week period ended August 1, 2009, an 11% decrease from sales for the four-week period ended August 2, 2008. July comparable store sales decreased 28%.
By brand, Abercrombie & Fitch comparable store sales were down 25%. Men's comps were down by a low twenty; women's comps were down by a high twenty. Transactions per average store decreased 20%; average transaction value decreased 6%.
 
For abercrombie, comparable store sales were down 27%. Guys comps were down by a high teen; girls comps were down by a low thirty. Transactions per average store decreased 19%; average transaction value decreased 8%.
Hollister comparable store sales were down 32%. Dudes comps were down by a high twenty; Bettys comps were down by a mid thirty. Transactions per average store decreased 20%; average transaction value decreased 9%.
RUEHL comparable store sales were down 28%. Men's comps were down by a low twenty; women's comps were down by a low thirty. Transactions per average store decreased 35%; average transaction value increased 6%.
Across all brands, average unit retail decreased 6%. We believe July sales were somewhat adversely affected by a shift in timing of tax free holidays and later back to school dates in certain parts of the country.
From a merchandise classification standpoint across all brands and both men's and women's, graphic tees, shorts and knit tops were weakest. Female woven shirts and dresses continued to be stronger performing categories.
 
Regionally, comparable store sales were down in all US regions and Canada. Comparable store sales continued to be strongly positive in the London flagship store.
The Company will release its second quarter results on Friday, August 14, 2009, prior to the open of the market, followed by a conference call at 8:30 AM Eastern Time.
