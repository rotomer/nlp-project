Exhibit 99.1
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) today reported unaudited second quarter results which reflected a net loss of $26.7 million and a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.30 for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2009, compared to net income of $77.8 million and net income per diluted share of $0.87 for the thirteen weeks ended August 2, 2008.
New Albany, Ohio, August 14, 2009:
The unaudited results also reflect a loss before income taxes of $19.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2009, which includes pre-tax charges of $24.4 million associated with the closure of Ruehl operations and related store asset impairment charges as further described below.
Second Quarter Sales Highlights
Mike Jeffries, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said:
"We continued to be confronted with very challenging conditions during the second quarter. We believe we are doing the right things to address those challenges and improve our domestic business. In the meantime, we remain very encouraged by our prospects for international growth."
Second Quarter 2009 Financial Results
Net sales for the thirteen weeks ended August 1, 2009 decreased 23% to $648.5 million from $845.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended August 2, 2008. Total Company direct-to-consumer net sales decreased 13% to $48.7 million for the thirteen week period ended August 1, 2009, compared to the thirteen week period ended August 2, 2008. Total Company second quarter comparable store sales decreased 30%.
The gross profit rate for the quarter was 66.5%, 360 basis points lower than last year's second quarter gross profit rate. The decrease in gross profit rate was primarily attributable to a higher markdown rate for the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year.
Stores and distribution expense, as a percentage of sales, increased to 56.6% from 42.6%. Although the Company was able to achieve savings in store payroll, direct-to-consumer and other variable expenses, the reduction in those expenses was less than the rate of the sales decline and not
 
enough to offset increases in rent, depreciation and other occupancy costs, as well as $23.0 million of net lease termination related costs associated with the exit of Ruehl. Stores and distribution expense for the second quarter also included Ruehl store asset impairment charges of $0.8 million.
Marketing, general and administrative expense for the second quarter was $88.7 million compared to $109.0 million during the same period last year. The reduction in marketing, general and administrative expense includes savings related to employee compensation and benefits, travel, outside services and marketing. Marketing, general and administrative expense for the quarter included $0.6 million of severance charges associated with the exit of Ruehl.
Operating loss for the second quarter was $21.5 million, inclusive of $23.6 million pre-tax charges associated with the exit of Ruehl and $0.8 million related store asset impairment charges.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $1.8 million, flat compared to the same period last year.
Loss before income taxes for the second quarter was $19.8 million, inclusive of $24.4 million pre-tax charges associated with the exit of Ruehl and related store asset impairment charges.
Income tax expense for the second quarter was $7.0 million, which was comprised of $11.5 million of expense related to a true-up of the first quarter income tax provision and $4.5 million of benefit associated with the second quarter loss before income taxes. The income tax true-up, as calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 18, "Accounting for Taxes in Interim Periods," was the result of a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax rate as determined in the second quarter. The lower projected rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of projected income before income taxes coming from international operations with a lower overall effective rate, and a lower proportion of projected income before income taxes coming from domestic operations, partially resulting from the second quarter charges associated with the closure of Ruehl.
The Company ended the second quarter with $366.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, and outstanding debt and letters of credit of $79.6 million. During the quarter, the Company repaid US dollar denominated borrowings of $100 million outstanding under the credit agreement and, separately, drew down approximately $37 million in foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund international lease and capital expenditure commitments.
Ruehl Update
As previously announced, on June 16, 2009 the Board of Directors approved the closure of the Company's 29 Ruehl branded stores and related direct-to-consumer operations. The Company anticipates the closure will be substantially complete by the end of the current fiscal year.
The Company continues to expect that it will incur aggregate incremental net pre-tax charges to exit Ruehl of approximately $65 million, of which the Company incurred $23.6 million in the second quarter. The estimate of total charges is based on a number of significant assumptions and could change materially. The remaining charges are expected to be substantially recognized during the remaining two quarters of Fiscal 2009 in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In addition to the $23.6 million exit costs, the Company incurred store asset impairment charges related to Ruehl of $50.7 million and $0.8 million in the first and second quarters of Fiscal 2009, respectively.
The unaudited results for the quarter also include the operating results for Ruehl as summarized in the table accompanying the financial statements included with this release.
 
Other Developments
During the quarter, the Company opened the first Epic Hollister flagship store, in New York, as well as two Hollister mall-based stores in the United Kingdom and one domestic abercrombie store.
The Company remains on track to open three international flagship stores in Fiscal 2009 including Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie in Milan and Abercrombie & Fitch in Tokyo.
Internationally, the Company remains on track to open ten mall-based stores in Fiscal 2009, including one abercrombie store in Canada and seven Hollister stores in the United Kingdom. The Company also expects to open one Hollister mall-based store in Germany and one in Italy.
Domestically, the Company plans to open nine mall-based stores in Fiscal 2009, including two abercrombie stores, four Hollister stores, one Gilly Hicks store and two outlet stores.
The Company now expects total capital expenditures for Fiscal 2009 to be approximately $185 million, including approximately $140 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels, and approximately $45 million related to information technology, distribution center and other home office projects. The reduction in capital expenditures from the previously announced estimate of $200 million is primarily a result of lower than expected construction costs related to Fiscal 2009 store openings as well as the reduction and postponement of non-essential projects related to existing stores.
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per share on the Class A Common Stock of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. payable on September 15, 2009 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 28, 2009.
At quarter end, the Company operated 350 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 210 abercrombie stores, 510 Hollister Co. stores, 29 RUEHL stores and 16 Gilly Hicks stores in the United States. The Company also operated three Abercrombie & Fitch stores, three abercrombie stores and five Hollister Co. stores in Canada, and one Abercrombie & Fitch store and five Hollister Co. stores in the United Kingdom. The Company operates e-commerce websites at www.abercrombie.com, www.abercrombiekids.com, www.hollisterco.com, www.RUEHL.com and www.gillyhicks.com.

PRESENTATION
 
Operator
Good day, everyone and welcome to the Abercrombie and Fitch second quarter earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). We will open the call to take your questions at the end of the presentation. And we ask that you limit yourselves to one question during the question-and-answer session.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Eric Cerny. Mr. Cerny, please go ahead, sir.
 
Eric Cerny
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Manager  IR
Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter sales and earnings, balance sheet, statement of operations, and an updated financial history. Please feel free to reference these materials, available on our website. This call is being recorded and the replay may be accessed through the Internet at Abercrombie.com. Before we begin, I remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to the Safe Harbor statement found in our SEC filings.
Today's earnings call will be limited to one hour. We will begin the call with a few brief remarks from Mike, followed by a review of the financial performance for the quarter from Jonathan Ramsden and Brian Logan. After our prepared comments, we will be available to take your questions for as long as time permits. Please limit yourself to one question so we can speak with as many callers as possible. Now to Mike.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We continue to be confronted with very challenging conditions during the second quarter. We believe we are doing the right things to address those challenges and improve our domestic business. In the meantime, we remain very encouraged by our prospects for international growth.
As a company that stands for optimism, confidence, and aspiration, we sell the best of America, and we think that the world has a growing appreciation of these values. However, consumer spending patterns domestically continue to be dictated by cost and value propositions, and this is clearly a headwind for our premium brands. We find ourselves working to affect the things that are within our control, and remain confident that we will be better positioned as a result of our actions to take advantage of the eventual turnaround.
Jonathan and Brian will provide more detail on our financial results in a moment, but I would like to share with you some of the key points regarding our strategy as well as some of the things we are seeing today that allow us to look to the future with optimism. First, as many of you have heard me say before, our future is tied to the international expansion of our brands. We increasingly see this opportunity, which will drive the future growth and profitability of our business, pointing in a positive direction.

Aug. 14. 2009 / 8:30AM ET, ANF  Q2 2009 Abercrombie & Fitch Co. Earnings Conference Call
Our performance in the UK proves that there's a strong demand for our brands overseas. The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship in London, having opened its doors 2.5 years ago continues to comp significantly positively. We currently have five Hollister mall-based stores in the UK, and are extremely pleased with the reception the brand has received as we have opened each location. We are clearly offering the international customer a shopping experience unlike anything they currently have.
Second, we feel very good about the progress we have made on our product offering. We are always pushing ourselves to offer classic casual trend right exceptional quality product, but have admittedly missed some of the fashion opportunities that drove the business in the spring. We feel like we have corrected those fashion misses and have been increasingly adding fashion elements to the assortment throughout the quarter in preparation for back-to-school and Christmas shopping, particularly for the female business. We've heard the reaction from many of you as well as our store associates and our customers. You like the newness and the variety we have added to our assortments.
Third, as I mentioned to you last quarter, we recognize price is an important component of our business model. We are planning to deliver greater reductions in AUR for the fall season, but we'll continue to review pricing on an ongoing basis. For the back-to-school and Christmas shopping periods, you will continue to see us offer a balance of full-priced fashion product and specialty priced product throughout the store. Spring 2010 we are sourcing into lower product costs to help support lower AURs. Most importantly, we will do this while protecting quality.
Lastly, it was great to see so many of you at the epic Hollister opening in Soho in July. For those of you not able to make it, I encourage you to pay a visit to the store. We believe it is truly a unique experience and expect it to be a tourist destination for the Hollister customer and to support our international Hollister rollout. With that, I will hand the call over to Jonathan, but will be available to answer your questions at the end of our comments.
 
Jonathan Ramsden
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  EVP, CFO
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter the company's net sales decreased 23% to $648.5 million, our comp sales decreased 30%. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 66.5%, down 360 basis points, approximately in line with the first quarter gross margin reduction. Again, reflecting our higher markdown rate for the quarter. For the full season, we anticipate further gross margin erosion compared to last year, although we expect the rate of erosion to moderate compared to the first half of the year.
Our operating loss for the quarter was $21.5 million. This included pretax charges of $24.4 million associated with the closure of RUEHL and an operating loss from continued RUEHL store and DTC operations of $6 million. The impact of RUEHL operations is summarized in an attachment to this morning's earnings release.
During the quarter, we continued to make progress on operating expenses. Marketing, general, and administrative expense for the second quarter was $88.7 million, down 19% versus last year's expense of $109 million. The reduction in MG&A includes savings related to employee compensation and benefits, travel, outside services, and marketing. MG&A for the quarter also included $0.6 million of severance charges associated with the exit of RUEHL. For the balance of the year we anticipate the percentage reduction at MG&A will moderate to a single-digit figure as we anniversary 2008 savings and potentially restore a portion of incentive and related comp accrual.
Stores and distribution expense of $367.2 million for the quarter included $23.8 million of RUEHL exit and store asset impairment charges. Excluding those charges, store occupancy costs accounted for 24.9% of sales and for approximately 730 basis points of operating margin de- leverage relative to the prior year. Reversal of this de-leveraging effect over time will depend in part on an increase in domestic store productivity levels. In addition, we will benefit from the opening of international stores for which we've been paying significant pre opening rent during 2009. Beyond that, we are in the process of reviewing our domestic store base. We currently have approximately 270 leases expiring between now and the end of fiscal year 2011, and a disproportionate number of our currently underperforming stores have leases expiring during this period.
Prior to the effect of RUEHL exit charges, we expect store occupancy costs to continue to increase modestly in dollar terms over the balance of the year as a result of new stores. All other stores and distribution expenses comprising selling, payroll, store management, support, distribution, DTC and other costs, represented 28% of sales and were down approximately 14% on a year-over-year basis, and approximately 19% on an average store basis. These reductions were realized despite having to absorb $1.4 million of expense associated with increases in minimum wage rates. During the quarter, we implemented additional cost saving initiatives including a non payroll area such as repairs an maintenance.
Year-over-year de-leveraging effect of all other stores and distribution expenses was 300 basis points for the quarter compared to 440 basis points for the first quarter. We anticipate a minimal level of de-leveraging for the balance of the year. As an update to our specific plans for new store openings in 2009, domestically, in addition to the Hollister epic flag ship store in Soho that opened in July, we now expect to open nine stores in

2009. This includes two Abercrombie stores, four Hollister stores, one Gilly Hicks store, and two outlet stores. Internationally we remain on track to open Abercrombie & Fitch and Abercrombie flagships in Milan in October, and an Abercrombie & Fitch flagship in Tokyo in December.
We now expect to open seven Hollister mall-based stores in the UK, one Hollister mall-based store in Frankfurt, Germany, one Hollister mall-based store in Rome, and one kids store in Canada. To provide some color on our international results, our year to date international store sales have been around $90 million at productivity levels in excess of our average domestic stores. Our Hollister store at White City in London is our single most productive Hollister store on a per square foot basis.
Fiscal 2009 total capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $185 million, including approximately $140 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels, and approximately $45 million related to IT distribution center and other home office projects. The reduction in capital expenditures from the previously announced estimate of $200 million is primarily a result of net reductions in construction costs related to 2009 store openings, timing effects related to 2010 store openings, and the reduction and postponement of nonessential capital projects related to existing stores. We continue to expect an accelerated rate of openings for international mall-based Hollister stores in 2010 and 2011.
Now to Brian, who will provide some additional detail on our first quarter financial performance.
 
Brian Logan
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  VP, Finance
Thank you, Jonathan. As reported, fiscal 2009 second quarter net sales for the 13 weeks ended August 1st, 2009, decreased 23% to $648.5 million from $845.8 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2nd, 2008. Second quarter direct to consumer net sales decreased 13% to $48.7 million.
Total company comparable store sales decreased 30%. Average transactions per store decreased 22%. Average transaction value decreased 8%, and average unit retail decreased 5% for the quarter.
Across all brands, the masculine categories continued to outperform the feminine categories, as male comparable store sales decreased by a low 20%, while female comparable store sales decreased by a mid-30%. From a merchandise classification standpoint, on a total company basis for both male and female, knit tops, graphic tees and shorts were the weakest performer, while female, wovens, and dresses performed stronger. For the second quarter, the gross profit rate was 66.5%, down 360 basis points from last year's second quarter rate of 70.1%, reflecting a higher markdown rate.
We ended the second quarter with inventory per gross square foot at cost down 35%. Stores and distribution expense for the quarter as a percentage of sales increased 14 percentage points to 56.6% versus 42.6% last year. Stores and distribution expense included $23 million of lease termination related costs associated with the exit of RUEHL and $0.8 million of RUEHL store asset impairment charges.
For the second quarter, marketing, general, and administrative expense was $88.7 million, down 19% versus last year's expense of $109 million. As a percentage of sales, MG&A expense increased 80 basis points to 13.7% from 12.9% last year. MG&A expense for the quarter included $0.6 million of severance charges associated with the exit of RUEHL.
Income tax expense for the second quarter was $7 million, which was comprised of $11.5 million of expense related to a true-up of the first quarter income tax provision and $4.5 million of benefit associated with the second quarter loss before income taxes. The income tax true-up, as calculated in accordance with FIN 18, was a result of a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax rate as determined in the second quarter. The lower projected rate is primarily due to a higher proportion of projected income before income taxes, coming from international operations with a lower overall effective tax rate, and a lower proportion of projected income before income taxes coming from domestic operations, partially resulting from the second quarter charges associated with the closure of RUEHL.
The effective tax rate for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 could be impacted by a number of factors, including the recognition of additional RUEHL charges related to the exit of RUEHL. For the fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to return to historic levels.
For the second quarter, we reported a net loss of $26.7 million, and a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.30 compared to net income of $77.8 million, and net income per diluted share of $0.87 last year. The second quarter net loss and net loss per diluted and basic share, included pretax charges of $24.4 million associated with the exit of RUEHL and related RUEHL store asset impairment charges, and $11.5 million of expense related to a true-up of the first quarter income tax provision.

We ended the second quarter with $366.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, and outstanding debt and letters of credit of $79.6 million. During the quarter we repaid the US dollar denominated borrowings of $100 million outstanding at the beginning of the quarter under the credit agreement and separately, we drew down approximately $37 million in foreign currency denominated borrowings used to fund international lease and capital expenditure commitments. Also during the second quarter, certain auction-rate securities with a fair value of $59.7 million and for which the company has a right to exercise a put option at par commencing in June 2010 were reclassified from non current marketable securities to current marketable securities. The put option with the fair value of $16.3 million, was also reclassified from other assets to other current assets.
During the second quarter, we opened six new stores, resulting in a 1% growth in square footage from the end of the first quarter of 2009. We ended the second quarter with a total of 354 Abercrombie & Fitch, 213 Abercrombie, 520 Hollister, 29 RUEHL, and 16 Gilly Hicks stores, including three Abercrombie & Fitch, three Abercrombie, and five Hollister stores in Canada, and one Abercrombie & Fitch and five Hollister stores in the United Kingdom.
This concludes our prepared comments section of the call. We are now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question so that we can speak to as many callers as possible. After everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
 
Operator
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, our question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). We will pause for just a moment to assemble the question roster. And for our first question we go to Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs.
 
Michelle Tan
 Goldman Sachs  Analyst
Great, thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on the incremental cost savings, the occupancy came in a little lower than I think you had expected, and also the decline in non occupancy was a decent amount better than last quarter, so just wondering if you could help us understand where those came from and then how sustainable that is through the rest of the year.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Hey, Michelle. How are you?
 
Michelle Tan
 Goldman Sachs  Analyst
Good, how are you?
 
Jonathan Ramsden
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  EVP, CFO
G thanks. Yeah, I guess in terms of the occupancy, I think what we said on the last call was in that dollar terms it was going to be pretty much in line with the first quarter, and we were pretty close to that. There wasn't a significant change there. On the other stores and distribution expenses, we were able to make progress, particularly  we mentioned a couple minutes ago the repairs and maintenance expense area. That was a fairly significant reduction that we hadn't anticipated at the time of the last call but on which we were able to make some good progress during the quarter, then there were a number of other less significant individual components, but that repairs and maintenance piece was the biggest single component.
 
Operator
And for our next question we go to Christine Chen with Needham & Company.

The answer to that is yes. This is the third time we've done it. We started the first time last Christmas, and we see that it works, but it is really just a part of a total denim strategy. I feel very happy with our denim assortments for back-to-school. I think we're in the right silhouettes. I think our washes continue to be beautiful. I think we dominate in the destroyed category, which is very trend right, and price is a factor in the whole equation. Clearly denim is a very competitive category for back to school. We're happy with how we're positioned, and we'll see how the other season works out, but thank you.

Janet Kloppenburg

Mike, I was wondering if could you spend a few minutes talking to us about what's happening in the basics business and the fashion business. It seems that the basic business has been where the greatest resistance has been. Maybe you could talk about how you remedy that, and also talk a little bit about the trend or the response to the much better fashion product that you now have at both Hollister and Abercrombie & Fitch. Thanks so much.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Great question. It's clear that the basic categories are and have been troubled, and the most susceptible to price. So our solution has been that the basic categories are the ones that we offer at the most compelling prices. We continue to see and believe that customers will pay for the right fashion. And that's exactly what's happening in the business. You've seen, customers have seen, many of you out there have commented about the improved fashion content in the A&F and the Hollister stores, and we're very pleased with the direction it's going. We continue to be excited about the plaid statement, and it's clearly resonating with the customer. The story will continue to be about newness, more fashion, continuous flows throughout the fall season, and the fashion content of our inventory is much improved. It's a work in progress.

Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Hi, Jeff.
 
Jeff Klinefelter
 Piper Jaffray  Analyst
Jonathan, maybe you can frame up this again, recap. On the international side with all the pre opening expenses you have been incurring, remind us what you're incurring from those, and also any other corporate related expenses that you do direct toward international, and then how that's going to be offset by these store openings this year, how much of that will continue next year with really, I guess, just Paris on deck, and I just wanted to clarify something, tell me again the occupancy de-leveraging versus the store expense de-leveraging domestically? Thank you.
 
Jonathan Ramsden
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  EVP, CFO
Brian will give you the pre opening rent figures in a second. Let me give you the de-leveraging effects again. I guess what we're saying for the all other stores and distribution expenses, excluding store occupancy, de-leveraging effect fork the balance of the year will be minimal. I'm just digging out the numbers here. For the second quarter, it was 300 basis points for those expenses versus 440 for the first quarter, and we see that going to a minimal level of de-leveraging for the balance of the year. Store occupancy was a 730-basis-points de-leveraging in Q2. In dollar terms on store occupancy we see that rising modestly over the remaining two quarters of the year.
 
Brian Logan
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  VP, Finance
Jeff this is Brian. The pre opening rent, incremental pre opening rent in the second quarter of this year over second quarter of last year was about $1 million. We are starting to see that incremental impact come down. In the first quarter it was roughly $3.5 to $4 million. It's come down to $1 million in the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we aren't anticipating a meaningful impact on an incremental basis, largely because we're starting to anniversary some of the pre opening rent we had to take last year for the flagships and also a lot of the domestic new store construction is down in the second half of the year versus the second half of last year. So on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of the year, we don't anticipate much of an incremental benefit or expense associated with pre opening rent.

Similar to the improvements you've infused in the fashion product, do you think there's opportunity to improve the basic styles more meaningfully as well?
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
I think that's a good question, and the answer is absolutely yes. It is an era of more meaningful decoration is a way to put it, and we're working very hard on that. So in answer, a little more color on Janet's question, basics, we're reducing the percentage in the inventory that is basic. That is basic is being priced more aggressively, and we are working on updating them. It's a combination of the three. But that's a good question. Thanks, Linda.

Jonathan Ramsden

Hi, Paul. I think on the first part of the question, we don't have a specific number at this point. We're going to take the balance of this year to continue to dig into that and think about what we think the optimal footprint size should be going forward, and obviously in part that's going to be a function of what level of recovery we anticipate over time domestically. So we aren't entirely through that. I think we do believe that if there is a contraction it would be more into towards the A & F brand than the other brands.

If it not, if you see growth here in the United States, which brand or brands would you expect to continue to be able to grow, and on a net basis do you expect to contract, for example, the Abercrombie & Fitch brand? Thanks.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
I think the answer to that is yes. We think we're mature in the United States in all of the brands, with the exception of Gilly. There would be slight contraction in the Hollister brand and the contraction that will occur will be in the Abercrombie & Fitch and kids brands domestically.

Adrienne Tennant
 FBR Capital Markets  Analyst
Good morning, everyone. My questions for you. What has been the learnings in May, you kind of started promoting a little bit more, driving a little bit more through some of the clearance activity. Historically, it seems that Abercrombie has used clearance or markdowns to clear goods as opposed to drive traffic. And so what learnings have you had and what's kind of the go-forward strategy on promotions and clearance?
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
The learning is that we're in very tough economic times where price has become more of an object for us than it ever has been, and we're using this strategy to drive traffic during this time. It is not the primary vehicle, nor it will be the primary vehicle for driving business. But it is part of the balance at this point. I would certainly hope that the future we would use and  use less and wean ourselves of this vehicle. But it is not the driving force of this business. The driving force is fashion, quality, aspiration, and will continue to be so. And I think you see the stores and how we're treating it. That's exactly how it appears to our customer.

Hi, Liz.
 
Liz Dunn
 Thomas Weisel Partners  Analyst
I guess my question relates to pricing. We've heard from some suppliers that the pricing strategy will be sort of more of a tiered structure. Is your thinking that if you do layer on a tiered pricing structure, that you can sort of flex that as the economy improves and pull back on some of the lower price stuff and increase the higher price stuff, or what's kind of your thinking there, and how do you communicate this pricing strategy to consumers, because I think one concept we've talked about in the past is that they seem to be sort of boycotting higher priced brands. Thanks.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Well, we do have a tiered pricing strategy. It has  I'm stumbling with the answer because we continue to audit the results on a weekly basis. We kind of do more of what works and less of what doesn't. The future is that we will have a tiered pricing strategy. The issue that's been raised is whether we're going to be offering them at clearance prices or ticket prices. And the answer to that is that ticket prices will become a bigger and bigger part of our assortment. I think that might be what you're getting at. But thanks for the question.

Good morning, everyone. Hi. Can you talk a little bit on the international business? Learnings from Hollister, learnings from Abercrombie international, how is it different from the US and how is what you've learned at Abercrombie in in forming Hollister, what's different than you may have expected in helping you go forward.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Great question. The key to our international business is that we run at the same as we do the domestic business. You cannot tell the difference between being in London, New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco. And the interesting thing about it, Dana, is that we sell the same things and the same depths virtually everywhere. There's some slight variations.
But what we're selling is the American lifestyle and everything that it represents. So casual, energetic, young product resonates with people in London, now the UK, we're hoping Italy in store, we're hoping Germany, but we come at that with a great deal of confidence because we see that we're doing business with those people in other stores or through the Internet now. But the issue is really that it's very much the same, and that's how we're approaching the international business. We clearly learned from A & F that that is the case, but we're seeing that that's absolutely the

You've mentioned that kids and Hollister sees the most impact, but anything you can give us, sort of a blended AUR change and how your strategy is set up there.
 
Mike Jeffries

I can tell you that it will continue to be most dramatic in kids and Hollister, that the AUR decrease will be greater in third quarter than it's been in second. And that's about the extent of the color that I can offer. But you're exactly right, the key is lowering the average unit cost, which we will do and are doing for third, fourth, first, and second quarters. Thanks. Jonathan.
 
Jonathan Ramsden

Good.
 
Stacy Pak
 SP Research  Analyst
Question for you on just the domestic flagships, Mike. Can you comment on the success of the epic Hollister and to date, should we sort of assume that you're  we should assume the same kind of success level per foot as a Fifth Avenue, and then with regard to the kids flagship, how do you think about cannibalization of Fifth Avenue? And then just your comment earlier about your brands being mature in the US, how do you think about opening flagships now in the US, given you think those brands are mature? Thanks.
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
Okay. Let's start with Epic. We're very pleased with Epic, and we're very pleased on number of fronts. One, it's going to be a major volume store. It will not reach the productivity per foot of Fifth Avenue, and we haven't planned to the do. So beyond that we don't really talk about the figures. But you can see it's a successful store.
Point two is, what Epic has allowed us to do in terms of extending the lifestyle experience, we're going to take many of the things that we're doing in that store and take them to the Hollister chain. In the new stores that we're opening in Europe, which is a very exciting thing.
But the third factor is something that is more subtle and some of you picked up on. Epic offered us the opportunity to extend our assortments and to really, as a company, dig into what is the heart of Hollister, southern California beach culture, the and how do we reflect that in the assortments for the chain, to let us further differentiate Hollister from the other brands. So from all three points of view, we're very thrilled with Epic.
Kids flagship on Fifth Avenue, we're looking at very carefully, and I will be very candid with you, we are looking at maximizing the bottom line in that location. And it's really the bottom line on Fifth Avenue. So cannibalization to kids could be a fact to but we're very committed as a company to making sure that we get the best return on Fifth Avenue. So we might be looking at other options.
The third factor, flagships in the US, we don't see the opportunity for many more flagships in the US. The only opportunity in a flagship is international. So in those locations that would attract international customers, we're interested, but there really aren't any more US flagships on our horizon at all. There are too many opportunities overseas. Good questions.

You've talked in the past about keeping the premium price points and keeping a fairly wide gap between your competitors, now we're talking about obviously in Hollister decreasing that. How far do you think we've come in 3Q and 4Q on the pricing front, and when do you think, given all that's happened, is it permanent? When do you think we're in a better position? Is it spring? Is it next fall? Thanks.

Jeff, if could answer that question, I could move to the White House. I don't know, and I don't think anyone does. We're in an economic situation that's affected consumer confidence, and aspirational better brands have have been hardest hit. Will it turn around? Absolutely.

Jonathan Ramsden

Hi, Richard. We're basically going to take the balance of this year really to look very hard at that. As we get towards the end of the year we'll have some greater degree of visibility than we have today in terms of what we can expect in terms of a recovery. But we're going to look at it market by market. It's going to be a very detailed look at the expirations what we can expect if we were to close a particular store in a market to transfer to other stores, and we're still working through that yet, so I don't think we're in a position to give a whole lot more guidance, but obvious we will assume some level of recovery, since we don't expect the business to flat line its current level on a long-term basis, but that aspect of it, the cost structure aspect, then just going market by market and looking at what we think the optimal footprint is in each market.

Randy Konik
 Jefferies & Co  Analyst
Question for Jonathan. You spoke about gross margin deteriorating but getting less  being less so than the second quarter. With the AURs coming down is that a function of you think the IMU is going to be heading higher, and the markdown rate will go down because of the tight inventory? Going into the fourth quarter, given that you are going to be lapping significant margin reductions from 4Q 2008, is it something that you can see the gross margin starting to flatten out towards the end of the year? Thanks.
 
Jonathan Ramsden
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  EVP, CFO
Hey, Randy. What we're saying is that there will continue to be margin erosion in the fall, but since our prior year full margin was already impacted by additional markdowns we took in the fall season last year, the year-over-year margin erosion for the fall will be less than it's been, we expect, in the first half of the year. The reason it will will continue to be pressured is we are expecting to have to take markdowns as we move towards sourcing into those lower AURs.

And we have a very detailed growth plan for that business that calls for growth by category in terms of volume and margin. I think that the biggest learning curve for that business can be looked at in terms of what we learned from RUEHL. And the biggest learning from RUEHL is that as a company, we don't do mature well.

If we look at some of the Hollister stores, it would seem that you've moved a little bit away from the level of logoing. How do you look upon that, and how aggressive are you going to be with that? And just a clarification, what should we be looking at the tax rate going forward for the second half of this year and for 2010?
 
Mike Jeffries
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Chairman, CEO
That's a good observation. We look to decrease the percentage of logo in all of our brands. We think that's an important concept for sustainability of the brands, and having said that, logo is very important, because it represents the brand, but we are decreasing the percentage of logo in all the brands.
 
Brian Logan
 Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  VP, Finance
Eric, as far as the effective tax rate, we won't be giving guidance for the back half of the year on the effective tax rate because it can be affected by a number of factors, one of which would be any additional RUEHL charges that we may take in the back half of the year. So that could cause the rate to fluctuate in the third and fourth quarter. But for the  in 2010, we would expect that our effective tax rate would return to more of the historic levels that we've seen in the past.
