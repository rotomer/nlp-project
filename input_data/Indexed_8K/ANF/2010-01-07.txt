Exhibit 99.2
This is Eric Cerny, Manager of Investor Relations for Abercrombie & Fitch. The following is a summary of our sales results for the fiscal month ended January 2, 2010.
Before I begin, I remind you that any forward-looking statements I may make are subject to the Safe Harbor Statement found in our SEC filings.
Net sales for the five-week period ended January 2, 2010, were $482.5 million, an 11% decrease from net sales of $539.2 million for the five-week period ended January 3, 2009. Total Company direct-to-consumer net merchandise sales were $44.0 million for the five-week period ended January 2, 2010, a 4% decrease from sales for the five-week period ended January 3, 2009. December comparable store sales decreased 19%.
During fiscal November and December, the Company conducted special events in most of its North American stores and direct-to-consumer channels in which complimentary gift cards, with a January 30, 2010 expiration, were issued to customers who made purchases above defined amounts. The value of these gift cards issued but not redeemed has been deducted from reported sales for the applicable month. The cumulative face value of gift cards issued in connection with these special events, but not yet redeemed as of the end of fiscal December, was approximately $22 million.
 
For returns associated with transactions in which a gift card was issued, the Company's practice to date has been to honor the gift card, even where the return has resulted in an overall transaction value below the threshold amount. The Company believes that the value of gift cards issued where a customer purchased merchandise with the intent to return it and retain the gift card is not significant. The Company will continue to monitor returns closely through the end of the program.
For the month of December, comparable store sales were considerably stronger in week 5 than the weeks leading up to Christmas and this trend has continued into January.
