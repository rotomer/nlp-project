Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
As previously reported, on September 24, 2010, Robert A. Rosholt notified Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the Registrant) that Mr. Rosholt was resigning from the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Registrant. Mr. Rosholt had been a member of the Boards Audit Committee. As a result of Mr. Rosholts resignation, the Registrant received a notice from NYSE Regulation, Inc. on October 5, 2010 stating that the Registrant was deficient in meeting the requirement of Section 303A.07(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Listed Company Manual, which requires that the audit committee of a NYSE listed company be comprised of at least three independent directors. On October 11, 2010, the first meeting held by the Registrants Board after the resignation of Mr. Rosholt, the Registrants Board appointed Craig R. Stapleton as a new member of the Audit Committee to replace Mr. Rosholt, which brought the Registrant into compliance with the requirement of Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Audit Committee has not met since Mr. Rosholts resignation on September 24, 2010 and is not scheduled to meet until November 11, 2010.
Mr. Stapleton also serves as the Registrants Lead Independent Director, Chair of the Boards Nominating and Board Governance Committee and a member of the Boards Compensation Committee.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
