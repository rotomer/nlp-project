Item 8.01. Other Events.
On November 21, 2012, Michael S. Jeffries, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (the Company), entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (the 2013 Plan) with a broker to sell, subject to a limit order, shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value (the Common Stock), that will be acquired upon the exercise of certain of Mr. Jeffries's employee stock options which, if not exercised, would expire within a year, and certain stock-settled stock appreciation rights. Mr. Jeffries entered into the 2013 Plan for investment diversification.
Assuming the conditions of the limit order are met, Mr. Jeffries currently intends to sell up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2013 Plan during the period beginning on February 23, 2013 and ending on January 31, 2014, at which time the 2013 Plan will terminate. Mr. Jeffries will report transactions effected under the 2013 Plan through Rule 144 and Form 4 filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as appropriate. Of the 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock subject to the 2013 Plan, 782,525 shares will roll over from a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan entered into by Mr. Jeffries on March 21, 2012, which terminates on January 31, 2013 (the 2012 Plan), unless some or all of such shares are sold pursuant to the 2012 Plan, in which case the number of shares subject to the 2013 Plan will be reduced by an equivalent amount.
The 2013 Plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with the Company's Policy Statement Regarding Trading in Company Securities and Compliance with Federal Securities Laws
