(ii)

(ii)

Vested benefits and other amounts that the Key Manager is otherwise entitled to receive under any other plan, policy, practice, or program of the Company or any of its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program (subject to the Company's right to amend such terms), as the case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Employment Agreement.
6.
                                      
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
 
  The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in, and otherwise to perform its obligation under, this Employment Agreement shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action that the Company may have against the Key Manager or others.  In no event shall the Key Manager be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Key Manager under any of the provisions of this Employment Agreement and the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Employment Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Key Manager as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by the Key Manager to the Company or otherwise.

Full Settlement
 
8.
                                      
Confidential Information
 
The Key Manager shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company and its affiliates all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliated companies and their respective businesses that the Key Manager obtains during the Key Manager's
(a)
                                 
employment by the Company or any of its affiliated companies and that is not public knowledge (other than as a result of the Key Manager's violation of this Section 8) ("Confidential Information").  The Key Manager shall not communicate, divulge, or disseminate Confidential Information at any time during or after the Key Manager's employment with the Company, except with the prior written consent of the Company or as otherwise required by law or legal process.  In no event shall any asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 8 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Key Manager under this Employment Agreement.
 
The Key Manager acknowledges that if the Key Manager shall breach or threaten to breach paragraph (a) of this Section 8, the damages to the Company and its affiliates may be substantial, although difficult to ascertain, and money damages will not afford the Company and its affiliates an adequate remedy.  Therefore, if the paragraph (a) of the Section 8 is violated, in whole or in part, the Company and its affiliates shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief, without prejudice to other remedies the Company and/or its affiliates may have at law or in equity.
(b)
                                
 
9.    Key Manager acknowledges and recognizes the highly competitive nature of the businesses of the Company and its affiliates and accordingly, as partial consideration for the Company entering into this Employment Agreement, agrees as follows:
Non-Competition
 
(a)  During the Employment Period, if the Key Manager ceases to be employed by the Company for any reason, other than due to Company's failure to renew the Employment Period pursuant to Section 1, the Key Manager will not, whether on Key Manager's own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any person, firm, partnership, joint venture association, corporation or other business organization, entity or enterprise whatsoever ("Person"), directly or indirectly solicit or assist in soliciting in competition with the Company, the business of any customer of the Company or prospective customer of the Company:
 
(i)  with whom Key Manager had personal contact or dealings on behalf of the Company during the two year period preceding Key Manager's termination of employment;
 
(ii)  with whom employees reporting to Key Manager have had personal contact or dealings on behalf of the Company during the two year immediately preceding Key Manager's termination of employment; or
(iii)  for whom Key Manager had direct or indirect responsibility during the two year immediately preceding Key Manager's terminate of employment.
 
(b)  During the Employment Period, Key Manager will not directly or indirectly:
 
(i)  engage in any coal-related business that competes with the business of the Company or its affiliates (including, without limitation, businesses which the Company or its affiliates have specific plans to conduct in the future and as to which Key Manager is aware of such planning) in the United States (a "Competitive Business");
 
(ii)  enter the employ of, or render any services to, any Person (or any division or controlled or controlling affiliate of any Person) who or which engages in a Competitive Business;
 
(iii)  acquire a financial interest in, or otherwise become actively involved with, any Competitive Business, directly or indirectly, as an individual, partner, shareholder, officer, director, principal, agent, trustee or consultant; or
 
(iv)  interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, business relationships (whether formed before, on or after the date of the Agreement) between the Company or any of its affiliates and customers, clients, suppliers' partners, members or investors of the Company or its affiliates.
 
(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Employment Agreement, Key Manager may, directly or indirectly own, solely as an investment, securities of any Person engaged in the business of the Company or affiliates which are publicly traded on a national or regional stock exchange or on the over-the-counter market if Key Manager (i) is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and (ii) does not, directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such Person.
 
(d)  During the Employment Period or for one (1) year following any Date of Termination, if the Key Manager ceases to be employed by the Company, Key Manager will not, whether on Key Manager's own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Persons, directly or indirectly:
 
(i)  solicit or encourage any employee of the Company or its affiliates to leave the employment of the Company or its affiliates; or
(ii)  hire any such employee who was employed by the Company or its affiliates as of the date of Key Manager's termination of employment with the Company or who left the employment of the Company or its affiliates coincident with, or within one year prior to or after, the termination of Key Manager's employment with the Company.
 
(e)  During the Employment Period or for one (1) year following any Date of Termination, Key Manager will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or encourage to cease to work with the Company or its affiliates any consultant then under contract with the company or its affiliates.
 
(f)  It is expressly understood and agreed that although Key Manager and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this Section 9 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable restriction against Key Manager, the provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable.  Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.
 
10.
                                
Successors
 
This Employment Agreement is personal to the Key Manager and, without the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the Key Manager otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  This Employment Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Key Manager's legal representatives.  If the Key Manager shall die while any amount would still be payable to the Key Manager hereunder had the Key Manager continued to live (other than amounts which by their terms, terminate upon the death of the Key Manager), then all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Employment Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of the Key Manager's estate.
(a)
                                 
 
This Employment Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.
(b)
                                
The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company expressly to assume and agree to perform this Employment Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.  Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effective date of any such succession shall be a breach of this Employment Agreement and shall entitle the Key Manager to compensation from the Company as if the he were terminated without cause.  For purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be treated as the Date of Termination and shall entitle the Key Manager to compensation from the Company.  As used in this Employment Agreement, "Company" shall mean both the Company as defined above and any such successor that assumes and agrees to perform this Employment Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise.
(c)
