Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
 
On December 13, 2005, Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. ("Foundation") notified the New York Stock Exchange that it inadvertently omitted to state in the proxy statement for the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders that its compensation committee charter and its corporate governance guidelines are available on its website and that the information is available in print to any shareholder who requests as required by Sections 303A.05 and 303A.09 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
 
Foundation does not believe that any of the items listed above are material. Each of these documents were published on Foundation's website shortly after its initial public offering in December 2004 and Foundation will make the required statements in its proxy statement for the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  The address for Foundation's website is: www.foundationcoal.com/investors/governance/governance.cfm.  Foundation has corrected such noncompliance by filing this Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: December 14, 2005
