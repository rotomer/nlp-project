The lease has a minimum term of 20 years and for so long thereafter as coal is produced in commercial quantities from the leased lands, subject to readjustment of lease terms at the end of the twentieth lease year and each 10-year period thereafter.
Foundation is obligated to make five (5) deferred bonus payments of $36.108 million each. The first payment was made on the date the bid was awarded by the BLM, and successive payments are due each year on the anniversary date of the lease for 4 years beginning in 2009. Production royalties required under the lease will be 12.5% of the value of the coal produced.
A copy of the coal lease will be filed as an exhibit to Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc.'s Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.
