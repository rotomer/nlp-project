For Immediate Release
May 28, 2008
LINTHICUM HEIGHTS, Md.Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FCL) today announced that the Emerald Mine operated by its affiliate, Emerald Coal Resources, LP, continues to produce at a reduced level following the roof fall announced on May 15, 2008. Through Tuesday, May 27, 2008, production had been impacted by approximately 175,000 tons. The continuous miner development sections have continued production at normal levels, and the longwall has continued to advance, though at a substantially slower than normal rate. Until full production is resumed, the existing force majeure remains in effect.
Kurt Kost, President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "We are extremely proud of our employees who have worked creatively and safely throughout this process to improve roof stability going forward despite the adverse geologic conditions. We will provide additional information once normal longwall operation is resumed, which is expected to occur in the near future. Based on the information currently available, we anticipate that shipments from our affiliates' mines in Northern Appalachia will be approximately 14 million tons for the full year 2008."

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements relating to the future prospects, developments, business strategies, analyses and other information that is based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable are forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) which can be identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. The company has used the words "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made based on expectations and beliefs concerning future events affecting the company and are subject to uncertainties and factors relating to the company's operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the company's control, that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: market demand for coal, electricity and steel; weather conditions or catastrophic weather-related damage; the company's production capabilities; timing of reductions or increases in customer coal inventories; long-term coal supply arrangements; environmental laws, including those directly affecting the company's coal mining and production, and those affecting the company's customers' coal usage; regulatory and court decisions; railroad, barge, trucking and other transportation performance and costs; assumptions concerning economically recoverable coal reserve estimates; employee workforce factors; changes in postretirement benefit and pension obligations; the company's liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. The company advises investors that it discusses additional risk factors and uncertainties that could cause Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. actual results to differ from forward-looking statements in the company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the heading "Risk Factors". The investor should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by the company in this news release or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on which the company makes it. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible for the company to predict these events or how they may affect the company. The company has no duty to, and does not intend to, update or revise the forward-looking statements in this news release after the date of issue, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the investor should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made in this news release or elsewhere might not occur.
