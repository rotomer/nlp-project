The material terms of the 2008 Plan are described in the following paragraphs:
The 2008 Plan is administered by the compensation committee. The 2008 Plan provides performance-based incentive compensation to employees and officers based on their service to Foundation, their performance and other factors with respect to a performance period, which is Foundation's fiscal year. The compensation committee will specify the performance goals applicable to each award. The 2008 Plan has a ten-year term, ending on March 8, 2018. The 2008 Plan is limited to a maximum distribution of a limit of $10 million that may be awarded to any one individual in any one calendar year period. The 2008 Plan may from time to time be amended, suspended or terminated, in whole or in part, by the board of directors or the compensation committee. No amendment of the 2008 Plan that would diminish any of the rights of a participant may be made without the prior written consent of the participant. Additionally, no amendment that requires shareholder approval in order for the 2008 Plan to continue to comply with Code Section 162(m) shall be effective unless the same shall be approved by the requisite vote of the shareholders of the Company.
The 2008 Plan includes the following performance measures: (i) earnings including operating income, earnings before or after taxes, earnings before or after interest, depreciation, amortization, or extraordinary or special items or book value per share (which may exclude nonrecurring items); (ii) pre-tax income or after-tax income; (iii) earnings per common share (basic or diluted); (iv) operating profit; (v) revenue, revenue growth or rate of revenue growth; (vi) return on assets (gross or net), return on investment, return on capital, or return on equity; (vii) returns on sales or revenues; (viii) operating expenses; (ix) stock price appreciation; (x) cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow return on investment (discounted or otherwise), net cash provided by operations, or cash flow in excess of cost of capital; (xi) implementation or completion of critical projects or processes; (xii) economic value created; (xiii) cumulative earnings per share growth; (xiv) operating margin, profit margin, production or earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation margin; (xv) safety performance; (xvi) common stock price or total stockholder return; (xvii) cost targets, reductions and savings, productivity and efficiencies; (xviii) strategic business criteria, consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified market penetration, geographic business expansion, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, human resources management, supervision of litigation, information technology, and goals relating to acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and similar transactions, and budget comparisons; (xix) personal professional objectives, including any of the foregoing performance goals, the implementation of policies and plans, the negotiation of transactions, the development of long-term business goals, formation of joint ventures, research or development collaborations, and the completion of other corporate transactions; and (xx) any combination of, or a specified increase in, any of the foregoing.
The 2008 Plan is designed to ensure that awards under the plan will not be subject to adverse tax consequences applicable to deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
The material terms of the 2004 plan are described in the following paragraphs:
Prior to our initial public offering, the board of directors and stockholders approved the adoption of the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan on August 10, 2004 and September 9, 2004, respectively. The 2004 Plan was described in our initial public offering prospectus dated December 8, 2004. The 2004 Plan was previously amended for an immaterial administrative matter on December 14, 2006. The 2004 Plan has a ten-year term, ending on August 10, 2014. Option repricing is not permitted under the 2004 Plan. Foundation has not increased the shares available under the 2004 Plan since it was originally adopted.
 
Table of Contents
The 2004 Plan is administered by the compensation committee. The 2004 Plan may from time to time be amended or terminated, in whole or in part, by the board of directors or the compensation committee. No amendment or termination of the 2004 Plan that would diminish any of the rights of a participant may be made without the prior written consent of the participant; however the compensation committee may amend the 2004 Plan to permit the granting of awards to meet the requirements of applicable laws.
Administration.
All employees, consultants, directors, and advisors are eligible to receive awards under the 2004 Plan based on their service to Foundation, their performance and other factors. The compensation committee has the authority to select participants and to determine the amount, type and terms of each award.
Eligibility.
The 2004 Plan is limited to a maximum distribution of 5,978,483 shares of Foundation common stock, with a limit of 200,000 shares that may be granted to any one individual in any one calendar year period. As of February 29, 2008, 3,767,287 shares of Foundation common stock had been awarded under the 2004 Plan, leaving a total of 2,211,196 shares of Foundation common stock available for grants under the 2004 Plan. Foundation has not increased the shares of Foundation common stock available under the 2004 Plan since it was originally adopted.
Shares Available.
Grants Under the 2004 Plan
.
. A stock option represents the right to purchase a share of Foundation common stock at a predetermined exercise price. Stock options granted under the 2004 Plan may be in the form of incentive stock options ("ISOs") or nonqualified stock options, as determined in the discretion of the compensation committee. The option price shall be determined by the compensation committee but in no event shall the option price be less than the fair market value of Foundation common stock on the date of grant. The terms of each stock option, including the number of shares of Foundation common stock, exercise price, vesting period and option duration, will be set forth in an award agreement. In no event will a stock option be exercisable prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant and after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Stock options may be exercised, in whole or in part, by payment in full of the exercise price in cash or in the form of shares of Foundation common stock already owned by the participant or through a broker cashless exercise program.
Stock Options
. A stock appreciation right ("SAR") represents the right to receive a payment, in cash, shares of Foundation common stock, or both (as determined by the compensation committee), equal to the spread value (the excess of the fair market value of Foundation common stock on the date the SAR is exercised over the grant price of the SAR). The grant price of a SAR shall be no less than the fair market value of Foundation common stock on the date of grant. The compensation committee may grant SARs either singly or in combination with other awards under the 2004 Plan.
Stock Appreciation Rights
The compensation committee may grant awards of shares, rights to purchase shares of Foundation common stock, awards of restricted shares of Foundation common stock, awards of phantom stock units and other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the fair market value of Foundation common stock, on such terms and conditions it determines in its discretion. The other stock-based awards may be in addition to other awards under the 2004 Plan.
Other Stock-Based Awards.
In the event of a change in control, as defined in the 2004 Plan, the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for the (i) termination of an award upon the consummation of the change in control, but only if such award has vested and been paid out or the participant has been permitted to exercise the option in full for a period of not less than 30 days prior to the change in control, (ii) acceleration of all or any portion of an award, (iii) payment of an amount (in cash or, in the discretion of the compensation committee, in the form of consideration paid to Foundation stockholders in connection with such change in control) in exchange for the cancellation of an award, which, in the case of options and SARs, shall equal the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of Foundation common stock subject to such options or SARs over the aggregate option price or grant price, and/or (iv) issuance of substitute awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected awards previously granted.
Change In Control.
 
Table of Contents
Any award granted under the 2004 Plan may be conditioned on the attainment of one or more performance goals over a specified performance cycle. If the compensation committee intends that an award made to a "covered employee" (generally the chief executive officer and the four most highly compensated executive officers) will constitute "performance-based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, then the performance goals will be based on one or more of the criteria described above.
Performance-Based Awards.
The following is a brief description of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences, based on current law, of awards under the 2004 Plan.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
.
. The grant of an incentive stock option or a nonqualified stock option would not result in income for the grantee or a deduction for Foundation. The exercise of a nonqualified stock option would result in ordinary income for the grantee and a deduction for Foundation measured by the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the shares of Foundation common stock received at the time of exercise. Income tax withholding would be required. The exercise of an incentive stock option would not result in income for the grantee if the grantee (i) does not dispose of the shares of Foundation common stock within two years after the date of grant or one year after the transfer of shares of Foundation common stock upon exercise and (ii) is an employee of Foundation or a subsidiary of Foundation from the date of grant and through and until three months before the exercise date. If these requirements are met, the basis of the shares upon later disposition would be the option price. Any gain will be taxed to the employee as long-term capital gain and Foundation would not be entitled to a deduction. The excess of the market value on the exercise date over the option price is an item of tax preference, potentially subject to the alternative minimum tax. If the grantee disposes of the shares of Foundation common stock prior to the expiration of either of the holding periods, the grantee would recognize ordinary income and Foundation would be entitled to a deduction equal to the lesser of the fair market value of the shares of Foundation common stock on the exercise date minus the option price or the amount realized on disposition minus the option price. Any gain in excess of the ordinary income portion would be taxable as long-term or short-term capital gain.
Stock Options
. The grant of a SAR would not result in income for the grantee or a deduction for Foundation. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the grantee would recognize ordinary income and Foundation would be entitled to a deduction measured by the fair market value of the shares of Foundation common stock plus any cash received. Income tax withholding would be required.
SARs
. If other awards are in the nature of shares of Foundation common stock (as opposed to phantom stock), such awards generally would be taxable as ordinary income equal to the aggregate fair market value of shares of Foundation common stock when the grant is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. If in the form of phantom stock, the award generally would be taxable as ordinary income equal to the aggregate fair market value when convertible to cash or shares that are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In all events, Foundation would be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the amount included in the grantee's income.
Other Stock-Based Awards
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) places a $1,000,000 annual limit on the deductibility by Foundation of compensation paid to covered employees (as described above). The limit, however, does not apply to "qualified performance-based compensation."
Other Tax Considerations.
State and local tax consequences may in some cases differ from the federal tax consequences.
The foregoing summary of the income tax consequences in respect of the 2004 Plan is for general information only. Interested parties should consult their own advisors as to specific tax consequences, including the application and effect of foreign, state and local tax laws.

The total number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan is 5,978,483. The Shares may consist, in whole or in part, of unissued Shares or treasury Shares. The aggregate number of Shares made subject to Awards granted during any fiscal year to any single individual shall not exceed 200,000. Determinations made in respect of the limitation set forth in the preceding sentence shall be made in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code. The issuance of Shares or the payment of cash to a Participant upon the exercise of an Award shall reduce the total number of Shares available under the Plan, as applicable. Shares which are subject to Awards which terminate or lapse may be granted again under the Plan.
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which may delegate its duties and powers in whole or in part as it determines; , , that the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, take any action designated to the Committee under this Plan as it may deem necessary. In no event shall the Committee modify the distribution terms in any Award or Award Agreement that has a feature for the deferral of compensation if such modification would result in taxes, additional interest and/or penalties pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be made under the Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding Awards previously granted by the Company or its Affiliates or a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines. The number of Shares underlying such substitute awards shall be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. The Committee is authorized to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan in the manner and to the extent the Committee deems necessary or desirable. Any decision of the Committee in the interpretation and administration of the Plan, as described herein, shall lie within its sole and absolute discretion and shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned (including, but not limited to, Participants and their beneficiaries or successors). The Committee shall have the full power and authority to establish the terms and conditions of any Award, including the Performance Goals (which shall be determined no later than such time as is required to ensure that an underlying Award which is intended to comply with requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code so complies), in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Plan and the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. The Committee shall also have the full power and authority to waive any such terms and conditions at any time (including, without limitation, accelerating or waiving any vesting conditions or payment dates), , , that the Committee shall not have the power or authority to make any amendment or modification to any outstanding Option which reduces the Option Price, either by lowering the Option Price or by cancelling the outstanding Option and granting a replacement Option with a lower Option Price. The Committee shall require payment of any amount it may determine to be necessary to withhold for federal, state, local or other taxes as a result of the exercise of an Award. The Participant may elect to pay a portion or all of such withholding taxes by having Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the statutory minimum withholding liability withheld by the Company from any Shares that would have otherwise been received by the Participant.

No Awards may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, but Awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.
 
Options granted under the Plan shall be, as determined by the Committee, non-qualified stock options or ISOs for federal income tax purposes, as evidenced by the related Award Agreements, and shall be subject to the foregoing and the following terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement:
(a) . The Option Price shall be determined by the Committee, but in no event shall it be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date an Option is granted.
Option Price
(b) . Options granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee, as reflected in the Award Agreements, but in no event shall an Option be exercisable prior to the date which is one year following the date of grant of such Option and in no event shall an Option be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted.
Exercisability
(c) . Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in an Award Agreement, an Option may be exercised for all, or from time to time any part, of the Shares for which it is then exercisable. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, no Shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the aggregate Option Price and any withholding amount required therefore is received by the Company. Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, payment of the aggregate Option Price may be made (i) in cash, or its equivalent, (ii) by transferring Shares or other equity securities of the Company or its Affiliates having a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate Option Price for the Shares being purchased to the Company and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Committee; that
Exercise of Options
provided
such Shares or equity securities have been held by the Participant for no less than six months (or such other period as established from time to time by the Committee or generally accepted accounting principles), (iii) if there is a public market for the Shares at such time, subject to such rules as may be established by the Committee, through delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell the Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Option and deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the aggregate Option Price, (iv) to the extent it does not result in adverse accounting treatment to the Company (as reasonably determined by the Company), by having Shares that would otherwise have been delivered to the Participant upon exercise of an Option withheld by the Company or (v) such other method as approved by the Committee. No Participant shall have any rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares subject to an Option until the Participant has given written notice of exercise of the Option, paid in full for such Shares and, if applicable, has satisfied any other conditions imposed by the Committee pursuant to the Plan.
(d) . The Committee may grant Options under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs. Such ISOs shall comply with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. No ISO may be granted to any Participant who at the time of such grant is not an employee of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, no ISO may be granted to any Participant who at the time of such grant owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, unless (i) the Option Price for such ISO is at least 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the ISO is granted and (ii) the date on which such ISO terminates is a date not later than the day preceding the fifth anniversary of the date on which the ISO is granted. Any Participant who disposes of Shares acquired upon the exercise of an ISO either (I) within two years after the date of grant of such ISO or (II) within one year after the transfer of such Shares to the Participant, shall notify the Company of such disposition and of the amount realized upon such disposition. All Options granted under the Plan are intended to be non-qualified stock options, unless the applicable Award Agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be an ISO. If an Option is intended to be an ISO, and if for any reason such Option (or portion thereof) shall not qualify as an ISO, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option (or portion thereof) shall be regarded as a non-qualified stock option granted under the Plan; that such Option (or portion thereof) otherwise complies with the Plan's requirements relating to non-qualified stock options. In no event shall any member of the Committee, the Company or any of its Affiliates (or their respective employees, officers or directors) have any liability to any Participant (or any other Person) due to the failure of an Option to qualify for any reason as an ISO.
ISOs
provided
(e) . Wherever in this Plan or any Award Agreement a Participant is permitted to pay the Option Price or taxes relating to the exercise of an Option by delivering Shares, the Participant may, subject to procedures satisfactory to the Committee, satisfy such delivery requirement by presenting proof of beneficial ownership of such Shares, in which case the Company shall treat the Option as exercised without further payment and shall withhold such number of Shares from the Shares acquired by the exercise of the Option.
Attestation
 
(a) . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the sole and complete authority to determine the Participants to whom Stock Appreciation Rights shall be granted, the number of Shares to be covered by each Stock Appreciation Right, the grant price thereof and the conditions and limitations applicable to the exercise thereof, but in no event shall the grant price of a Stock Appreciation Right be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date the Stock Appreciation Right is granted. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with another Award, in addition to another Award, or freestanding and unrelated to another Award. Stock Appreciation Rights granted in tandem with or in addition to an Award may be granted either at the same time as the Award or at a later time.
Grant
(b) . A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the Participant to receive an amount equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over (B) the grant price per Share, times (ii) the number of Shares covered by the Stock Appreciation Right. The Committee shall determine whether a Stock Appreciation Right shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares.
Exercise and Payment
(c) . Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Committee shall determine, at or after the grant of a Stock Appreciation Right, the term, methods of exercise, methods and form of settlement, and any other terms and conditions of the Stock Appreciation Right. Any such determination by the Committee may be changed by the Committee from time to time and may govern the exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights granted or exercised prior to such determination as well as Stock Appreciation Rights granted or exercised thereafter. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it shall deem appropriate to the extent not inconsistent with Section 162(m) of the Code.
Other Terms and Conditions
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant Awards of Shares, rights to purchase Shares, Awards of restricted Shares, Awards of phantom stock units and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, Shares (). Such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be in such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, the right to receive one or more Shares (or the equivalent cash value of such Shares) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. Other Stock-Based Awards may be granted alone or in addition to any other Awards granted under the Plan. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine: (a) to whom and when Other Stock-Based Awards will be made; (b) the number of Shares to be awarded under (or otherwise related to) such Other Stock-Based Awards; (c) whether such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares; and (d) all other terms and conditions of such Other Stock-Based Awards (including, without limitation, the vesting provisions thereof and provisions ensuring that all Shares so awarded and issued shall be fully paid and non-assessable) to the extent not inconsistent with Section 162(m) of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, if any Other Stock-Based Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, any payment or benefits otherwise due thereunder to any Participant upon the Participant's termination of employment or consultancy or other service with the Company shall not be made until and unless such termination constitutes a "separation from service," as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code, and if at the time of any such separation from service with the Company the Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and the deferral of the commencement of payments or benefits otherwise payable thereunder as a result of such separation from service is necessary in order to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of any such payments or benefits thereunder (without reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Participant) until the date that is six months following the Participant's separation from service with the Company (or the earliest date permitted under Section 409A of the Code).

Change in Control
The granting of an Award under the Plan shall impose no obligation on the Company or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of a Participant and shall not lessen or affect the Company's or its Affiliates' rights to terminate the employment of such Participant. No Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards.
