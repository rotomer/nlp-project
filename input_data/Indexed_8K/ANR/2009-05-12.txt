Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Foundation") and Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Alpha") have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of May 11, 2009. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Foundation and Alpha will merge (the "Merger"), and the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") will be named Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. The Merger Agreement has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Foundation and Alpha.
As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Foundation, other than any shares owned by Alpha, will automatically be converted into the right to receive 1.0840 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation (the "Foundation Merger Consideration"), and each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Alpha, other than any shares owned by Foundation, will automatically become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (the "Alpha Merger Consideration"). Immediately following the Merger, Alpha's stockholders will own approximately 59% of the Surviving Corporation's common stock and Foundation's stockholders will own approximately 41% of the Surviving Corporation's common stock. All currently issued and outstanding options to purchase Foundation common stock will vest and be converted into vested options to purchase Surviving Corporation common stock, with adjustments to reflect the Exchange Ratio, and all outstanding options to purchase Alpha common stock will be converted into options to purchase Surviving Corporation common stock, without adjustment. Other outstanding equity-based awards of Foundation will either vest and be converted into the right to receive the Foundation Merger Consideration or be converted into vested and unvested awards with respect to Surviving Corporation common stock, as applicable. Other outstanding equity-based awards of Alpha will be converted into awards with respect to Surviving Corporation common stock. No fractional shares of Surviving Corporation common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Foundation's stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Foundation common stock. The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation will be comprised of 10 members, six of which will be current members of the Alpha board and four (three of whom independent) of which will be current members of the Foundation board. Upon the closing of the Merger, the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation will elect Michael J. Quillen as Chairman of the Board, Kevin S. Crutchfield as Chief Executive Officer and Kurt D. Kost as President. The headquarters of the Surviving Corporation will be in Abingdon, Virginia and for at least 18 months following the closing of the Merger the current offices of Foundation will be maintained at the location of its current headquarters in Linthicum Heights, Maryland.
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) approval of the Merger by stockholders of each of Foundation and Alpha, (ii) expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) authorization for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Surviving Corporation common stock issuable in connection with the Merger, (iv) declaration of effectiveness by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Foundation, (v) absence of any injunction or legal restraint prohibiting the Merger and absence of any legal proceeding by a governmental entity seeking to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the Merger and (vi) subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the respective representations and warranties of Foundation and Alpha and compliance by Foundation and Alpha with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. The closing of the Merger is not subject to the receipt of financing or receipt of any consent from lenders or bondholders of either Foundation or Alpha.
Foundation and Alpha have made customary and reciprocal representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants to (i) conduct their respective operations in all material respects according to their ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practice during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (ii) not engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period, (iii) convene and hold meetings of their respective stockholders to consider and vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, include the recommendation of their
 
respective Boards of Directors in favor of such adoption of the Merger Agreement in the joint proxy statement/prospectus to be mailed to stockholders and (v) not to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage inquiries, proposals or offers relating to alternative acquisition proposals or, subject to certain exceptions, engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.
The Merger Agreement contains certain customary and reciprocal termination rights for the parties, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a written definitive agreement for a "Superior Proposal," and provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement for such reason and in other specified circumstances, Foundation may be required to pay Alpha a termination fee of $53,100,000, or Alpha may be required to pay Foundation a termination fee of $75,400,000.
In connection with the Merger, on May 11, 2009, Foundation and Alpha entered into letter agreements (the "Consent Agreements") with Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank, N.A., UBS Loan Finance LLC, National City Bank, Citicorp North America, Inc. and PNC Bank, National Association, each of whom is a lender under Foundation's existing Credit Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2004, as amended and restated as of July 7, 2006, by and among Foundation Coal Corporation and Foundation PA Coal Company, LLC (the "Foundation Credit Agreement"). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Consent Agreements, such lenders have consented to an amendment to the Foundation Credit Agreement, providing, among other things, for the inclusion of Alpha and its subsidiaries as parties to and guarantors under the Foundation Credit Agreement. The amendment to the Foundation Credit Agreement will become effective subject to the receipt of consents from lenders having more than 50% of the loans and commitments under the Foundation Credit Agreement and is conditioned upon the closing of the Merger. The closing of the Merger is not conditioned on the effectiveness of the amendment to the Foundation Credit Agreement.

Investors and security holders should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Foundation, Alpha or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer or trustee, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that, (i) except as provided in Section 7.03 of these Bylaws with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors and (ii) the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Corporation has consented to such settlement.
Right to Indemnification
SECTION 7.02    .  In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 7.01 of these Bylaws, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in defending
Right to Advancement of Expenses
 
any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 7.02 or otherwise.
SECTION 7.03    .  If a claim under Section 7.01 or 7.02 of these Bylaws is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.

In (a) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that identification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
SECTION 7.04    .  Any indemnification to be provided under Section 7.01 or 7.02 of these Restated Bylaws (unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such paragraph. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the Board of Directors who are not
Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
 
parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by the stockholders.
SECTION 7.05    .  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article VII shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation as amended from time to time, Bylaws as amended from time to time, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
and  Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE:ANR) and Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:FCL) announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement under which the two companies will merge in an all-stock transaction, creating one of America's foremost coal producers.
ABINGDON, VA
LINTHICUM HEIGHTS, MD, May 12, 2009
The combined company will be the third-largest coal producer in the U.S., with 2008 pro forma revenues of $4.2 billion. Alpha and Foundation together operate 59 coal mines and 14 preparation plants and in combination will have one of the most expansive geographic footprints in the industry, reserves of more than 2.3 billion tons of coal, and an attractive growth profile. The combined company's scale of operations, diverse revenue stream, free cash flow generation capability and management depth will provide a platform to compete successfully in today's market environment and capitalize on the projected future growth in coal demand.
Alpha is a leading Eastern coal producer and the nation's largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the steel industry, operating 50 mines and 10 coal preparation plants in four states. Foundation is a diversified producer of thermal coal used by electric utilities, with 9 active mines, 4 preparation plants and coal reserves in Northern Appalachia, the Powder River Basin and Central Appalachia as well as reserves in the Illinois Basin.
The combined company would have an equity market capitalization of $3.5 billion and enterprise value of $4.0 billion as of today's announcement.
Terms of the Transaction
Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Foundation stockholders will receive 1.084 shares of the new company for each share of Foundation, and each share of Alpha will automatically become one share of the combined company. Based on the closing price of Alpha on May 8, 2009, consideration received by Foundation stockholders was valued at $32.73 per share. This will result in Foundation stockholders owning approximately 41 percent and Alpha stockholders owning approximately 59 percent of the new company on a fully diluted basis.
 
The exchange ratio is calculated as a 37 percent premium over the 5-day average closing price of Foundation shares ending May 8, 2009, relative to the 5-day average closing price of Alpha shares during the same period.
Statements of the Merging Parties
"We're creating a true U.S. leader in the energy sector with balance, size and scale," said Michael Quillen, chairman and CEO of Alpha. "Combining our resources and experience puts us in an excellent position to compete in both domestic and international coal markets, using a diverse array of production sources and marketing channels. This merger is a compelling proposition for Alpha stockholders, who benefit from diversification in other coal-producing basins, from potential synergies that Foundation's production sources may have with our coal blending and optimization business, and from combined reserve holdings nearly four times the size of what we hold today."
Kevin Crutchfield, Alpha's president, said, "It's particularly gratifying to execute on our previously stated intention to pursue transformational growth opportunities. I could not be more pleased with our merger partner, and I look forward not only to bringing our two organizations together through a seamless integration process, but also to pursuing additional growth opportunities."
James Roberts, chairman and CEO of Foundation, commented: "Today's announcement is exciting and rewarding for our stockholders and our employees. Foundation stockholders not only receive a significant premium, but they also gain an opportunity to participate in the upside potential of a diversified company that possesses the scale and asset quality to successfully compete in today's challenging market environment and on an expanded global stage. With one of the industry's strongest balance sheets and credit profiles, our new company will be well situated to invest in our future growth, which presents additional prospects for our stockholders and our employees. We look forward to working with Alpha to realize the many anticipated benefits of this combination."
Transaction Details
The all-stock transaction is valued at approximately $2.0 billion. The aggregate consideration comprises approximately 50 million new shares of the new company's common stock and the assumption of approximately $530 million of Foundation net debt.
In connection with the transaction, Alpha will use cash on hand to repay its existing senior secured credit facility (consisting of a $375 million revolving credit facility, under which there were no borrowings as of March 31, 2009, and a term loan facility, under which there were $233 million in borrowings as of March 31, 2009), preserve its 2.375% convertible senior notes, and seek to upsize its $85 million accounts receivable securitization facility. Also in connection with the transaction, Foundation's $298 million 7.25% senior notes and its senior secured credit facility (consisting of a $500 million revolving credit facility, under which there were no borrowings as of March 31, 2009, and a Term Loan A, under which there were $302 million in borrowings as of March 31, 2009) will remain outstanding. Alpha and Foundation have agreed to seek amendments to Foundation's existing credit agreements and bond indentures; however, consummation of the merger is not conditioned on such amendments being obtained or subject to any other financing contingency.
 
The combined company will have one of the strongest balance sheets and credit profiles in the U.S. coal industry. Assuming the successful amendment of Foundation's existing bank credit agreement, pro forma fiscal year 2008 leverage is expected to be 1.4 x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA). Total liquidity (including cash, cash equivalents and undrawn capacity under the revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility) is expected to be approximately $750 million. The combined company expects to generate substantial free cash flow in 2009 and 2010, which will facilitate debt reduction and support future growth initiatives.
The combined company expects to realize approximately $45 million in annual revenue and cost savings through administrative, sales and operating synergies beginning in 2010.
The transaction, based on management's current outlook for the pro forma company in 2010, is expected to be accretive to both adjusted diluted earnings per share and cash flow earnings per share in 2010.
Corporate Structure and Management
Upon completion of the merger, Michael Quillen, currently Alpha's chairman and CEO, will become chairman of the combined company. Kevin Crutchfield, currently Alpha's president, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, and Kurt Kost, Foundation's president and chief operating officer, will become president of the combined company. Upon completion of the merger, James Roberts, Foundation's chairman and CEO, will become a member of the combined company's board of directors, which will consist of six directors from Alpha and four directors from Foundation.
The combined company will retain the Alpha name and will be headquartered in Abingdon, Va. The new company will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under Alpha's current ticker symbol ANR.
Approvals and Closing of the Transaction
The boards of directors of Alpha and Foundation have each unanimously approved the terms of the definitive merger agreement and have recommended that their stockholders approve the transaction. The merger is subject to the approval of each company's stockholders and other customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to be completed later this year.
Alpha is being advised by Citi and its legal counsel is Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. Foundation is being advised by Barclays Capital Inc. and its legal counsel is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

The presentation that accompanies today's call can be viewed on both companies' websites and this call is scheduled to last one hour and will end by 9 a.m.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial information. During the call and webcast, Alpha and Foundation management will make some forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these statements and these statements should be considered in the context of the risk factors contained in the press release we issued this morning and which is posted on our website and Foundation's website and in our respective Forms 10-K and other SEC filings, which you can also access through both companies' websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Quillen.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Ted. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are very excited about today's announcement and the combined capabilities that both companies are bringing together in this merger. This is exactly the sort of transformational event that Alpha has been talking about for some time now and we hope to show you this morning how an Alpha/Foundation merger makes sense from a strategic standpoint and is good for shareholders of both companies.
I also want to thank all of Alpha's employees upfront for the tremendous accomplishment of building our Company up from the ground just a few short years ago to the exceptional opportunity we have at our hands today. This merger not only represents a giant leap forward for both businesses, but it should lead to greater opportunities for our employees in the future.
Before we get started, let me quickly walk you through today's agenda. I will start by giving you a summary of the transaction rationale, after which Jim will cover the macro environment and Kevin will walk you through the financials, including the innovative financing underlying this deal. After that, we will open the line to questions. Frank Wood and Eddie Neely, our CFOs, are also with us and available for the Q&A session.
Now we will turn to the first slide, which provides an overview of the transaction. The combination of our two companies will be achieved through an all-stock tax-free transaction. Foundation shareholders will receive 1.084 common shares of the new company for each Foundation share they own, representing a premium to Foundation shareholders of 37% based on the two companies' trailing five-day average closing stock prices as of May 8, 2009.
The aggregate consideration comprises about 54 million new shares of the combined company, which will be named Alpha Natural Resources. Foundation stockholders will own 41% of the new company and Alpha stockholders will own 59%. The merger is subject to customary regulatory approvals and the approval of both company stockholders. There is no financing contingency. A comprehensive financing strategy that involves among other things preserving Foundation's debt underlies the capitalization of the new company and Kevin will discuss that in a few minutes. Headquarters for the company will be in Abingdon, Virginia. We expect to complete the transaction in the second half of this year.
As I mentioned, this is exactly the sort of transformational combination that Alpha was talking about for some time and we believe that this is absolutely the right time to do it. In a sense, Alpha and Foundation have a kinship going through the IPO process just a few months apart in late 2004, early 2005 with some of the same private equity partners.
 
 
In a similar manner, we both share like values, including respecting and valuing our people and running our operations safely, ethically and in an environmentally responsible manner as evidenced by the many awards each of us has won. Jim is going to talk more about the many ways our culturals fit each other in a moment.
Bringing our two companies together will create a stronger competitor in today's dynamic industry environment. The combined company will be significantly stepped up in scale and scope with a meaningful combined reserve base and a diversity of assets both geographically and operationally. Alpha and Foundation both have outstanding records of consistent free cash flow generation and in combination, we will have one of the industry's strongest balance sheets and credit profiles.
Moving on to the next slide. Foundation is a great partner and optimal business fit for Alpha. Foundation is one of the most geographically diversified coal mining companies in the US with significant reserves and mining operations in four coal producing basins. They will complement Alpha's valuable metallurgical coal assets and thereby lessen revenue stream dependence on the sometimes volatile swings in the steel sector.
Foundation's larger scale operations, long walls and PRB surface mines complement our portfolio of 50 underground and surface mines and they have an attractive cost profile thanks to strong operational management. Foundation also has significant volumes of planned production committed and priced this year and next, which is an attractive hedge in this current market along with our committed profile. Jim will talk about this in a moment. As I mentioned early, Foundation has an excellent track record, like Alpha, when it comes to generating free cash flow.
Finally, this is more than just a combination of hard assets; it is about a good fit of people and core values and how we approach our businesses. Jim is also going to address that.
The next slide shows graphically how Alpha's and Foundation's asset base fits each other. We will have an extremely well-balanced portfolio of operations and reserves. Our 59 mines and 14 preparation plants will be serviced by the four major railroads. As mentioned, Foundation brings to the table a top quality management team with a track record of delivering strong and sustainable cash flows from their assets. In particular, Kurt Kost will be instrumental in seeing that this performance continues as he leads operations for our new company.
This transaction combines the largest metallurgical coal supplier in the nation, Alpha, with the nation's most diversified producer of thermal coal for electric utilities, Foundation. Thus, creating a new US leader with the global scale and scope to compete in an increasingly competitive market.
Among publicly traded US producers on a pro forma basis, the new Alpha will be number three in market cap, number three in revenues on a last 12 months basis, number four in EBITDA based on the last 12 months and number three in total coal production with more than 91 million tons of production in the last 12 months.
The combined company would possess a greater array of production sources and marketing channels, diversification of cost revenue streams in coal producing basins and four times the reserves holdings Alpha has today. Together, we will be better positioned to meet continuing demand in both domestic and international markets for thermal and metallurgical coal. In addition, we will be able to leverage this increased scale and scope to manage costs and diversify operating risk.
Now I'm going to turn it over to Jim who has some remarks concerning how we are positioned competitively and why we feel, from a market perspective, this is an opportune time to merge our two businesses.
Jim Roberts -
Foundation Coal - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. This morning, I am very excited to be able to discuss this business combination with all of Foundation Coal's stakeholders, equity investors, bondholders and employees alike. Mike just laid out many of the positive attributes and the rationale for this merger, but I would like to discuss the benefits from the perspective of Foundation.
The first thing I would note is exactly the same as Mike's first observation. This transaction increases the scale and the scope of our operations and creates a truly premier US coal company. Scale is important for a number of reasons, including lower costs and breadth of product and as Kevin will discuss in a moment, greater scale is also usually accompanied by increased valuation multiples, which should create value for the shareholders of both companies.
 
 
When I think about the national footprint and the geographic diversification of the combined company, I am struck by the nearly equal distribution of our combined 2.3 billion tons of reserve between Northern Appalachia, Central Appalachia and the Powder River Basin. Due to the high-volume nature of surface mining in the West, PRB production accounts for just over half of our total volume, while Central Appalachia, on a trailing pro forma basis, contributed nearly 30% and Northern Appalachia contributed just under 20%.
The combination of Foundation with its strong presence, regionally diverse thermal coal production and Alpha with its industry-leading metallurgical coal production should provide a relative security of diversification, as well as the potential upside of being the largest met coal producer when the economy turns around and demand for met coal resumes.
From the perspective of Foundation Coal where met coal has historically contributed 2% or less of our total production, we view this as an exciting opportunity to benefit from a recovery in the potentially high margin and often volatile met coal market.
The combined company will also be among the most diversified in terms of its mining methods, employing a combination of longwall mining, CM mining and surface mining in the East, as well as large-scale surface mining operations in the Powder River Basin. This diversification should help mitigate potential regulatory impacts as increasing political pressure is mounting on various mining methods and the issuance of some permits.
The next slide shows that, as a combined company, we will be well-positioned to benefit from the eventual recovery in the coal markets. Demand for electricity is projected to decrease for the second consecutive year as a result of the current economic slowdown and global steel production has declined sharply. However, both domestic demand for electricity and global steel production are forecast to begin growing again in 2010 and beyond. Such a recovery will provide a significant opportunity for our combined company.
Given the recent decrease in demand, coal prices have come under significant pressure, production cuts are being implemented by most producers, many high-cost mines have been closed and more can be expected in the future. So when demand growth does return for steam and electrical coals, supply will struggle to keep up with demand and prices will likely experience a sharp recovery.
Long term, the coal industry fundamentals continue to be strongly favorable. The United States will demand more electricity in the future and while the Energy Information Administration forecasts that other sources like renewables and natural gas may grow faster, albeit from a smaller base, you simply cannot provide America's future electricity needs without coal and the amount of coal needed will continue to increase.
Globally, the fundamentals are stronger still. According to the world energy outlook 2008, global primary energy met demand will grow by more than 40% by 2030 with coal demand rising more than other energy sources in absolute terms. In particular, China and India alone are expected to account for 85% of the increase in global coal demand through 2030. Clearly as the global economy grows over the long term, the use of steel will also continue to grow, driving greater demand for metallurgical coals as well.
Looking at this next slide, while we are convinced at the positive long-term outlook for the coal industry, we are also realistic about the challenging near-term environment. That is why this business combination is attractive in the near term. Through the successful sales and marketing efforts of both companies up to this point, we are highly hedged on a pro forma basis, leaving little exposure to uncontracted positions.
For the two companies combined, 100% of our Powder River Basin coal is committed and priced for 2009. Nearly all of our Eastern steam coal is committed and priced and approximately 60% of our metallurgical coal is committed and priced. We are also heavily contracted as we look out to 2010 when 80% of our Powder River Basin coal and roughly 60% of our Eastern steam coal is committed and priced. And we have substantial exposure to met coal upside through the anticipated rebound in the steel market. This highly hedged pro forma book of business will enable the combined company to deliver strong financial results during a period of relatively weak spot market prices and positions us to take maximum benefit of the eventual recovery in the coal markets in the future.
Finally, I believe this transaction brings together two companies that have highly compatible values and cultures. When we compared Alpha's core values to Foundation's guiding principles, the alignment was immediately clear. Both companies share a strong commitment to ethics, safety, operational excellence, continuous improvement, corporate citizenship, environmental stewardship, customer satisfaction, teamwork and a commitment to treat all stakeholders with respect and dignity. These values are evident in the way both companies run their operations and I believe that the employees of both companies can expect a consistent culture as we move forward integrating ourselves into a single company.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the employees of Foundation for their hard work and dedication that has enabled our company to succeed and grow throughout our history. I'm excited about our future prospects and I believe that this transaction represents a positive and monumental step forward for both companies, creating enhanced values for investors and creating additional opportunities for our employees. I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin for a discussion of the financial aspects of the transaction.
 
 
Kevin Crutchfield
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
Thanks, Jim and good morning. Turning to the financing, our approach has been to utilize the financing plan that ensures the pro forma company a balance sheet that is one of the best in the industry and provides us the adequate financial flexibility to react to today's market. This plan takes advantage of Alpha's cash balance and Foundation's already attractive debt profile.
On the Alpha side, we cancel our revolving $375 million revolving credit facility and repay our $233 million term B loan with cash on hand. We will retain our $288 million of convertible notes, which provide a long-term source of low-cost 2
 3
/
8
% debt and we intend to pursue upsizing of our accounts receivable securitization facility to $150 million given the larger receivables space we will have.
On the Foundation side, our strategy is to preserve the existing $500 million revolving credit facility and $300 million of term loan A. In order to do so, we will need to amend these facilities. The amendment that we will seek does not require us to make any changes to the financial covenants. We look forward to the support from both companies' lender groups as this transaction allows them to participate in an enhanced credit and for many of them, an opportunity to reduce their combined exposure. Also, we plan on preserving the Company's 7.25% senior notes due 2014. As Mike mentioned earlier, there is no financing contingency.
The next slide provides a more detailed view of the financing plan and the pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2009. As you can see, the pro forma company will have a total debt of approximately $900 million. This results in a debt to LTM EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. Importantly, the pro forma company will have a very favorable debt maturity profile. We will only have our revolving credit facility and term A maturing in the next two years. Our notes and our convert do not mature until 2014 and 2015 respectively. With cash of approximately $400 million, the revolver and the accounts receivables securitization, Alpha will have over $700 million of net liquidity. We will continue to utilize some of our liquidity to provide letters of credit for surety bonds and other operating requirements.
Turning to the next slide on liquidity. This shows the relative position of the pro forma company, vis-a-vis the US coal producer peer group. Our leverage, cash balance and liquidity are among the best in the industry. Additionally, as you can see from the chart in the bottom right, the pro forma company has and continues to be a leader in cash generation. We will continue to focus on this going forward as we have in the past. It is one of our key financial objectives. Continuing to focus on cash generation will provide us further opportunities to deliver and add liquidity going forward.
Summing it up, the new Alpha has one of the best balance sheets in the industry and the flexibility to pursue further opportunities if they arise in the form of strategic and perhaps distressed assets. We remain committed to our guiding principle of maintaining a sound balance sheet and sensible growth will be considered solely within that context. That is what you can expect from the new Alpha.
Another benefit of combining Alpha and Foundation is the opportunity to realize a significant amount of synergies as we show on this slide. Annual pretax synergies are conservatively estimated to be $45 million with the full run rate realized by later in 2010. The synergies represent an approximate after-tax net present valuation of about $275 million. We expect the synergies to occur in three primary buckets  sales and blending, operations and strategic sourcing, and administration.
As we have discussed before, lending and physical brokerage is a tool that Alpha has utilized since its inception to create value for its customers. By combining the assets of the two companies, we will have another 70 million tons around which to create optimization and arbitrage opportunities.
We think the combination of this, our ownership position at Dominion Terminal Associates and additional high-quality metallurgical coal from the Foundation portfolio will generate substantial opportunities to create additional value for all of our stakeholders.
On the operations and strategic sourcing side, we will be combining the spend of each company across a common strategic sourcing group, which we believe will generate substantial savings and efficiencies and cost reductions across a wide array of products and services we utilize, including our capital equipment needs and basic mining inputs.
Though the competition for labor has subsided since last year, we believe combining our operations in Central Appalachia under one common management team will generate additional efficiencies and operational optimization opportunities.
 
 
With regard to the administrative side, two public companies will become one, which automatically reduces duplicative costs across a wide array of governance, audit and other regulatory compliance categories. Additionally, we'll see savings and other public company category costs like the insurance portfolio, benefits, consulting, legal fees and the like. We are not prepared today to disclose the values to each of these three buckets individually other than to say we are confident that realizing $45 million of annual synergies is achievable and quite realistic on an aggregate basis. We actually think there could be considerably more savings in the long run once we get into it, but the $45 million to $50 million range is all we are prepared to commit to today. We would certainly plan to keep you updated on our progress against this target and as we identify others along the way.
The next slide shows the Alpha/Foundation and the pro forma company management estimates of operating performance for 2010. As we have discussed, the long-term outlook for coal is very positive irrespective of some of the temporary choppiness in the current operating environment. Our range of estimates for 2010 incorporates our view that the operating environment both globally and domestically for key end products, electricity demand and steel production, will be at improved levels from current performance. With that, the demand for coal will benefit.
The combination of the committed and priced tons for our steam coal, a favorable cost environment, opportunities to optimize our capital spend and the realization of synergies will allow us to have an outstanding 2010. Based upon the midpoint of the range, we believe the merger will be accretive to earnings and cash flow per share in 2010. Accretion is projected to be 2% and 47% on a GAAP EPS and cash flow per share basis respectively. When we evaluate acquisitions, our focus is on maximizing recurring cash flow. We feel this provides a very transparent way to create and continue to increase shareholder value over the long term.
On the next slide, I would like to comment how the benefits of the transaction will translate into benefits for the shareholders. In our industry, coal stocks with scale and diversity have had a fairly consistent history of trading at a premium valuation. As you can see from the graph, the larger and more diversified industry peers trade at 1 to 1.5 turns above the average Central App producer on an EV to EBITDA basis. Individually, Alpha and Foundation haven't quite had either the scale or diversity to fall into this peer group. With this transaction, the new Alpha addresses that.
Also, we will continue our focus on cash flow and capital returns striving to be the leader in the industry, which we believe will continue to support value creation for our shareholders. We think investors should benefit in our trading performance due to the balance sheet strength and future growth opportunities that we have touched on.
We'll turn to your questions after this last slide. Let me just sum up by saying that this is the right transaction at the right time for the right reasons. The merger increases the scale and scope of our respective companies and creates an industry-leading US coal company. It diversifies operating risk, establishes a balanced regional mix of production and sales through a national footprint.
We'll have a combined reserve base of 2.3 billion tons of multiple types of coals feeding into a blending and optimization network of 14 preparation facilities. The new company will be well situated with a nicely committed sales book to help us do well in the current business environment while being leveraged to an attractive long-term outlook for met and steam coal going forward.
We see estimated annual synergies of at least $45 million beginning in 2010 and finally, we will have an industry-leading balance sheet with strong liquidity positions for future growth, strong cash flow generation history and potential and a combined management team that has delivered in the past and is determined to do so for the new Alpha and its shareholders. And with that, I think we are now ready to take your questions and I will turn it back over to the operator.
QUESTION AND ANSWER
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Jim Rollyson, Raymond James.
Jim Rollyson
- Raymond James - Analyst
Congratulations, everybody. First question, is there a breakup for you guys?
 
 
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
There is a breakup fee, a standard fee. I think it is around 3.5%, so it's a standard fee that would be acceptable in this type of transaction.
Jim Rollyson
- Raymond James - Analyst
And Mike, just given, I guess, your recent past history, have you guys felt out shareholders at all yet just to get a sense of how everybody  (inaudible) people pretty comfortable with the deal or it is that yet to come?
-
Mike Quillen
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
That's a very good question. Yes, we are comfortable with where our shareholders are. I think that they see this combination coming about. It has been maybe predicted and expected for some time. We think that we have been pretty forthright in our desire to grow our Company. So we see it as  and there are very many similar shareholders amongst the two companies. So we don't anticipate any of the issues that we faced in the last situation we went through in 08.
Jim Rollyson
- Raymond James - Analyst
And maybe, Mike, one last one just from your perspective or from Alpha's perspective, kind of what drew you into getting into the PRB? Is it simply diversification or is it also the growth opportunity there or just kind of what is the thought process?
-
Mike Quillen
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, as we have mentioned several times, we have had interest in the PRB, but to really get into the PRB as a greenfield, there is not a very big opportunity. So you really have to look for an opportunity to go with one of the existing producers. And the two things that really lead us to be excited about the PRB are, one, it gives us  is the diversity and geographic footprint we have been looking for. It also gives us a hedge against the highly profitable, but somewhat erratic, metallurgical steel business because of the consistency of that steam product.
And there also are some blending opportunities coming up in the Midwest for those products matched up with some of our other coal. So that is  it's an area we have been interested in and now we have the opportunity to try to use our optimization to enhance that, but it also gives us a strong base against our metallurgical products.
-
Jim Rollyson
Raymond James - Analyst
And if everything goes as expected, roughly speaking, when are you guys expecting this to close?
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
We would expect  of course, we have to go through the normal regulatory approvals. HSR should not be a big issue due to the diversification of the products and the operations. We would expect that to be 60 to 90 days, so sometime in the August/September timeframe.
Jim Rollyson
- Raymond James - Analyst
Great. Thanks, guys.

Luther Lu, FBR Capital Markets.
 
 
Luther Lu
- FBR Capital Markets - Analyst
Congratulations, guys.
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Good morning, Luther.
Luther Lu
- FBR Capital Markets - Analyst
I want to ask you guys  certainly, there is a lot of assets that are still for sale in the Powder River Basin. Can either of the companies go after the assets during this merger process?
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, I mean we have got a lot of work to do with integration and getting this deal done, so we are not going to take our eye off the ball of completing this transaction. As we go forward, obviously, the way we have structured this balance sheet is to continue to grow and take advantage of opportunities, whether distressed or whether they are just in different geographic basins. So yes, we're still going to be around in the M&A environment going forward, but our goal in front of us right now is to get this transaction consummated, integrated and then we will see what the next step is. Jim, do you want to add anything to that?
Jim Roberts
- Foundation Coal - Chairman & CEO
No, I think that is  Mike, I think that is the right approach. This is a great opportunity for both of our companies and I think we need to stay focused on getting it completed and it sets the new company up for exactly what you just mentioned for the future.
Luther Lu
- FBR Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. And in terms of shareholder approval, is this a standard 50% approval from each company or something different like last time?
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, both of these are Delaware corporations. We don't have a situation like we had the last time with the Ohio rules and procedures. I think it is 50% of voting  50% of outstanding shares.
Luther Lu
- FBR Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. And the breakup fee is equal on the both sides?
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
On a percentage basis, yes.
Luther Lu
- FBR Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. Thank you very much.

Shneur Gershuni, UBS.
Shneur Gershuni -
UBS - Analyst
Kevin, Mike, I was just wondering if you could sort of rewalk us through the strategies with respect to this transaction and kind of specifically, given your unhedged position for 2010, is this kind of a statement on where you think pricing will be for 2010 as you will be more hedged? Also, if you could sort of walk through once again sort of the  some of the benefits here? You had mentioned there was $45 million in synergies and so forth, but also if you can talk us through some of the other rationale? Is it effectively going to be an arbitrage of Foundation's debt and a hope for lower cost of capital or do you see some  also some longer-term opportunities with respect to some of Foundation's assets on the CapEx side?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
You may have to repeat some of that question in a minute because I am not sure I can handle all that. I think, from a strategic standpoint, I think we covered a lot of that in the presentation that we made. But obviously, we did look at it as a balance between the already committed position of Foundation, which gives us again a good solid base and then it gives us the opportunity with some of the uncommitted tons to, one, be able to get the right market price for those. In other words, there's not quite as much pressure maybe to go out and place a ton and we can, again, go over the margin analysis that we use to try to get the highest margin for our tons.
So I think what it does, it gives a good floor base, it gives us a very predictable positive cash flow for the company going forward and it gives us a real upside when this market moves, which it is going to move. We recognize where we are in the economic global situation, we recognize where we are with the steel companies but those things are going to come back. Electricity generation in the United States will come back with the economy, so we will have an open position that we can increase value with. But during that time, we also have a strong base of committed and priced tons at a profit that will continue to enhance our financial metrics. Kevin, do you have anything?
Kevin Crutchfield -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
Yes, let me just hit the synergies for a second, Shneur. I mean as I said on the call, I think we have taken a pretty conservative view of what we think those are. And we are clearly looking at synergies in a pretty rough business environment, but we think, long term, they could be considerably higher. And when it comes to the operating sales and blending optimization side, we think there is a tremendous amount of value there that we can create. And through the process of working alongside the folks at Foundation, there are limitations as to what you can do in terms of markets just to stay clean. So we think there is a whole untouched area there that there is a lot of value that can be created in the future. So we are coming out today with what we believe to be numbers that are readily achievable, but also conservative and we would expect to keep you updated on that as we go forward.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
One last comment, Shneur, is that, as we look at these, one attribute that is not financial that is very important in being able to put two companies, particularly of this size, together and that is the chemistry and the way that the companies operate and we are very, very comfortable that the chemistry between these two met companies is very like-minded. We think the integration, particularly on the operational and mining side, will be seamless and be very effective. We will obviously have some issues to deal with on the system side that we have to deal with with the size of these two companies. But as I have said many times, there are a lot of mergers that make sense when you put them together on paper and add the numbers up, but a lot of it comes down to the personalities of the companies and the fit and we think this is a perfect one for the two companies here.
Shneur Gershuni -
UBS - Analyst
Okay, if I can just ask one last question just with respect to the  with the leverage situation and so forth. Are any of Foundation's pieces callable as a result of the transaction? And if you can sort of walk us through any interesting covenant situations that might arise as a result of this.
 
 
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
We will ask Frank to address that.
Frank Wood
- - Foundation Coal - SVP & CFO
Yes, Shneur, no, none of our debt is callable as a result of this transaction. The deal is specifically structured so that our debt can remain in place. And while there will be a bank amendment, it will be (inaudible) that was referenced in the materials. The things we are asking to change in that bank amendment are going to be pretty much on the administrative end, so there won't be any significant covenant changes.
Shneur Gershuni
- UBS - Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you very much and good luck with this.
Mike Quillen

Michael Dudas, Jefferies.
Michael Dudas
- Jefferies & Co. - Analyst
Good morning. Well done, gentlemen.
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Michael.
Michael Dudas
- Jefferies & Co. - Analyst
For anybody who would like to take it, can you maybe give your thoughts on your Central Appalachian operations with the combination of Foundation and any change in thoughts on the future of Central Appalachia? Would this deal give some sort of sense that you are less bullish about the overall margin or value trend opportunities that come from that region?
Mike Quillen
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I am going to turn that over to Kevin real quickly, but just so  I want to specifically respond to your question are we less optimistic. We are very optimistic about Central Appalachia. That is one of the highest margin, most profitable areas and this enhances, between the two companies', assets in that region. We will get synergy, we will get opportunities there, but that is a real positive and Kevin, I will let you and Kurt respond on the other operational issues.
Kevin Crutchfield
- Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
Sure. I mean we have never really shied away from the fact that Central Appalachia is a contracting basin. I mean we have never tried to debate that and we continue to believe that that is going to occur. But at the end of the day, that doesn't mean you can't make a lot of money in Central Appalachia, which we think we have done a fairly good job of proving.
 
 
But from a strategic rationale standpoint, we recognize that, long term, to achieve the kind of valuations that we thought were appropriate for what was being accomplished, that we needed to broaden our scale and scope and our regional diversity and of all the opportunity sets out there, as Mike and Jim alluded to earlier, we think Foundation is definitely the right fit across a wide array of metrics, including the culture where their operations are positioned, the high quality of the management team, their operational excellence. So look, I still think you can do just fine in Central Appalachia and there is going to be a lot of opportunities remaining in Central Appalachia that we will continue to look at. But this was the opportunity to expand our national reach and we didn't want to let it get away from us. Anything you would like to add to that, Kurt?
Kurt Kost -
Foundation Coal - President & COO
Yes, just we are excited about bringing in our assets in Central Appalachia, particularly our Rockspring and Kingston properties. We have got a very low cost profile at Rockspring of we have got a great team and a great product at the Kingston property and by combining it with Alpha's portfolio, we think we can optimize those operations and just make a bigger better Central App operational all around. So it is going to be a good move for us and we're excited about it.
Michael Dudas -
Jefferies & Co. - Analyst
Mike or Kevin, do you think this transaction maybe is the best mitigation relative to the EPA situation relative to surface mine permitting and waste disposal?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I'm not sure there is any mitigating what's maybe going on in the environmental arena today. We are all in this together. It does actually spread out the risk with  the PRB is not under the same pressures that we are in Central and Northern App with the valley field type situation. We all have to monitor closely where this country goes in terms of its energy policy, but it does spread out the risk a little bit, but these are just the issues we have got to deal with going forward and both companies are actively engaged in moving forward in the political arena in which we find ourselves today. Jim?
Jim Roberts -
Foundation Coal - Chairman & CEO
I would just add that, obviously, this was a big issue for both of our companies when we were talking about merging together. And the point I would like to make is that, from a permitting point of view in the near term, both companies are very well situated. I am not going to say that we don't have issues, we don't see any major issues with our permitting process over the near term in the next few years.
Long term, everybody is in the same situation. If it isn't mitigated some way, either through regulatory process or through legislative process, it is going to have an impact on everybody throughout the country. But right now, both companies are in pretty good shape.
Michael Dudas -
Jefferies & Co. - Analyst
Fair enough. One final follow-up, could you maybe share with us the composition of the combined company's labor force, primarily in Appalachia? Does it help change the average age of the experience of the miners and is this something that certainly is one of the more positive aspects that you would look at relative to the combination?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I don't think there is a dramatic change. I think both companies probably have close to the same metrics. It is going to be relative to the operations, but both of them were created from prior companies. So I don't have that statistic in front of me. I think there is going to be about 6200 employees of the combined companies, but we can get that for you, but I don't think we have actually even done that yet to see how the metrics of age. Kurt, have you got a comment?

Could you  Mike, from your perspective, you're going to pick up a bit more union assets. Have you had any discussions with the unions? Do you see any potential problems there?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, the union has been contacted. I mean Alpha has existing union operations now. We have a great relationship with them. That is an employee choice of how they structure that and those are profitable, safely operated mines and really don't expect any issues out of that. We have had none with the union operations that we have today and Foundation certainly has had a good relationship with their union operations. So I think there are really no issues there. We have, obviously, informed the union of the situation.
Pearce Hammond -

And then, Jim, from your standpoint, you have the lawsuit right now for the metallurgical coal. Just curious, as a combined company given the size of the metallurgical coal position of the combined outfit, would that change the outlook for that lawsuit?
Jim Roberts -
Foundation Coal - Chairman & CEO
Well, I don't  again, we don't like to comment on outstanding litigation. I think you have to look at that as an event on its own within the confines of the contract that we have. No, I wouldn't say that the combining of the companies is going to have any impact on that particular issue.
 
 
Pearce Hammond -

Great. And then, Mike, from your perspective, what do you see as the greatest potential hindrance to getting this deal closed? Would it be utilities or a counterbid or the government? What do you see?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I really don't see any. If there were an unusual event outside of our control and I don't know, just some situation, a war, for example, but something totally out of our control could change the environment. Without an external event, I don't really see anything that should stand in the way. I think it is very good for both shareholder groups. We will be speaking with shareholders over the next week or so and answering any questions. But I don't really see any impediments in front of this transaction. We hope to get it closed quickly, get our regulatory filings in and get that response and move forward.

Thank you, good morning. A couple questions. First, and I apologize if you mentioned this earlier, but given the increased interest in thermal coal brought on from Foundation, can you just talk to strategically whether there has been any change in how you are looking at thermal coal versus met coal medium to longer term?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, the whole team has been in this business a long, long time and the way we look at it is metallurgical coal is a cyclical industry. You make a very good return on your assets when that market is up and you really need a baseload to carry those type of mining operations when we are in a situation like we are now in the steel industry. The steam market is much more stable. It is maybe not as profitable on a per-ton basis on any particular time period, but it is more consistent, it is stable and strong cash flow. So low-cost operations in the steam arena like Foundation has gives you a great floor to manage from and then you take the opportunity when it comes along in the metallurgical side. And that is why this is such a good fit between these two companies' assets.
Brian Singer -
Goldman Sachs - Analyst
Thanks. And on a follow-up or a separate question, I believe you all still have a sizable cash balance post-transaction given the all-stock nature of this deal. And I was wondering if you could talk about how you are thinking about that and whether you would consider additional consolidation or use that towards debt paydown or reinvestment in the business?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I lost a bet. I thought I would get through one call without somebody asking us what we want to do with our cash because we spent a little bit of it. Still with the $400 million of cash left, that does put us certainly in the upper tier of financial strength of the public coal companies. And that is why we structured the deal this way. Again, it is a little bit unique by paying off the Alpha debt and retaining the Foundation debt, particularly because of their term and their interest rates, but it did allow us to preserve a significant amount of cash. We think this is a positive cash generator going forward.
 
 
So as we look through 2010, the opportunity is to increase that. And as we said before, we have got work to do, we have got to close the deal and integration, but we also still have as our modus operandi is to use our liquidity to continue to grow this company. So yes, we are still in the acquisition mode. We have got a little bit of work to do over the next several months, but we will still be there when the opportunity comes along.

Good morning. A housekeeping question. On slide 8, you referenced pro forma EBITDA as $664 million. I would've thought it would be something like $850 million if I take Alpha's adjusted EBITDA of $534 million for 08 and I take Foundation's adjusted EBITDA of $314 million. Can you just help me bridge the difference?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Again, that is through March, so that is the last 12 months. So you're going to be taking three quarters of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. And as we are aware, Foundation had several longwall moves in the first quarter, so  and I don't have your numbers in front of me, but I am suspecting that, if you go back and look at that on 2008 for both companies, you could probably come maybe to your numbers. I am not sure. Is that correct?
Laurence Jollon -
Barclays Capital - Analyst
Yes, I have done that as well and I still don't get close to the $664 million, and I can follow up.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
We will follow up.
Laurence Jollon -
Barclays Capital - Analyst
The reason I ask, Michael, is just your pro forma leverage metrics would look a lot more attractive if you are obviously using the higher EBITDA number.
Mike Quillen -

We will check that.
Laurence Jollon -
Barclays Capital - Analyst
Okay. And then my second question, not to be difficult, someone earlier mentioned that there was no change of control put in the 7.25% Foundation bonds. I just wanted to confirm that because it is our understanding there is change of control language. I guess the question is the deal was structured in such a way that that change of control language is not triggered. Is that fair?

Good morning and congratulations. In terms of your total production, at lease for your estimates, it looks like you just added up the production previous guidance from the two companies for the most part. I was wondering if, kind of given the current environment and now that you will be a much bigger company, if you have thought about potential production optimization, maybe leaving some more 2010 tonnage in the ground or how should we look at that?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
We will, obviously, look at rationalization as we go forward. I mean we have looked at that in both companies' due diligence, but we will be very active  that is a fluid situation in this market. So we are not  we are in this business to make profit and value for our shareholders. The total tons is not a metric that drives us, so if rationalization makes more sense, we certainly would do that. And you are correct. I mean what we have done today is just added up the two numbers, but as we come up with a total business model going forward, that number could change if it turns out to be more profitable.
Jeremy Sussman
- Natixis - Analyst
Great. And now on the flipside, you have also given production capacity from each of the region's PRB, North App and Central App. Assuming the markets were to turn quicker than expected, how quickly could you sort of ratchet things up to get to those sort of numbers?
 
 
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I think both companies could return to where they were in 2008 fairly rapidly. I think most of our reductions have been either in purchased coal, contracted coal or less hours worked per existing unit. We haven't turned off a whole lot of employees yet, so I think we could react fairly quickly. I'd let Kevin and Kurt respond.
Kevin Crutchfield -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
The other thing that I would add on those production capacities that you are referring to on page seven is those are produced and processed types of capacities. That excludes any (technical difficulty) to continue to conduct our trading or brokerage business. And this history has reflected  I mean we have demonstrated the ability to make that (inaudible) 5 million, 5.5 million tons to create additional opportunities. So I think we could respond pretty quickly if the market situation warrants it.

Hi, guys. Just regarding  I think one of you made comments about blending potential. Are you seeing any more demand from the utilities for blended PRB product or is this just something that you think you can leverage a new business opportunity going forward? Thanks.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
It is actually not new for Alpha. I mean we have been purchasing coal out of the PRB for blending up in the Midwest for several years  well, actually since we were formed. So it is a process we have been into. We have looked at opportunities to bring PRB to the East to blend with our lower sulfur high BTU Central App coal. And so we think there is continuing opportunities there, but it is really not new. We have been doing that for quite some time. We think, with the Clean Air Act and what is forthcoming possibly to enhance that and scrubbers that are coming online, that there will even be some more opportunity for that. And as I said, we will be on all four railroads, so that enhances that opportunity.
Mark Liinamaa -
Morgan Stanley - Analyst
So not new, I agree, but are you seeing any change in appetite for it and specifically because of the changes in regulation that could be coming even though we don't know what they look like yet?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, I think the utilities would like  a product between Central Appalachia coal and PRB works very well in the boilers, particularly in the Southeast and then all of the East versus say just the straight PRB product. So a company that can provide them that product and give it to them on an already-blended basis or an already-analyzed basis I think will be an asset in our marketing portfolio.

Mark Parr -
KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst
Thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, I was wondering, one of the things that caught me in your release and  I guess, first of all, just to make a comment about  you are creating a more diversified mix between thermal and met coal, which really seems prudent from a longer-term perspective and I think probably will help to add to your value proposition in the market. But you mentioned about looking for both strategic and distressed assets. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how  what is the difference between those two and how you would approach them and which side of that spectrum do you think you would be placing more emphasis on in the next several years?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, first, to just make a comment. Obviously, we think this makes sense. However, I am sure if we had done this transaction in the middle of last year when met coal was white hot, it might not be viewed the same. But we think over the long term, and this company will be picking up or adding to 1.5 million some additional met tons from the Foundation side, plus some substantial net reserves that they have in their portfolio, so we're still going to be  we will be the largest met producer going forward, even larger than we were previously. Again, as you look at the portfolio of assets, that goes forward. I kind of forgot what your question was while I'm babbling here.
Kevin Crutchfield -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
Let me take a shot at it. I mean, look, from a strategic standpoint, we, obviously, want to do things that make strategic sense and to the extent that we can find a strategic asset that is distressed, that is even better. So I think maybe your question is would we buy something just because it is cheap. Well, no, not if it doesn't make any sense. I mean I don't know how to answer your question any more succinctly than just that.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I mean I think the distinction between synergistic is probably the right word and  when we say distressed, what we mean is we recognize particularly a lot of the private companies are under tremendous pressure for acquiring capital. They are under pressure from a regulatory environment. They are under pressure from a permitting environment. So I think, even though last year they would probably price different, I think there is more fair pricing out there from a buyer and seller's perspective right now.
And just because of the financial situation  this is a cash flow business, so when we say distressed, companies that don't have strong cash flow are probably going to be in a situation where they may have to do something that maybe they are not necessarily desirous to do. That is not their number one option, but selling out is  turns out to be the thing that is the best for them and we will take that opportunity if it comes along.
But at the same time, I don't think we're going to focus on one over the other. I think we are going to  as we have always done, we both have strong M&A groups and they will continue to look at opportunities to go along and the synergistic ones bring a lot of value whatever size they are and now we can do that in all four  continue to do that in all four basins.
Mark Parr -
KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst
Okay. And just if I could ask one follow-up, because there has been so much press devoted to, I guess, increasing resistance of the use of coal to produce energy going forward, I mean at the government level. And I am wondering what this combination does for your lobbying efforts or for your ability to more effectively address Washington or have critical mass in that regard. And if you could bring some color on that, I would really appreciate it. Thanks very much.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Jim is well-versed in that. I am going to let Jim address that if he would, please.
 
 
Jim Roberts -
Foundation Coal - Chairman & CEO
Both Alpha and Foundation have been very, very active on the political front in trying to shape what we see coming at us and the climate change legislation that eventually will occur. I think one of the strategic rationales for merging the companies was certainly scale. I think that  I am sure that the combination of our two companies does make us a larger force with I would think additional influence.
With regard to the issue on coal and its future, I think we stated in our script we can't generate the energy we need without coal. There is going to be increased focus on renewables. We certainly see that in the news everyday, but the real action is going to be where it has always been and it is going to be at the level where coal produces over half the electricity in the country. And by everybody's estimate, that amount is going to increase over the next 20 years. In that respect, the merger of Alpha and Foundation I think is a positive thing that will help the industry going forward.

Hi, guys. Just had a quick question because I don't think you gave the details behind it. But one of the slides, I think it is slide 18, you gave your sort of management thoughts around 2010. I just was curious if you would be willing to give us a sense of some of the pricing assumptions around it.
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
I think the best thing we might do is refer you back to both companies' earnings calls. I think we gave our  both companies gave their committed and priced for 2010. At this stage, we would rather not give out our assumptions that we are making on our uncommitted tons. We are still in negotiations for a different variety of products. But I think you can take the two earnings calls of last week and probably see where our thinking is on the pricing.

Brian Gamble -
Simmons & Co. - Analyst
Good morning, guys. I was going to take the same route towards the guidance, but maybe I can restructure the question a little bit. Maybe over the last month, six weeks, could you give us your thoughts on how the met market has changed? Has it gotten better, has it gotten worse, what are you seeing from the steel side of things? And kind of your opinions on where that is likely to go as we go toward the back half of the year and into 10?
 
 
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Well, from 50,000 feet, it is probably a little bit better and that really singularly goes to the activity that continues to go on in China. We continue to get good news on the Chinese side in terms of their steel consumption. Their program is working over there. They are spending money to retrench their company and their infrastructure. So China is certainly a positive sign we see out there right now. I can't see that anything has particularly turned around, but it seemed somewhat stabilized at the current time. So positive in China and pretty stable. The inventories are a positive on the steel side. Again, there have been very good discipline on the steel side in terms of the products they have out there.
So we think that once this does turn, as we talked about in our earnings call, there isn't a great big overhang of steel product inventory out there either globally or in the United States. So it is not going down anymore, so maybe we have seen the bottom and we are going to see this thing turn around. It is just difficult to predict exactly when that might be. There is still some people talking we will see some positives in 09. I guess we collectively think probably we are at 10 seeing any real meaningful change in the metallurgical business.
Kevin Crutchfield -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
Brian, the other thing I would add to that is we are moving off of a pretty low bottom obviously, but there has been a lot of demand destruction obviously that everybody has talked about, but there has been also a lot of supply destruction as well, a lot of net assets shut in. There have been four international sales of met properties to international companies. And when this thing does begin to move, I think you could see a constraint perhaps even more exacerbated than we saw the last time through. And perhaps it happens even faster just because of the supply side destruction that has occurred through this downturn. So I mean that is one of the reasons we are pretty optimistic we are going to see some strengthening as we go forward.
Brian Gamble -
Simmons & Co. - Analyst
Kevin, do you care to take a swag at what you think that supply destruction was just given the sales and potentially some lower quality stuff coming off in Central App because it is uneconomic? Any idea on a tonnage basis?
Kevin Crutchfield -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - President
Yes, look, I mean the estimate has been all over the board, but clearly the four sales that have occurred represent several million tons in their own right. And then the destruction that has occurred across the US, I think  I think we talked about that in our last earnings release. I think maybe we talked about it on a global basis. I mean it was a fair amount of demand destruction. I think it was 50 million tons or so on a global basis.
Brian Gamble -

Just a question for you guys. I will let you digest this merger. Have you guys thought about or looked at or potentially in the future looked overseas?
 
 
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, we have. I am not sure Jim can answer that on Foundation. Again, because of Kevin and my backgrounds, we've both spent extensive time in Australia. That is certainly a country that is attractive to us. If an opportunity were to come along, it is certainly something that maybe is not the most active in terms of where we spend M&A time, but it is something we stay very close to and involved in. With our background coming from AMCI, we had, at those times, investments not only in Australia, but also in China and we are actively looking in other parts of the world.
I think just from our own philosophy, we like, when we look internationally, the more politically stable countries and some of the others, but it is not off of the radar screen at all to think that there is an international opportunity in our future. Jim, do you want to ?
Jim Roberts -
Foundation Coal - Chairman & CEO
Well, the international arena was not something that we excluded from our M&A activities, but it was certainly not an area that we focused on. We looked more internal to capitalize more on and reinforce what we do best, which was right here in the United States. But certainly we have internal human resources that have experience on the international market, but it was not a high focal area for us over the past few years.
David Lipschitz -
CLSA - Analyst
Just to follow up on that. If you were, like I said, down the road, next two, three, five years, whatever the case may be, to do something overseas, would you want to own it outright or would you want to be like a joint venture or a partial stake or how would you look at it that way?
Mike Quillen -
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
That's totally open. I think  again, being familiar with the Australia situation, that is normally a combination of owners in Australia is just the way most of the deals in Australia are structured except the very large ones like the BHP and the Rio. So you just have to go  it is a little bit different in every country on how those are structured, so I couldn't speculate on what we would prefer. We would just have to look at the deal and see whether it makes sense for our shareholders or not.

Exhibit 99.4
 
Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. (Foundation) and Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (Alpha) today announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which the two companies will combine in an all-stock transaction that provides Foundation shareholders a significant premium and creates America's third largest coal company with a combined enterprise value of $4.0 billion.
Alpha is a leading Eastern coal producer and the nation's largest supplier of metallurgical coal, operating 50 mines and 10 coal preparation plants in four states: Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Joining forces with Foundation's operations in Northern Appalachia, Central Appalachia, and the Powder River Basin, the combined company will be a leader in the coal industry with 59 mines, the most expansive geographic footprint in the United States, reserves of more than 2.3 billion tons of coal, and an attractive growth profile. The merged company's increased scale of operations, management depth, highly talented workforce, strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capability will provide an enhanced platform to compete successfully in today's business environment and capitalize on future growth in coal demand.
I believe that today's announcement is truly transformational for both companies and represents an excellent cultural match. Foundation and Alpha share essential values, including a strong commitment to our employees, a collaborative work environment, and a dedication to "do the right thing", acting at all times in an ethical manner. Employees can expect the same spirit of mutual respect we have come to appreciate at Foundation. The combined company will also provide a more secure and successful future. With one of the industry's strongest balance sheets and credit profiles, our new company will be well situated to invest in our future growth, providing additional opportunities for our employees, and benefiting all of our stakeholders. I am excited about our future prospects and ask that all employees join me in embracing this change as a positive and monumental step forward for our organization.
Corporate Structure and Management
Upon completion of the merger, Michael J. Quillen, Alpha's Chairman and CEO, will be appointed Chairman of the combined company and Kevin S. Crutchfield, currently Alpha's President, will be named Chief Executive Officer. Kurt Kost, Foundation's current President and Chief Operating Officer, will be President of the combined company. Once the merger has been completed, I plan to serve as a member of the board of directors. The combined company's board of directors will consist of six directors from Alpha and four directors from Foundation.
The combined company will retain the Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. name and will be headquartered in Abingdon, Va. Foundation's Baltimore corporate office will remain open for a minimum of 18 months as details of the integration are worked out.
Terms of the Transaction
Under the terms of the merger agreement, for each share of Foundation shareholders will receive 1.084 shares in the surviving company and each share of Alpha will automatically become a share of the combined company. Based on the closing price of Alpha on May 8, 2009, consideration received by the Foundation shareholders is valued at $32.73 per share. This will result in Foundation's shareholders owning approximately 41 percent of the combined company. The exchange ratio is calculated as a 37% premium over the 5-day average closing price of Foundation shares ending May 8
th
, 2009 relative to the 5-day average closing price of Alpha shares during the same period.
Next Steps of the Process
The boards of directors of Foundation and Alpha have each approved the terms of the merger agreement and have recommended that their shareholders approve the transaction. The merger is subject to the approval of each company's shareholders and other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. It is expected that the transaction will be completed later this year.
Employee informational meetings will be scheduled in most locations where you will have a chance to ask questions. Please direct any additional questions you have concerning this announcement to your human resources representative.
Until the merger is finalized, both organizations are separate and Foundation Coal affiliates will run their business just as they do today. The details of the merger and its impact on members of the workforce will take some time to work through completely, but we are committed to bringing the two organizations together in as seamless a way as possible. In the meantime, it is important that we continue to focus on conducting our daily jobs and provide a quality product to our customers in a safe and cost-effective manner. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this time of change.
