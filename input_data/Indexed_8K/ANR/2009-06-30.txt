Item 8.01. Other Events.
On June 24, 2009, the registration statement on Form S-4 (the "Registration Statement") of Foundation Coal Holdings, Inc. ("Foundation") was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On June 25, 2009, a complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of the State of Maryland for Anne Arundel County by Ascot Associates, an entity identifying itself as a stockholder of Foundation purporting to represent a class of all Foundation stockholders other than defendants and their affiliates. The lawsuit names Foundation as a nominal defendant and names Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. ("Alpha") and all of the members of Foundation's board of directors as defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Foundation and its directors breached their fiduciary duties to Foundation's stockholders and that certain disclosures in the Registration Statement are misleading and/or incomplete. In addition, the complaint alleges that Alpha aided and abetted Foundation's directors in the breach of their fiduciary duties to Foundation stockholders and alleges that the defendants conspired to commit tortious acts. The litigation seeks, among other things, injunctive relief, class action status, compensatory and/or rescissory damages and attorney's fees and costs in an amount to be determined at trial.
Alpha and Foundation believe that the complaint is without merit.
The information filed under this Form 8-K shall be deemed incorporated by reference into the joint proxy statement/prospectus that is included in the Registration Statement.
