FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR), a leading U.S. coal producer, reported a third quarter net loss of $19.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which includes the impact of various merger-related expenses, compared to net income of $67.4 million or $0.93 per diluted share last year.  The third quarter 2009 loss from continuing operations was $20.0 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $66.1 million or $0.91 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008.  Excluding merger-related expenses and other unusual items, third quarter 2009 adjusted income from continuing operations was $49.4 million, or $0.47 per diluted share.
ABINGDON, Va., November 3, 2009
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations for the quarter just ended totaled $112.6 million, compared to $122.3 million in the year ago period.  Excluding merger-related expenses and other unusual items, third quarter 2009 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $160.7 million.
For the quarter, the Company incurred merger-related expenses and other unusual items, including $42.4 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses, a net $58.0 million pre-tax expense for amortization of acquired coal supply agreements, a $23.5 million pre-tax non-cash charge arising from the termination of hedge accounting for an interest rate swap, a $5.6 million pre-tax expense for loss on the early extinguishment of debt, and a $22.2 million benefit arising from the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance.  The following table compares the Companys third quarter 2009 results from continuing operations as reported with the Companys results from continuing operations excluding these merger-related expenses and other unusual items.
Reported financial results for the third quarter of 2009 include three months of results from Alphas pre-merger operations (Alpha stand-alone) and two months of results from the acquired Foundation operations.  As a result of the timing of the closing of the Alpha/Foundation merger on July 31, 2009, third quarter 2009 results will not be comparable to historical or future periods.

hird Quarter 2009 Results
All quarters have been adjusted for discontinued operations and the third quarter 2008 amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of ASC 470-20 on January 1, 2009.  Coal revenues and coal margin per ton for all periods have been adjusted to reflect a change in the income statement presentation of gains and losses on derivatives.
*These are non-GAAP financial measures provided as additional relevant information about the Companys performance.  Management believes that adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted income from continuing operations per share are more representative of the Companys performance trends and enhance comparability to peer companies, and are, therefore, useful to investors.  A reconciliation of adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations to income from continuing operations, and a reconciliation of both EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to income from continuing operations are included in tables accompanying the financial schedules.
Alphas strong third quarter 2009 performance is particularly noteworthy in light of the continued weakness in the domestic thermal coal market and the fact that we closed our merger with Foundation Coal at the end of July, creating the third largest U.S. coal company by most measurements, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas Chief Executive Officer.  The ability to deliver strong quarterly results, exclusive of merger-related and other unusual items, is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire workforce which is now 6,200 strong.  I am pleased to report that Alphas new and significantly increased scale has not altered our focus on safety.  Both organizations were on pace for record safety performance prior to the merger, and the favorable trend continues.  During the quarter Eagle Butte celebrated two years without a lost time accident representing more than one million man hours, and Belle Ayr recently celebrated one year without a lost time accident representing approximately 800,000 man hours.
 
coal appears to have picked up markedly, discussions with metallurgical coal customers have increased, and order flow is beginning to result from this heightened activity.  Accordingly, we are increasing our guidance for metallurgical coal shipments in 2010 to a range of 10 to 12 million tons, a one million ton increase from the previous guidance range of 9 to 11 million tons.  As the largest U.S. supplier of metallurgical coal, Alpha remains highly leveraged to this market, and with 54% of our metallurgical coal uncommitted for 2010, we believe current market developments position Alpha favorably to capitalize on this opportunity.
We will continue to pursue a pragmatic and restrained approach to production in the current market environment in which decreased coal-fired generation and high utility inventories have significantly reduced demand for thermal coal.  However, Mr. Crutchfield continued, in the last few months interest in metallurgical

Finally, I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the success of our merger with Foundation Coal early in the third quarter.  We were able to close the transaction in just two and a half months, while at the same time putting together a detailed plan for integration which will serve as a model for Alpha as we execute our growth strategy in the future.  Since closing, we succeeded in our goal of finalizing the integration decision making process by the end of September; the management team is in place; and, we are positioned to execute as a unified company from this point forward.  
Financial Performance  Third Quarter
Total costs and expenses in the third quarter include $42.4 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses, including direct transaction costs, consulting and professional services fees, stock-based compensation charges, integration-related expenses, severance and relocation-related costs.  These merger-related expenses are primarily reflected in higher selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A), which was $83.5 million in the most recent quarter, versus $20.9 million for Alpha stand-alone in the third quarter of 2008.  In addition, a net $58.0 million pre-tax expense for amortization of acquired coal supply agreements was recorded in the third quarter due to acquisition accounting rules which required the Company to record Foundations coal contracts at fair value as of the acquisition date.  The resulting net intangible asset of $494.3 million as of July 31, 2009 will be amortized and expensed as the contracted tons of coal are shipped. This non-cash amortization will continue for several quarters, with the impact diminishing over time as the underlying coal supply agreements are fulfilled.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operations (including discontinued operations) for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 was $104.5 million, compared with $156.4 million in the third quarter of 2008.  Cash from operations (including discontinued operations) through the first three quarters of 2009 was $162.1 million, compared with $335.8 million for the first nine months of 2008.
Through the third quarter of 2009 Alpha continued to limit capital expenditures to match reduced production levels in light of reduced coal demand in the current market environment.  Capital expenditures (including discontinued operations) for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009 were $56.7 million and $102.8 million, respectively, versus $39.4 million and $113.6 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008.
The Company had available liquidity of $954.5 million as of September 30, 2009, including cash and cash equivalents of $481.6 million and $472.9 million available under the Companys revolving credit facility. Total debt outstanding at September 30, 2009 of $791.9 million includes the addition of $590.7 million of debt from the Foundation merger, partially offset by the repayment of Alphas $233.1 million Term Loan and a quarterly $8.4 million principal repayment on former Foundations Term Loan, and compares with total debt of $451.3 million at December 31, 2008.  
Market Overview
The third quarter of 2009 saw continued weakness in the thermal coal market in the United States where reduced industrial demand, milder-than-normal weather in coal-reliant regions, and low-cost natural gas combined to significantly reduce coal consumption.  For the first nine months of 2009, coal-fired electric generation was down approximately 10 percent compared to the same period in 2008, while overall electricity generation was down an estimated four percent.  In this recession-driven market environment, utility inventories are near record highs, ending September 2009 above 190 million tons nationwide.  However, the outlook is improving, and Alpha believes the following factors lead to the conclusion that the thermal coal market in the United States is likely to strengthen by the second half of 2010:

The market for metallurgical coal is currently strengthening around the world.  Three major factors account for the improving market for metallurgical coal.  They are Chinese demand, global economic improvements and supply constraints.  
Growing Asian demand for metallurgical coal, primarily from China, is causing a transformational change in the seaborne metallurgical coal market.  China is on pace to import more than 30 million tons of coking coal in 2009, representing greater than 10 percent of global seaborne coking coal, and the trend appears likely to continue.  Chinese demand for imported coking coal will primarily be satisfied with Australian exports, reducing the seaborne supply of Australian metallurgical coal available in the Atlantic basin.
As the world recovers from the recent recession, analysts forecast increasing steel production in 2010 worldwide.  Steel makers in the United States responded swiftly to the economic downturn, reducing capacity utilization and driving inventories to 26-years lows, despite anemic demand.  Though relatively slow to recover, capacity utilization in the U.S. has been steadily increasing recently and crested the 60% level in October after averaging below 45% in the first half of 2009, and capacity utilization is expected to rise going forward, which would drive the demand for metallurgical coal.  
As demand from China and around the world strengthens, met coal supplies remain constrained.  The global supply of coking coal is limited, and significant new mine developments are years away from completion and hampered by lack of available rail and port infrastructure.  Australia is currently near its maximum export capacity, as evidenced by queues of approximately 70 vessels awaiting loadings at Dalrymple Bay.  The Eastern United States is one of the only regions in the world that has spare capacity and can increase coking coal production and exportation to meet the anticipated growth in global demand.
As a result of the factors outlined above, customers have recently begun to express increasing interest in securing supplies of coking coal to meet their anticipated needs.  This level of customer interest stands in stark contrast to the relative lack of activity that marked Alphas second quarter 2009.  As the largest U.S. supplier of metallurgical coal, Alpha is highly leveraged to the global metallurgical coal market, and is favorably positioned to benefit from the likely strengthening of worldwide demand for coking coal.
Outlook
Alpha is fully committed and priced for the balance of 2009, and based on the midpoint of the Companys shipment guidance range nearly 90% of Alphas 2010 expected shipments are committed for delivery, with 80% committed and priced.  Based on strengthening metallurgical coal fundamentals and recent customer activity, Alpha is increasing its 2010 shipment guidance for metallurgical coal from a range of 9-11 million tons to a range of 10-12 million tons.  Management believes average per ton realizations for metallurgical coal are likely to rise in the current environment, and with approximately 54% of 2010 met coal shipments uncommitted and only 19% committed and priced, Alpha is well positioned to benefit from this strengthening market.  
Alpha proactively adjusted production levels in 2009 to match demand levels by reducing overtime, taking shifts out, selectively closing higher-cost mines, and cutting back on contractor production.  As the markets for metallurgical and later thermal coal improve, Alpha stands ready to ramp production to meet demand as necessary, and as a combined company following the recent merger Alpha has the capacity to produce greater than 90 million tons annually.
