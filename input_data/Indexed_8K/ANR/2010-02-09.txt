Alpha again delivered solid operating results in the fourth quarter of 2009, and our performance would have been even better had we not experienced severe winter weather in December that temporarily interrupted production and shipments at many of our operations, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer.  More than six months have passed since we completed our merger with Foundation Coal, and the integrated company has consistently delivered strong operating and financial results.  We remain focused on execution and operational excellence, and our consistent performance to date demonstrates the benefit of Alphas enhanced scale and diversification.  Our safety performance during 2009 was commendable, with a record low total reportable incident rate that was well below the industry average.  Alphas success directly reflects the dedication, focus and hard work of our entire workforce, and I would like to thank them for their continued efforts.
.  In response to this increasing demand, we are raising our guidance for metallurgical coal shipments in 2010 to a new range of 11 million tons to 13 million tons.  As the largest U.S. supplier of metallurgical coal, Alpha remains highly leveraged to this market with 38% of our planned 2010 metallurgical coal shipments yet to be priced.  Combined with our expertise in blending and optimization and our ample port capacity including 41% ownership of the DTA terminal, we are well-positioned to benefit from the current momentum in the global metallurgical coal market.  With regard to thermal coal, w
Demand for metallurgical coal appears to be increasing; customer discussions are ongoing; and recent indications suggest that the strength is likely to continue throughout 2010
e will continue to scale our production to respond to anticipated demand, and we have adjusted our Eastern thermal shipment guidance to a range of 23 million tons to 26 million tons.
Mr. Crutchfield continued, Last week Alpha entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Rice Energy, LP through which we are beginning to develop our valuable Marcellus shale gas resource in southwestern Pennsylvania where we control nearly 20,000 acres of one of the Marcellus most productive regions.  The initial phase of development is underway, and we are currently drilling the first of four wells planned for 2010.  Rice Energy brings technical and managerial expertise with extensive experience drilling and fracturing wells in the Marcellus, and this partnership enables Alpha to capture value from our Marcellus shale asset without diverting focus away from our coal business.
We remain on track to achieve the synergies that we laid out at the end of July.  Much of the anticipated synergies were expected to stem from blending and optimization, particularly for metallurgical products and export shipments.  In light of increasing global demand for metallurgical coal, these marketing synergies have the potential to exceed our initial estimates in 2010.  Going forward, we are intensely focused on delivering the consistent execution made possible by Alphas post-merger base of operations, which is arguably the most diverse of any domestic coal
producer, Mr. Crutchfield concluded.
Financial Performance  Fourth Quarter
The fourth quarter of 2009 is the first reporting period that includes a full three months of results from the former Foundation operations, compared to the third quarter of 2009 which included just two months of Foundation results.  Fourth quarter results are not comparable to Alpha stand-alone results reported for the year-ago period.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, Alpha shipped 12.1 million tons of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal, 6.6 million tons of Eastern steam coal and 2.6 million tons of metallurgical coal.  Average per ton realization for PRB shipments rose sequentially to $10.52 compared with $10.39 in the previous quarter. The average realization per ton for Eastern steam coal shipments was $62.57, down from $64.43 in the third quarter of 2009, and the average per ton realization for metallurgical coal was $97.18 in the fourth quarter compared with $96.94 in the previous quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter 2009 was $52.8 million and included $12.4 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses attributable to consulting and professional services fees, integration-related expenses, and severance and relocation-related costs.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) during the quarter was $97.6 million, and amortization of coal supply agreements resulting from the Foundation merger was $69.6 million during the quarter, up from $58.0 million in the previous quarter, reflecting the inclusion of a full three months of former Foundation Coal results in the fourth quarter.

Full Year 2009
Results
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operations (including discontinued operations) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 was $194.1 million, compared with $122.3 million for Alpha stand-alone in the fourth quarter of 2008. Cash provided by operations (including discontinued operations) for the full year 2009 was $356.2 million, compared with $458.0 million in 2008.
Capital expenditures (including discontinued operations) for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 were $84.3 million and $187.1 million, respectively, versus $24.1 million and $137.8 million in the comparable periods of 2008.
The company had available liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion as of year-end 2009, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $584.0 million and $536.0 million available under the companys revolving credit and accounts receivable securitization facilities. Total long-term debt and note payable outstanding at December 31, 2009 was $790.3 million, compared with $451.3 million at December 31, 2008.  
Market Overview
Coal-fired generation of electricity declined by greater than 10% in 2009, an unprecedented drop driven by a host of variables, including a severe economic recession and fuel switching resulting from low-cost natural gas.  Despite reduced coal production, which fell an estimated 100 million tons in 2009, utility inventories were persistently high and were estimated to exceed 200 million tons nationwide at the end of November.  In that environment, demand for thermal coal waned and pricing was under considerable downward pressure.

As 2010 begins, prospects for the thermal coal market have begun to improve.  A prolonged period of severe winter weather throughout much of the United States increased electricity generation while at the same time interrupting coal production and transportation logistics.  According to Genscape, the result was an approximately 30 million ton decline in nationwide utility inventories in December and January.  This would suggest that utility inventories are now roughly 170-175 million tons.  Relative to conditions in 2009, economic recovery is widely anticipated in 2010 which should lead to increased electricity generation, particularly in heavily industrialized regions of the country that rely on low-cost, coal-fired electricity.  The increased price of natural gas also suggests that much of the fuel switching observed last year is likely to reverse.  In addition, further coal production cutbacks appear probable in 2010 driven by the roll-off of higher priced legacy contracts.  In light of these trends, utility inventories are anticipated to return to more normal levels by the second half of 2010.  This market improvement is reflected in thermal coal spot prices which have increased recently and in coal futures prices which point to rising prices for the foreseeable future.
Demand for metallurgical coal has strengthened worldwide.  Faced with a global recession in 2009, the primary source of demand growth for metallurgical coal throughout much of the year was China, which became a net importer of coal for the first time and imported more than 30 million tons of metallurgical coal, or approximately 15% of the worlds seaborne supply.  By year-end, demand for metallurgical coal elsewhere in the world had begun to recover as U.S. steel-making capacity utilization rose above 60% from a low in the 30s, and Europe exhibited a similar trend.  Currently worldwide steel production is estimated to be on an annual pace of approximately 1.3 billion tons, with over 600 million tons expected from China alone in 2010.  
Because the Asian market requires increasing volumes of seaborne metallurgical coal, less supply will be available to satisfy demand as steel production and coking coal consumption increases in the United States, Europe, Brazil and elsewhere.  This shift of seaborne coking coal supply towards Asia should provide a significant opportunity for Appalachian producers, including Alpha, to benefit from a strengthening market in the Atlantic basin, in addition to allowing domestic producers to opportunistically ship directly into Asian markets.  As the largest supplier of metallurgical coal in the United States, and with substantial export terminal capacity, Alpha is uniquely positioned to benefit directly from the increasingly favorable conditions in the metallurgical coal market.
Outlook
Alpha remains committed to managing production to match customer demand.  Accordingly, Alpha has increased its 2010 shipment guidance range for metallurgical coal by one million tons to a range of 11-13 million tons, up from the previous range of 10-12 million tons.  Likewise, Alpha is adjusting its Eastern steam coal shipment guidance to a range of 23-26 million tons in order to match production with expected demand.  In the West, 2010 shipment guidance remains unchanged as Alpha has committed and priced approximately 100% of anticipated shipments.  
Cost of coal sales per ton in 2010 are currently anticipated to range from $8.30 to $8.90 in the West and from $54.00 to $57.00 in the East.  Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to range between $150 million and $165 million, reflecting modest inflation and the gradual ramp up in synergistic savings which should be most evident in the second half of 2010.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is estimated to range from $370 million to $390 million in 2010, and financial reporting interest expense is estimated to range from $70 million to $80 million.  Capital expenditures for the full year 2010 are anticipated to range from $340 million to $390 million, and include the annual bonus bid payment of the Eagle Butte LBA, provisions for growth capital associated with the Marcellus shale gas development joint venture, development of Deep Mine 41 which is anticipated to achieve full production in 2011, and sustaining capital for Alphas existing coal mining and coalbed methane operations.

Alpha is also establishing volume guidance for 2011.  PRB shipments in 2011 are expected to range from 48 million tons to 52 million tons, with 77% committed and priced at prices $1.00 greater than the average realizations embedded in the 2010 committed and priced volumes.  Eastern steam coal shipments in 2011 are expected to range from 23 million tons to 28 million tons, with 44% committed and priced and 26% committed and un-priced.  Eastern metallurgical coal shipments in 2011 are expected to range from 11 million tons to 14 million tons, with 15% committed and priced and 47% committed and un-priced.
