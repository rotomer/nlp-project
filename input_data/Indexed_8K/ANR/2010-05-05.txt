In recognition of the recent tragedy in West Virginia, on behalf of myself and the entire Alpha workforce, I would like to express condolences to all those affected.  I would also like to thank the individuals on Alphas mine rescue teams that responded heroically in the aftermath of the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer.  This sobering event reminds us that there is nothing more important than the safety of our miners, and we continue to maintain the utmost focus on Alphas safety performance.  With that in mind, I want to commend our workforce for Alphas excellent safety record.  During the first quarter, Alphas operations received six Mountaineer Guardian Awards, and the Barton B. Lay, Jr. Milestones of Safety Award, West Virginias most prestigious safety award.
Turning to Alphas financial results, I am pleased to report that Alpha generated record EBITDA from Continuing Operations of $218 million during the first quarter of 2010.   The strong performance during the quarter highlights the value of our regional diversification which enabled us to deliver excellent results despite adverse weather conditions in the East, and underscores both the importance of our position as the leading supplier of metallurgical coal and the profitability of our Pittsburgh #8 longwall mines that contributed over $100 million of coal margin during the quarter.  In April, we announced that Alphas secured credit facility had been amended, extended and increased.  Through the increased credit facility and additional free cash flow generation, Alphas liq uidity now stands at greater than $1.5 billion, a position that affords us significant financial flexibility as we plan for Alphas future growth.
Financial Performance
During the first quarter Alpha shipped 12.2 million tons of PRB coal, 6.5 million tons of Eastern steam coal and 2.6 million tons of metallurgical coal.  Average per ton realization for PRB shipments rose sequentially to $10.81 compared with $10.52 in the previous quarter.  The average realization per ton for Eastern steam coal shipments was $67.40, up eight percent from $62.57 in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the average per ton realization for metallurgical coal increased to $98.70 in the first quarter compared with $97.18 in the previous quarter.

Selling, general and administrative expense in the first quarter 2010 was $47.8 million and included $4.2 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses attributable to professional services fees, integration-related expenses, and severance and relocation-related costs.  This compares with selling, general and administrative expense of $52.8 million in the previous quarter, which included $12.4 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) during the quarter was $95.1 million, and amortization of acquired coal supply agreements resulting from the Foundation merger was $66.0 million.  
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operations (including discontinued operations) for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $143.3 million compared with $43.8 million for Alpha stand-alone in the first quarter of 2009.
Capital expenditures (including discontinued operations) for the first quarter 2010 were $60.9 million, versus $18.1 million in the comparable period of 2009.
The company had available liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of an aggregate $651.2 million plus $556.4 million available under the companys revolving credit facility.  After the end of the quarter, Alpha announced that its secured credit facility had been amended, extended and increased, bringing total liquidity to approximately $1.5 billion with no significant debt maturities until the third quarter of 2014.  Total long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt at March 31, 2010, was $785.1 million compared with $790.3 million at December 31, 2009.

Market Overview
After U.S. utility inventories crested at record high levels of over 200 million tons in November 2009, stockpiles fell by approximately 40 million tons to roughly 165 million tons at the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The sharp reduction in utility inventories was attributable to a combination of factors, including economic recovery, severe winter weather, higher natural gas pricing during the winter heating season, and lower coal production levels.  In light of the rapid inventory decrease and sustained production cutbacks, U.S. inventories are expected to return to normal levels of 140 million tons to 150 million tons during the second half of 2010.
Asian demand for seaborne thermal coal is increasing rapidly.  Shipments out of South Africas Richards Bay terminal to India and China have grown to 42 percent in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 25 percent in the first quarter of 2009.  India continues to increase coal imports which are projected to exceed 100 million metric tonnes in the next few years compared to approximately 70 million metric tonnes in 2009, and India currently has more than 75GW of new coal-fired generation under construction.  Chinese thermal imports during the first quarter were on an annual pace for 127 million metric tonnes compared to actual thermal imports of 88 million metric tonnes during 2009.  As seaborne thermal coal increasingly moves into the Asian markets, less seaborne supply will be available t o satisfy demand in the Atlantic basin, which should create additional opportunities for U.S. exports in the coming quarters.
The global market for metallurgical coal continues to strengthen as steel production increases worldwide.  Chinese steel production in recent months suggests that China could produce between 630 million tonnes and 650 million tonnes of steel in 2010, up from approximately 570 million tonnes produced in 2009.  Global steel production increased 27 percent and U.S. steel production increased 52 percent during the first two months of 2010, compared to the comparable period of 2009.  U.S. steel production capacity utilization continues to increase and is now above 70 percent, compared to lows in the mid-30s in early 2009.  Adding to the tight supply of met coal worldwide, recent weather events in Australia further limited seaborne exports.  In this environment of increasing demand and limi ted supply, spot prices have continued to lift, reportedly reaching $240-250 per metric tonne on an FOBT basis for the highest quality metallurgical coal.
As the leading U.S. supplier of metallurgical coal and a leading, regionally diversified producer of U.S. thermal coal with 13-15 million tons of U.S. export terminal capacity, Alpha is positioned to benefit from the strengthening global markets for metallurgical and thermal coal.  The prospect of an improving U.S. market for thermal coal should provide opportunities for Alpha to leverage its low-cost production from the longwall operations in Pennsylvania and from the Powder River Basin.  With additional productive capacity in all active operating regions, Alpha stands ready to address any increase in demand as market conditions warrant.  
Outlook
Alpha is maintaining its previous guidance for 2010 and 2011 shipment volumes of Eastern metallurgical coal, Eastern steam coal and Western steam coal.  Alpha is also maintaining its previous guidance for Eastern and Western cost of coal sales per ton; selling, general and administrative expense, depletion, depreciation and amortization expense; interest expense; and capital expenditures for 2010.

Alpha is positioned to benefit from significant leverage to the strengthening metallurgical coal market with 81 percent of the midpoint of its anticipated 2011 Eastern metallurgical coal shipments unpriced as of April 21, 2010.  As of April 21, 2010, Alpha had 85 percent and 19 percent of the midpoint its 2010 and 2011 shipment guidance ranges for Eastern metallurgical coal committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $110.60 and $122.56, respectively.  Alpha continues to match thermal coal shipments to anticipated demand, with 100 percent of the midpoint of 2010 Western steam coal shipment guidance committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $10.97 and 95 percent of the midpoint of 2010 Eastern steam coal shipment guidance committed and priced at projected average per to n realizations of $65.76.  For 2011, Alpha had 83 percent of the midpoint of Western steam coal shipment guidance committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $11.89 and 53 percent of the midpoint of Eastern steam coal shipment guidance committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $66.95.
