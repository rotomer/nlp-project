Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR), a leading U.S. coal producer, reported second quarter net income of $38.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to net income of $15.4 million or $0.22 per diluted share last year.  The second quarter 2010 income from continuing operations was $39.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $16.7 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.  Excluding amortization of coal supply agreements, merger-related expenses and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, second quarter 2010 adjusted income from continuing operations was $75.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share.
ABINGDON, Va., August 4, 2010
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations for the second quarter 2010 was $198.6 million, compared to $68.2 million in the year ago period.  Excluding merger-related expenses and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, second quarter 2010 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $202.1 million.  
Coal revenues and coal margin per ton for 2009 have been adjusted to reflect a change in the income statement presentation of gains and losses on derivatives. 
*These are non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of adjusted income  from continuing operations to income from continuing operations, and a reconciliation of both EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to income from continuing operations are included in tables accompanying the financial schedules.
 
 
 
 
 
Alpha continued to build on its strong track record of excellent safety performance during the second quarter, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer.  Two of our Pennsylvania operations, the Dora #8 mine and the Clymer Preparation Plant, received Joseph A. Holmes Safety Awards for 2009, and our entire Alpha Coal West operation, including both the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mines, experienced zero reportable accidents during the second quarter.  I want to personally commend all of the members of our workforce for their ongoing and consistent commitment to safety and our culture of Running Right. The impact of that commitment and the success of their efforts are clearly evident throughout our organization.
 
 
Amid a turbulent time in our industry with unprecedented regulatory challenges, a bumpy and gradual economic recovery and near-term weakening of metallurgical coal demand and pricing, Alpha once again delivered consistent results during the second quarter generating EBITDA from Continuing Operations of $199 million.  Our position as arguably the most diversified U.S. producer of coal serves us well in these rapidly changing markets.  During the second quarter, Alpha significantly increased its met coal shipments and realizations, largely offsetting the impact of a month-long longwall move at the Cumberland mine.  This compares to the previous quarter when the Pittsburgh #8 longwall mines in Pennsylvania contributed nearly half of Alphas EBITDA as met coal shipments were still ramping up. 60; Alpha continues to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow and, with total liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion, we believe we are well positioned to grow the company organically or through acquisitions in the future.  In my view, Alphas consistently solid performance following our merger, which reached its one-year anniversary just a few days ago, validates the success of our long-term strategy for growth and diversification.
While our focus on growth remains unchanged and continues to be our primary objective, we took advantage of what we believed were extremely attractive valuation levels in the U.S. coal sector during the second quarter and implemented our first-ever share repurchase program.  The Alpha board authorized share repurchases up to as much as $125 million, and during the second quarter Alpha repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of $36.32.  We will continue to seek opportunities to repurchase shares at attractive valuations pursuant to current and future Rule 10b5-1 plans and potentially from time to time at managements discretion.
Financial Performance
 
During the second quarter Alpha shipped 11.0 million tons of PRB coal, 5.9 million tons of Eastern steam coal and 3.3 million tons of metallurgical coal.  Average per ton realization for PRB shipments rose sequentially to $10.92 compared with $10.81 in the previous quarter.  The average realization per ton for Eastern steam coal shipments was $66.11, compared with $67.40 in the first quarter of 2010, and the average per ton realization for metallurgical coal increased to $117.61 in the second quarter compared with $98.70 in the previous quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the second quarter 2010 decreased $3.6 million sequentially to $44.2 million and included $2.1 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses attributable to professional services fees, integration-related expenses, and severance and relocation-related costs.  This compares with selling, general and administrative expense of $47.8 million in the previous quarter, which included $4.2 million of pre-tax merger-related expenses.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) during the quarter was $91.1 million, and amortization of acquired coal supply agreements resulting from the Foundation merger was $55.6 million.  
 
 
 
 
 
-Date Results
Year-to
During the first half of 2010 Alphas coal shipments totaled 41.6 million tons, including 31.9 million tons from the former Foundation operations, compared with 9.5 million tons in the first half of 2009 for Alpha stand-alone.  Metallurgical coal shipments were 5.9 million tons year-to-date, up 69 percent compared to the 3.5 million tons during the first six months of 2009.  Shipments of PRB coal and Eastern steam coal were 23.3 million tons and 12.4 million tons, respectively, during the first six months of 2010.    
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operations (including discontinued operations) for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 was $194.7 million compared with $13.8 million for Alpha stand-alone in the second quarter of 2009.
Capital expenditures (including discontinued operations) for the second quarter 2010 were $75.0 million, versus $28.0 million in the comparable period last year.  Investing activities during the second quarter included $36.1 million for the third of five annual installment payments pertaining to a federal coal lease in the PRB.
On April 15, 2010, Alpha announced that its secured credit facility had been amended, extended and increased by approximately $300 million to a total revolving credit facility of approximately $950 million.  Subsequently, Alpha terminated $96 million of the revolving credit facility and prepaid $39.6 million of its Term Loan A.   The termination and prepayment pertained to lenders that chose not to extend their commitments beyond the original expiration date of July 7, 2011.  At the end of the second quarter, Alpha had available liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of an aggregate $661.5 million plus $811.9 million available under the companys secured credit facility.  Total long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt at June 30, 2010, was $745.9 million compared with $790.3 million at December 31, 2009.  
 
 
 
Market Overview
Utility inventories in the U.S. are declining and now stand at approximately 160 million tons.  The decrease is attributable to several factors, including economic recovery, hot summer weather, reduced fuel switching relative to last year and decreased coal production.  Industrial power demand rose by greater than 9 percent year-over-year in the first half of 2010 and, in addition, season-to-date cooling degree days are up roughly 17% compared to last year.  As a result of these and other factors electricity generation year-to-date in 2010 has risen by an estimated 3 to 4 percent.  By comparison, coal-fired electricity generation has increased approximately 7 percent year-to-date, implying that some of the coal-to-gas switching that occurred in 2009 has reversed course.  Adding to the downward pressure on inventories, U.S. coal production in the first half of 2010 has decreased 1 to 2 percent year-over-year.  These factors have combined to reduce inventories by 40-50 million tons since peaking at a level above 200 million tons in November of 2009.  Inventories are expected to return to historically normal levels by the end of the year and should drive increased contracting in the second half of 2010.  The expected return to a more balanced market is reflected in the significant and fairly stable contango in the forward thermal coal prices for all producing regions.  
Seaborne demand for thermal coal continues to increase, driven primarily by increasing Chinese and Indian imports.  Chinas electricity consumption rose over 21 percent in the first half of 2010.  This growth is drawing increasingly on seaborne thermal coal with June imports on an annualized pace of 97 million metric tonnes, up from an annual pace of 76 million tonnes in May.  China is currently projected to import 90 to 100 million tonnes of thermal coal per year.  While growing off of a smaller base, India is likely to represent an even greater long-term growth opportunity for seaborne thermal than China due to the relatively lower quality of Indias indigenous reserves.  Indian imports are forecast to rise at approximately 10 percent annually and are projected to reach 100 million tonnes by the middle of the decade.  This rapid Asian demand growth for seaborne thermal coal is straining the export capacity of Indonesia and Australia which together account for approximately 50 percent of the worlds seaborne thermal supply.  To keep up with growing Asian demand, South African and Columbian coals that traditionally served the European market are increasingly moving into the Asian market, which should create an opportunity for U.S. exports into the Atlantic basin in the near future.  
Global demand for metallurgical coal remains strong despite cyclical challenges, including the near-term slowing of economic growth in China and uncertainties surrounding European economies.  Steel production is increasing globally and is primarily being driven by China.  Despite a widely anticipated slowdown in the second half of the year, China remains on track to produce roughly 620-630 million tonnes of steel, up approximately 10 percent from 570 million tonnes in 2009.  Chinese metallurgical coal imports have risen from nearly flat in 2008 to 34 million tonnes in 2009, and China is on pace to import more than 40 million tonnes in 2010.  While internal met coal resources can be developed and imports from Mongolia can be increased over time, China is likely to remain dependent on seaborne im ports of high quality metallurgical coal for the foreseeable future.  As with thermal coal, India may offer the more persistent long-term growth opportunity for seaborne metallurgical coals due to the absence of quality domestic reserves.   Indian imports totaled 28 million tonnes in 2009 but are projected to ramp steadily, nearing 50 million tonnes by 2015.  In this environment of growing metallurgical coal demand and limited sources of supply globally, prices have tested near-record levels.    
Alpha is well-positioned to benefit from the current trends, both in the U.S. market and the seaborne market.  When additional thermal coal demand materializes in the U.S., Alpha is ready and able to increase production to meet utility customers needs.  Assuming that the higher forward prices for U.S. thermal coals are achieved, Alpha is positioned to benefit from higher average realizations and enhanced margins in future periods.  With an industry-leading position in export terminal capacity and low-cost Pittsburgh #8 longwall production, Alpha is positioned to benefit from the opportunity to export thermal coal into the Atlantic Basin.  Finally, as the leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal in the United States, Alpha will continue to benefit from strong global demand and expected robust pricing for metallurgical coals.
 
 
 
Outlook
Alpha is maintaining its previous guidance for 2010 and 2011 shipment volumes of Eastern metallurgical coal, Eastern steam coal and Western steam coal.  Alpha is also maintaining its previous guidance for Eastern and Western cost of coal sales per ton; depletion, depreciation and amortization expense; interest expense; and capital expenditures for 2010.  The guidance for selling, general and administrative expense, excluding merger-related expenses, has been slightly increased to reflect updated estimates for incentive compensation and certain professional fees.
Alpha is positioned to benefit from significant leverage to the robust metallurgical coal market with 83 percent of the midpoint of its anticipated 2011 Eastern metallurgical coal shipments unpriced as of July 22, 2010.  As of July 22, 2010, Alpha had 94 percent and 17 percent of the midpoint of its 2010 and 2011 shipment guidance ranges for Eastern metallurgical coal committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $114.04 and $125.26, respectively.  Western steam coal shipments for 2010 were 100 percent committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $10.81 and 96 percent of 2010 Eastern steam coal shipments were committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $65.91, based on the midpoint of shipment guidance.  For 2011, Alpha had 94 percent of the midpoint of Western steam coal shipment guidance committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $11.81 and 62 percent of the midpoint of Eastern steam coal shipment guidance committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $67.89.
