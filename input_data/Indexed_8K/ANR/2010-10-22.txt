Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On October 19, 2010, Brooks Run Mining Company, LLC (Brooks Run), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that mining had advanced into unmapped old works at the Horse Creek No. 1 Mine.  The abandoned mine was inadvertently encountered due to its location being inaccurately shown on available maps of the old works, which were mined and mapped by a non-affiliated third party.  No injuries occurred and no harmful or hazardous conditions were encountered as a result of the event described in the order.  In response to the order, mine personnel completed the work the inspector requested and the order has been terminated.
