Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR), a leading U.S. coal producer, reported third quarter net income of $31.9 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $16.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share last year.  The third quarter 2010 income from continuing operations was $32.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to a loss from continuing operations of $16.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.  Excluding amortization of coal supply agreements and merger-related expenses, third quarter 2010 adjusted income from continuing operations was $70.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share.
ABINGDON, Va., November 3, 2010
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations for the third quarter 2010 was $197.3 million, compared to $117.9 million in the year ago period.  Excluding merger-related expenses, third quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $207.7 million.  
As a result of the timing of the closing of the Foundation merger on July 31, 2009, reported financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 included only two months of results from the acquired Foundation operations.  Thus, third quarter and nine month 2010 results are not comparable to third quarter and nine month 2009 results.
 
*These are non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of adjusted income  from continuing operations to income from continuing operations, and a reconciliation of both EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to income from continuing operations are included in tables accompanying the financial schedules.
 
 
 
 
In October we experienced a mine accident that resulted in the loss of a member of the Alpha family at our Kingston mine, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer.  This loss reminds us that the pursuit of safety is a journey without a destination and renews our commitment to ensure that every member of the Alpha team returns home safely every night.  We are proud of our operations and the safety awards received by our PRB and CAPP operations during the past quarter, but make no mistake, our ultimate goal is very basicto have an injury-free workplace.   To that end, our efforts continue.
 
Throughout 2010, weve continued to experience volatility in the coal markets.  Early in the year, the focus was on the strengthening metallurgical coal market.  By the second quarter the metallurgical market had softened a bit, although still strong by historical measures, and the focus had shifted to falling utility inventories and improving thermal prices.  Now just a few months later, the industry has come full circle.  The metallurgical market is again strengthening and low-priced natural gas is constraining domestic thermal coal prices, leading investors to take a renewed interest in metallurgical coal.  Throughout this cycle, Alpha has remained positioned to deliver consistent results.  Due to Alphas well-diversified asset base, we have consistentl y generated greater than $200 million of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in every quarter of 2010.  We remain the leading supplier of metallurgical coal in the United States; we benefit from our low-cost Pittsburgh #8 longwall operations; and we have operations in the Powder River Basin that offer significant leverage as Western thermal prices improve.  In my view, this combination, and the resulting consistency of results, is unique to Alpha and unmatched by any other domestic producer.
Alpha has consistently generated free cash flow throughout its history, and the third quarter was no exception.  By the end of the quarter, Alpha had increased its total liquidity to approximately $1.6 billion.  This affords Alpha tremendous financial flexibility, and we have consistently communicated to all of our stakeholders that we intend to use this flexibility to continue on a path of thoughtful and disciplined growth, with a focus on maximizing shareholder value and building upon our diverse and sustainable business model.  I believe the benefits of this approach are evident in the consistent results Alpha has delivered throughout 2010.
 
 
 
 
Financial Performance
During the third quarter Alpha shipped 12.3 million tons of PRB coal, 5.8 million tons of Eastern steam coal and 3.0 million tons of metallurgical coal.  Average per ton realization for PRB shipments rose sequentially to $11.10 compared to $10.92 in the previous quarter.  The per ton average realization for Eastern steam coal shipments rose to $67.72 compared to $66.11 in the second quarter of 2010, and the average per ton realization for metallurgical coal increased to $122.24 in the third quarter compared to $117.61 in the previous quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
-Date Results
Year-to
During the first three quarters of 2010 Alphas coal shipments totaled 62.7 million tons, including 48.0 million tons from the former Foundation operations, compared with 25.9 million tons in the first nine months of 2009, which included 11.7 tons from former Foundation operations during August and September of 2009.  Metallurgical coal shipments were 8.9 million tons year-to-date, up 59 percent compared to the 5.6 million tons during the first nine months of 2009.  Shipments of PRB coal and Eastern steam coal were 35.6 million tons and 18.2 million tons, respectively, during the first nine months of 2010.

Market Overview
Demand for metallurgical coal has begun to strengthen significantly in both the domestic and international markets.  Pricing for high quality metallurgical coals has been particularly strong in the United States as domestic steelmakers attempt to lock in their 2011 supply earlier in the season, more high quality coals appear poised for the export markets, and domestic supply is under pressure due to a combination of factors, including asset acquisitions by foreign entities, more challenging geology, regulatory pressures and the closure of a few key mines in the United States.  Alpha has benefited directly from the strength in the domestic market, locking in some contracts with U.S. steelmakers at prices that would equate to greater than the third quarter benchmark.  
Following a brief mid-year pause, Chinas steel production has resumed its growth, and year-to-date Chinese steel production is up approximately 15 percent.  Alpha estimates that Chinese metallurgical coal imports could exceed 40 million tons in 2010.  Globally, steel production is forecast to exceed 1.4 billion metric tonnes this year and is projected to increase going forward.  The seaborne metallurgical coal market is expected to grow by 10-15 percent in 2010 to approximately 260 million tons, and global steel consumption is expected to expand by as much as 30 percent by 2015, driven primarily by growth in China and India.  While demand shows no signs of abating, new sources of metallurgical coal supply in places such as Mozambique, Mongolia, and Siberia appear to be years away from pr oducing meaningful volumes, and Australia continues to struggle with infrastructure limitations that constrain export capacity.  In this environment, Alpha, as the leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal in the United States, is uniquely positioned to benefit from the fundamental strength in metallurgical coal demand with prices expected to remain at near-record levels for the foreseeable future.
Thermal coal fundamentals are also improving.  Utility inventories in the United States have decreased approximately 50 million tons from a record high one year ago and are now in the 150 million ton range nationwide.  Coal-fired electricity generation is up approximately 7 percent year-to-date compared to 2009.  By contrast, overall electricity generation has increased approximately 5 percent, indicating that coal has recaptured some market share lost to natural gas during 2009.  At the same time, domestic coal production is down approximately 1 percent year-to-date, led by Eastern production which has declined 2-3 percent compared to last year.  Offsetting the positive impact of increased demand, decreased supply and the resulting normalization of inventory levels, natural gas price s have fallen to approximately $3.50 to $4.00 per mcf, effectively constraining coal prices and driving a greater than normal increase in thermal coal stockpiles during the current shoulder season.  In this environment, Alpha is well positioned with all of its anticipated PRB production committed and priced for both the remainder of 2010 and all of 2011, and Alphas Eastern steam coal fully committed and priced in 2010 and 86 percent committed and priced in 2011 at attractive average per ton realizations.
Globally thermal coal demand is experiencing rapid growth and demand threatens to overwhelm supply in the intermediate term, creating a significant opportunity in the global seaborne market.  China is projected to import roughly 120 million metric tonnes of thermal coal in 2010, up approximately 20 percent from 2009.  Similarly, India is projected to increase thermal coal imports by nearly 30 percent in 2010.  Worldwide coal-fired electric generation is forecast to increase by over 380 gigawatts between 2010 and 2015, requiring approximately 1 billion incremental tons of thermal coal.  By 2030, coal-fired generation is expected to increase by over 1,000 gigawatts compared to 2010.  While growth in thermal coal consumption in the United States and other developed countries is likely to remain muted in the near-term and may decline over time, the global growth opportunity is significant for low-cost producers like Alpha that are able to access the seaborne markets.
As the leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal in the United States, Alpha benefits directly from the current and projected strength in the metallurgical coal market.  As a low-cost producer of Pittsburgh #8 coal and PRB coal, Alphas products can dispatch competitively into the domestic and seaborne thermal markets.  Alphas highly contracted thermal book of business in 2011 largely insulates Alpha from natural gas-driven pricing pressures currently facing the domestic market.  Long-term, Alpha plans to increase both its scale and diversification, further penetrating the global growth markets for both metallurgical and thermal coals.
Outlook
Alpha is fine tuning its guidance for 2010, updating 2011 shipment and average realization guidance, and establishing 2011 cost and capital expenditure guidance.  For the full year 2010 Alpha has narrowed the anticipated range of Eastern metallurgical coal shipments to 11.5 to 12.5 million tons compared to 11 to 13 million tons previously, while leaving the midpoint unchanged at 12 million tons.  Alpha currently expects Eastern steam coal shipments to range from 23.5 to 25 million tons, compared to previous guidance of 23 to 26 million tons.  Shipment guidance for the West remains unchanged at 47 to 50 million tons.  Based on the midpoint of shipment guidance, Alpha has 100 percent of its Eastern metallurgical, Eastern steam and Western coal committed and priced at expected average per ton real izations of $114.49, $66.34 and $10.88, respectively.  Cost of coal sales per ton in 2010 are expected to range from $57.00 to $58.50 in the East, and from $8.50 to $8.90 in the West.  Alphas anticipated full year 2010 SG&A and interest expenses remain unchanged from previous guidance.  DD&A is now expected to range between $370 and $380 million compared to previous guidance of $370 to $390 million, and capital expenditures are now expected to range from $325 to $350 million compared to previous guidance of $340 to $390 million.  
For 2011, Alpha has narrowed the anticipated range of metallurgical shipments to a range of 11.5 to 13.5 million tons, while leaving the midpoint unchanged at 12.5 million tons.  Eastern steam coal shipments are now anticipated to range from 23.0 to 26.0 million tons compared to the previous guidance range of 23.0 to 28.0 million tons.  Alpha is positioned to benefit from significant leverage to the robust metallurgical coal market in 2011 with 77 percent of the midpoint of its anticipated 2011 Eastern metallurgical coal shipments unpriced as of October 22, 2010.  As of that date, Alpha had 23 percent of the midpoint of its expected 2011 metallurgical shipments committed and priced at projected average per ton realizations of $138.82.  Based on the midpoint of shipment guidance, Western steam a nd Eastern steam coal shipments for 2011 were 100 percent and 86 percent committed and priced, respectively, at projected average per ton realizations of $11.82 and $65.54.  Alpha currently anticipates Eastern cost of coal sales per ton to range from $58.00 to $63.00 and Western cost of coal sales to range from $9.25 to $9.75 per ton.  Selling, general and administrative expense is expected to range from $160 to $170 million in 2011; DD&A expense is expected to be in the $380 to $400 million range; and interest expense is projected to range from $65 to $75 million.  Capital expenditures in 2011 are forecast to range from $340 million to $440 million.
