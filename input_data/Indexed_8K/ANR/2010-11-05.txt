Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in a Current Report on Form 8-K .
 
On November 2, 2010, AMFIRE Mining Company, LLC (AMFIRE), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that a roof bolter operator had been observed entering an area of unsupported roof at the Madison Mine.  No injuries occurred, no hazardous conditions were cited, and the order did not require withdrawal of miners from the mine.
 
AMFIRE has a safety policy which prohibits entry into areas of unsupported roof, and the company has received no prior citations or orders alleging that miners have entered such areas.  AMFIRE does not believe that the use of a 107(a) order was the appropriate response for an individual employees aberrant behavior and intends to challenge the order before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission.
 
In response to the order, mine personnel reviewed with the Madison Mine workforce AMFIREs policy which prohibits underground miners from entering areas of unsupported roof, and the order has been terminated.
