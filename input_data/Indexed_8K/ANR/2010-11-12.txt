Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
On November 9, 2010, Dickenson-Russell Coal Company, LLC (Dickenson-Russell), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that an area of the mine roof near the working face at the Cherokee Mine began to bump and was heard popping and cracking.  In response to the order, mine personnel were removed from the affected area, and numerous test holes were drilled.  No adverse conditions were found, no injuries occurred and it was determined that no imminent danger existed.
 
On November 10, 2010, MSHA determined that the order had been issued in error and vacated the order.
