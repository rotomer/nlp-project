Item 1.01.                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 28, 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Alpha), and Mountain Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha (Merger Sub), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Massey Energy Company, a Delaware corporation (Massey), providing for the acquisition of Massey by Alpha.   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of the respective parties, Massey will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the Merger), with Massey surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha.
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Massey common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares owned by (i) Alpha, Massey or Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries (which will be cancelled) or (ii) stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive 1.025 shares of Alpha common stock and $10.00 in cash, without interest (the Massey Merger Consideration).  No fractional shares of Alpha common stock will be issued in the Merger, and Masseys stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Massey common stock.  The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the me aning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Upon completion of the transaction, Alpha and Massey stockholders will own approximately 54% and 46% of the combined company, respectively.
 
All currently issued and outstanding options to purchase Massey common stock will vest and be converted into options to purchase Alpha common stock, with adjustments to reflect the Merger.  All currently issued and outstanding restricted shares of Massey common stock will vest and be converted into the right to receive the Massey Merger Consideration.  Other outstanding equity-based awards of Massey will be converted into the right to receive cash, with adjustments to reflect the Merger.  Any equity-based awards of Massey that are granted after January 28, 2011 but before the Effective Time shall be converted into equivalent Alpha awards, with adjustments to reflect the Merger, and will vest and, if applicable, be settled, in accordance with their original schedule.
 
The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the adoption by the Massey stockholders of the Merger Agreement and (ii) the approval by the Alpha stockholders of (x) an amendment to Alphas certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of Alpha common stock that Alpha is authorized to issue in order to permit issuance of the Alpha common stock in connection with the Merger and (y) the issuance of Alpha common stock in connection with the Merger.  In addition, the Merger is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, as well as other customary closing conditions.
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants, including covenants providing for each of the parties: (i) to conduct its operations in all material respects according to the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past practice during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger; (ii) to use reasonable best efforts to cause the transaction to be consummated; (iii) not to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage inquiries, proposals or offers relating to alternate transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto; and (iv) to call and hold a special stockholders meeting and, subject to certain exceptions, recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement, in the case of Massey, and amendment of the Alpha certificate of incorporation and issuance of Alpha common stock in connection with the Merger, in the case of Alpha.
 
The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights and provides that, (i) upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of Massey or termination of the Merger Agreement to enter into a written definitive agreement for a superior proposal, Massey will owe Alpha a cash termination fee of $251 million; (ii) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of Alpha or termination of the Merger Agreement to enter into a written definitive agreement for a superior proposal, Alpha will owe Massey a cash termination fee of $252 mi llion; and (iii) upon the termination of the Merger Agreement due to Alphas failure to obtain the required stockholder approval at the Alpha stockholders meeting in the absence of a competing proposal, Alpha will owe Massey a cash termination fee of $72 million.
 
Alpha has obtained $3.3 billion in committed financing from Morgan Stanley and Citi which, in addition to existing cash balances, will be sufficient to finance cash consideration to Massey stockholders and to refinance certain existing Alpha and Massey debt.  Morgan Stanley's and Citi's commitment to finance the Merger is subject to customary conditions precedent, including no "Company Material Adverse Effect" (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has occurred.  Alpha is obligated to pay a cash termination fee of $360 million to Massey if all the conditions to closing have been met and the Merger is not consummated because of a breach by Alphas lenders of their obligations to finance the transaction.

(1)         The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws.  Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.
(2)         The Board of Directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or any part of the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the declaration and payment of dividends.
(3)         The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not
 
 
 
 
 
the contract or act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interest, or for any other reason.
(4)         In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time made by the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such by-law had not been made.
SEVENTH:               Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity w hile serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
 
 
 
 
 
ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (1) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise.  The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.
(1) If a claim under the foregoing paragraph is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be
 
 
 
 
 
paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any  proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circ umstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(2) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
(3) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not
 
 
 
 
 
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
EIGHTH:                  Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, may, on the application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of credito rs, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs.  If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.
NINTH:                    The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power.
 
 
 
 
 
TENTH:                    To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
The undersigned, an officer of [Parent], a Delaware corporation (Parent), is making the representations in this letter on behalf of Parent in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [], 2011 (the Merger Agreement), among Parent, [Company], a Delaware corporation (Company) and [MOUNTAIN MERGER SUB, INC.], a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (MergerCo), and in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the registration statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement), each as amended or supplemented through the date hereof.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, MergerCo shall be merged with and into Company (the Merger) with Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  Alternatively, if the direction of the Merger is reversed pursuant to section 2.01(d) of the Merger Agreement (the Restructuring), Company shall be merged with and into MergerCo with MergerCo continuing as the surviving entity, which may be a limited liability company if Parent so elects (such entity, Surviving Entity).  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. All Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.
 
The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Parent as follows:
 
1.
 
The facts relating to the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Parent and its subsidiaries, true, correct and complete in all material respects.  The Merger will be consummated in
 
 
 
 
2
 
 accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Registration Statement.  Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement and the Registration Statement, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a) any of Parent, its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of Company, its affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger or otherwise.
 
2.
 
Unless a Restructuring occurs, shares of Company stock representing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Company stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of Company stock will be exchanged solely for Parent voting stock pursuant to the Merger.  For purposes of this representation, shares of Company stock exchanged for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Parent (including cash paid to dissenting stockholders) will be treated as outstanding Company stock on the Closing Date.
 
3.
 
At least 40 percent of the aggregate consideration received by Company shareholders in the Merger will be comprised of Parent common stock (based on the fair market value of Parent common stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed).  For purposes of this representation, the aggregate consideration shall include payments, if any, made to dissenters in connection with the Merger.
 
4.
 
Cash payments to be made to Company shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock that would otherwise be issued to such holders in the Merger will be made solely for the purpose of saving Parent the expense and inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Parent stock and will not represent separately bargained-for consideration.  To the knowledge of Parent, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Company shareholders.  No Company shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers, will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent stock.
 
5.
 
The fair market value of Parent stock and other consideration received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arms-length negotiations between the respective managements of Parent and Company.
 
6.
 
None of the Parent stock that will be received in connection with the Merger by any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the performance of any services.  The compensation paid to any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company will be for
 
 
 
 
3
 
services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be determined by bargaining at arms length.
 
7.
 
Except for expenses directly related to the Merger within the guidelines set forth in Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187, (i) Parent, MergerCo, Company and the shareholders of Company will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and (ii) neither Parent nor MergerCo has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any shareholder of Company, nor, for the avoidance of doubt, will Company stock be subject to any such liability.
 
8.
 
To the knowledge of Parent, Companys liabilities were incurred by Company in the ordinary course of its business.
 
9.
 
Parent has no plan or intention to make any distributions after, but in connection with, the Merger to holders of Parent stock, other than dividends paid in the ordinary course of business.
 
10.
 
Neither Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any person related to Parent within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(3) of the Treasury Regulations has any plan or intention to reacquire or redeem any of its stock issued in the transaction, either directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person (including by derivative transactions such as equity swaps which would have the economic effect of an acquisition), except in connection with any plan or intention to purchase stock on the open market as part of a repurchase program consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701.  For purposes of this representation, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or acq uired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such person is a partner in proportion to such persons interest in the partnership.
 
11.
 
Following the Merger, Company (or Surviving Entity, as applicable) will continue to conduct Companys coal business in a manner substantially similar to Companys conduct of that business prior to the Merger.
 
12.
 
At all times during MergerCos existence, Parent has directly owned all of the stock of MergerCo, and Parent will continue to own all such stock until the Merger.  MergerCo is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely to effectuate the Merger.  MergerCo (i) has not held and will not hold, at any time prior to the Merger, any assets (other than cash contributed by Parent upon incorporation) and (ii) has not conducted, and will not conduct at any time prior to the Merger, any business activities or other operations of any kind, other than any activities in connection with the Merger.
 
13.
 
In the Merger, MergerCo will have no liabilities assumed by Company and will not transfer to Company any assets subject to liabilities.
 
14.
 
Parent will have control of Company immediately after the Merger.  Parent has no plan or intention to, following the Merger, (i) cause or allow Company to
 
 
 
 
4
 
issue additional shares of stock to any person other than Parent or (ii) take any other action (including issuing any rights to acquire stock in Company or transferring stock in Company to any other person) that could result in Parent losing control of Company.  For purposes of this representation, control means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock.  For purposes of this representation, all references to Company shall be deemed to refer to Surviving Entity in the case of a Restructuring.
 
15.
 
After the Merger, Company will hold (i) to the knowledge of Parent, at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger and (ii) at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by MergerCo immediately prior to the Merger.  Alternatively, if a Restructuring occurs, to the knowledge of Parent, MergerCo will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger.  For p urposes of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets of Company or MergerCo, as applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts, if any (i) used (or to be used) by Company or MergerCo to pay Merger expenses, (ii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to holders of shares of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares or pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under applicable laws, (iii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to redeem stock, securities, warrants, or options of Company as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, and (iv) distributed (or to be distributed) by Company or MergerCo to the holders of Company stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part.  Any dispositions of assets held by Company or MergerCo prior to the Merger which were made in contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger will be for fair market value, and the proceeds thereof will b e retained by Company.
 
16.
 
Parent has no plan or intention to (i) liquidate Company, (ii) merge Company with or into another corporation or other entity, (iii) otherwise dispose of the stock of Company, or (iv) cause Company to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of Company acquired in the Merger, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers permitted by both Section 368(a)(2)(C) and Section 1.368-2(k) of the Treasury Regulations.  For purposes of this representation, all references to Company shall be deemed to refer to Surviving Entity in the case of a Restructuring.
 
17.
 
At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of Parent will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which those assets are subject.
 
18.
 
Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the last five years, directly or indirectly, more than 2,000 shares of stock or any debt securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any instrument giving the holder the right to acquire any such stock or debt securities.
 
 
 
 
5
 
19.
 
The Merger is being undertaken for purposes of enhancing the business of Parent and for other good and valid business purposes of Parent.
 
20.
 
There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.
 
21.
 
Neither Parent nor MergerCo is under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or under any receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding.
 
22.
 
Neither Parent nor MergerCo is an investment company as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).
 
23.
 
Neither Parent nor MergerCo has taken, agreed to take or failed to take any action, and does not know of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance the result of which is reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a).
 
24.
 
Neither Parent nor MergerCo (or Surviving Entity, as applicable) will take any position on any Federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or any representations or certifications herein, unless otherwise required by a determination (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code) or by applicable state or local tax law (and then only to the extent required by such applicable state or local tax law).
 
25.
 
The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth herein on behalf of Parent, MergerCo and the management thereof.
 
The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinion will be based on the accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents related thereto, and (ii) your opinion will be subject to certain limitations and qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of such covenants or obligations are not satisfied in all material respects.  The undersigned further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinion, you may consider each of the representations contained herein to be true, correct and complete without regard to any knowledg e qualification.

Very truly yours,
Parent

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
The undersigned, an officer of [Company], a Delaware corporation (Company), is making the representations in this letter on behalf of Company in connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [], 2011 (the Merger Agreement), among [Parent], a Delaware corporation (Parent), Company and [MOUNTAIN MERGER SUB, INC.], a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (MergerCo), and in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the registration statement on Form S-4 (the Registration Statement), each as amended or supplemented through the date hereof.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, MergerCo shall be merged with and into Company (the Merger) with Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  Alternatively, if the direction of the Merger is reversed pursuant to section 2.01(d) of the Merger Agreement (the Restructuring), Company shall be merged with and into MergerCo with MergerCo continuing as the surviving entity, which may be a limited liability company if Parent so elects (such entity, Surviving Entity).  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.  All Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise noted.
 
The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and represents on behalf of Company as follows:
 
1.
 
The facts relating to the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Company, true, correct and complete in all material respects.  The Merger will be consummated in accordance with
 
 
 
 
2
 
the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Registration Statement.  Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement and the Registration Statement, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a) any of Company, its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of Parent, its affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger or otherwise.
 
2.
 
All the outstanding shares of Company stock as of the date hereof consist of [103,300,348] shares of common stock, all of which are entitled to vote in elections of the Board of Directors.  Company has not treated any other right or instrument, including any debt instrument, warrant, option or convertible security, as equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
 
3.
 
Unless a Restructuring occurs, shares of Company stock representing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Company stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of Company stock will be exchanged solely for Parent voting stock pursuant to the Merger.  For purposes of this representation, shares of Company stock exchanged for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Parent (including cash paid to dissenting stockholders) will be treated as outstanding Company stock on the Closing Date.
 
4.
 
At least 40 percent of the aggregate consideration received by Company shareholders in the Merger will be comprised of Parent common stock (based on the fair market value of Parent common stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed).  For purposes of this representation, the aggregate consideration shall include payments, if any, made to dissenters in connection with the Merger.
 
5.
 
Cash payments to be made to Company shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock that would otherwise be issued to such holders in the Merger will be made solely for the purpose of saving Parent the expense and inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Parent stock and will not represent separately bargained-for consideration.  To the knowledge of Company, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Company shareholders.  No Company shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers, will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent stock.
 
6.
 
The fair market value of Parent stock and other consideration received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arms-length negotiations between the respective managements of Parent and Company.

7.
 
None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company (including pursuant to any consulting agreement) represents separate consideration for, or is allocable to, any of their Company stock.  None of the Parent stock that will be received in connection with the Merger by any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the performance of any services.  The compensation paid to any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company will be for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and h as been or will be determined by bargaining at arms length.
 
8.
 
Except for expenses directly related to the Merger within the guidelines set forth in Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187, (i) Parent, MergerCo, Company and the shareholders of Company will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and (ii) to the knowledge of Company, neither Parent nor MergerCo has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any shareholder of Company, nor, for the avoidance of doubt, will Company stock be subject to any such liability.

13.
 
Company has a historic business or significant historic business assets, in either case within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(d) of the Treasury Regulations.  No assets of Company have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from conducting Companys coal business following the Merger.
 
14.
 
At the time of the Merger, Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parents acquisition or retention of control of Company.

Alternatively, if a Restructuring occurs, MergerCo will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger.  For purposes of this representat ion, the following amounts will be treated as assets of Company or MergerCo, as applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts, if any (i) used (or to be used) by Company or MergerCo to pay Merger expenses, (ii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to holders of shares of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares or pursuant to the exercise of dissenters rights under applicable laws, (iii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to redeem stock, securities, warrants, or options of Company as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, and (iv) distributed (or to be distributed) by Company or MergerCo to the holders of Company stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part.  Any dispositions of assets held by Company or MergerCo prior to the Merger which were made in contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger will be for fair market value, and the proceeds thereof will be retained by Company.
 
17.

ALPHA NATURAL RESOURCES AND MASSEY ENERGY AGREE
TO $8.5 BILLION COMBINATION
Combination creates a premier coal operator in the United States and
a global leader in metallurgical coal supply
Merged company will have a total reserve base of approximately 5 billion tons with one of the
worlds largest, highest-quality metallurgical coal reserve bases
Transaction expected to benefit stockholders and customers of both companies through substantial
synergies with cash flow accretion in first full year of operations
______________________________
 
Abingdon, VA and Richmond, VA  January 29, 2011 
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.
(NYSE: ANR) (Alpha) and Massey Energy Company (NYSE: MEE) (Massey) announced
today that they signed a definitive agreement under which Alpha will acquire all outstanding
shares of Massey common stock, subject to customary closing conditions including stockholder
approval of both companies. Under the terms of the agreement, Massey stockholders will
receive, at the closing, 1.025 shares of Alpha common stock and $10.00 in cash for each share of
Massey common stock. Based on the closing share price of Alpha common stock as of January
28, 2011, the agreement placed a value of $69.33 per share of Massey common stock (implying
$8.5 billion enterprise value for Massey) and represents a 21% premium to Masseys current
share price. Upon completion of the transaction, Alpha and Massey stockholders will own
approximately 54% and 46% of the combined company, respectively. 
 
The merger will bring together Alphas and Masseys highly complementary assets, which
include more than 110 mines and combined coal reserves of approximately 5 billion tons,
including one of the worlds largest and highest-quality metallurgical coal reserve bases. Alpha
and Massey believe the new entity will be well positioned to capitalize on strong global demand
trends for coal including the metallurg ical coal used in the steel manufacturing process. Further,
the combination is expected to permit Alpha and Massey to benefit from geographical and asset
diversification, including operations and reserves in Central and Northern Appalachia, the
Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. 
 
The resulting company will have an attractive financial profile with expected pro forma 2010
revenues of approximately $6.9 billion and the highest free cash flow generation of any pureplay
U.S. coal company, a responsible balance sheet, and significantly enhanced scale with a
combined enterprise value of approximately $15 billion. Stockholders and customers of both
companies will also benefit from synergies which are exp ected to exceed an annual run-rate of
$150 million within the second year of operations, as well as anticipated cash flow accretion in
the first full year of combined operations. 
 
Were very pleased that Massey has chosen to join forces with Alpha and commit to this truly
transformational deal, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer. Together we
will be Americas largest supplier of metallurgical coal for the worlds steel industry and a
highly diversified supplier of thermal coal to electric utilities in the U.S. and overseas. The
strat egic and operational fit of our two companies is clear and compelling. Both companies s
tockholders will gain an opportunity to participate in the upside potential of a global industry
leader with a robust production portfolio, attractive growth profile and substantial reserve base. 
Together, we are committed to creating a stronger company that has the scale to capitalize on
further growth opportunities, succeed in a changing regulatory landscape and maintain the
absolute highest standards in safety and environmental excellence. 
 
Baxter F. Phillips, Jr., Masseys chief executive officer and president, stated, This transaction
represents a tremendous opportunity for Massey to partner with our Central Appalachian
neighbor, Alpha, to create a new industry leader. After a careful review of a wide range of
strategic opportunities, our board unanimously determined that this is the right course for our 
company. The merger with Alpha off ers Massey stockholders an immediate and substantial
premium, as well as the opportunity to participate in the significant value creation opportunities
our combination presents. We have always respected Alphas passion for this business and we
believe this is a natural and logical combination that has great upside for our members,
communities, customers and other important constituents. 
 
Mr. Crutchfield added, As we demonstrated in the Foundation transaction, we have a proven
history of successful integrations since our inception in 2002, and weve built a strong track
record of creating value through thoughtful strategic growth. Were already prepared to launch a
seamless integration process, which includes implementing our employee-driven
Running Right
philosophy of safety and environmental stewardship across the business. This is not just a
combination of strong asset portfolios, but a transaction that will empower a combined group of
almost 14,000 people and with a focus on continued investment in safety, the environment and
our communities. 
 
Alphas chairman, Mike Quillen, commented, Weve always believed that the combination of
Alpha and Massey makes for a great partnership, and were thrilled about the opportunities this
will create for the employees of both organizations. Their talents, skills and ambition will be the
foundation of a dynamic industry leader. 
 
The boards of directors of Alpha and Massey have each approved the terms of the definitive
merger agreement and have recommended that their respective stockholders approve the
transaction. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2011 and is subject to approval by each
companys stockholders and customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. 
 
Alpha has obtained $3.3 billion in committed financing from Morgan Stanley and Citi which, in
addition to existing cash balances, will be sufficient to finance cash consideration to Massey

Exhibit 99.2
 
January 29, 2011
 
 
This afternoon, Alpha announced that we have agreed to acquire Massey Energy in a move that would make us Americas largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the worlds steel industry and a premier supplier of thermal coal to U.S. utilities.  A copy of the press release, a map of Central Appalachia operations and a brief question-and-answer document is attached for your convenience.
 
Alpha has long recognized the value that this combination can create.  Alpha and Massey are a clear strategic fit  geographically, operationally and financially.  Both of us have deep roots in Central Appalachia and considerable experience: we know how to mine coal in this region and mine it well.  Upon completion of the transaction, we will have an enviable network of high quality reserves, surface and underground mines, preparation facilities and logistics resources. We will have a wide range of quality metallurgical and steam products and a customer base that spans the globe. Our combination will create long-term benefits for both organizations and their employees. 
 
For our own employees and operations, acquiring Massey will greatly extend our reserve life (we will be #2 in coal reserves in the U.S.) and give us tremendous flexibility in our mining and sales planning.  It will mean greater opportunities for our employees within a larger network of operations (more than110 mines combined).  It will mean a stronger organization with more capabilities and resources to withstand the many challenges facing the coal industry today.  For the employees of both organizations, it represents an opportunity to be a world-class coal producer with an unparalleled commitment to  especially when it comes to protecting the safety and health of employees and respecting the environment.  For our communities, it represents jobs, enhanced stability and better economic prospects long term. 
Running Right
 
Granted, Massey has faced a number of big challenges recently.  In no way does that take away from the fact that Massey employees are hard-working, highly experienced and driven to succeed.  We believe that our philosophy will help them flourish even more within Alpha, because they come to an organization that strives to involve and empower people at all levels.  Combined, we will be a force of approximately 14,000 people dedicated to powering the world through the energy of our people.  The work to bring both organizations together will be well worth it. 
Running Right
 
This afternoons announcement is just the first step of the process.  We expect the transaction to close in mid-2011, but first we must complete certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. So until closing it is important that we remember we are still separate companies. We will conduct business as usual and we will continue to compete with Massey like we would any other company.  As we move through the process, we can assure you that we will make every effort to communicate regularly to tell you as much as we can, as soon as we can. We will be setting aside a special section on AlphaNet where information on the transaction will be posted. In the meantime we hope you will stay focused and  most importan tly  operate safely, stay focused and keep
Running Right.
 
One important closing comment: it is critical that all communications on this matter be limited to Alphas senior management team and our advisors.  We respectfully ask you not to discuss this matter with the media or anybody else outside of Alpha.  If you need to communicate with anybody at Massey in your normal course of business or at gatherings, please decline to comment or speculate on the transaction.

Questions and Answers
1. Why is Alpha acquiring Massey now?
This is truly a transformational deal for Alpha. With Massey, we will become the third largest U.S. producer by sales volume and well have one of the world's largest, highest-quality metallurgical reserve coal bases. We will have nearly 14,000 people dedicated to making Alpha the best coal company in America. Being a bigger organization will set us up to pursue further growth opportunities we expect. It will also enable us to better deal with a tough regulatory landscape, and reinforce strong standards in safety and environmental excellence.
 
2. Why does this make sense for Alpha?
This transaction represents a tremendous opportunity for both Alpha and Massey to create a new industry leader. Alpha and Massey are logical partners  geographically, operationally and financially. Were neighbors: both of us have deep roots and operating experience in Appalachia and are committed to bringing economic benefits to the region. We have the right management team to combine and run these assets and, thanks to all of you, a strong track record of successfully integrating merged or acquired mining companies. This will be Alphas 11merger or acquisition since we were founded less than 10 years ago.
th
 
3. How will the combined companies move forward from the Upper Big Branch mine accident that happened last year?
The accident at Upper Big Branch last April was a heart-wrenching time for miners everywhere. Our thoughts continue to go out to the miners families, and we can only hope that time will mend the pain theyre suffering. We cant turn back time, but we can take the best of what we have learned through our safety process and instill those values and best practices in Masseys mining operations.
Running Right
 
4. How will this acquisition affect me?
This deal should create a number of long-term benefits for employees in both organizations, and benefits for other stakeholders too. For employees of Alphas affiliates, it represents greater longevity of reserve life  a critically important move for us since coal reserves in Central Appalachia have been in constant decline. There should be greater opportunities for people within a larger network of operations  we will have more than 100 mines combined. For both organizations employees, it creates an opportunity to be a world class coal producer with an unparalleled commitment to  particularly when it comes to safety and the environment. For our communities, it means enhanced stability, well-paying jobs and better economic prospects long term. And for our customers, it means a better, stronger and more diversified supplier.
Running Right
 
5. How will the combined company be integrated? Are there many overlaps?
Having been through the Foundation integration recently, we have a proven and tested model for smoothly integrating large companies. Moreover, what we learned from that integration will help make the process with Massey even smoother. Until we get deep into that process and learn more about how Massey runs its business, its just too early at this point to talk specifically about how the integration process might impact individuals. Our focus right now is on getting the transaction approved by regulatory agencies and
approved by both companies stockholders, and also preparing for the integration. We have small teams working on this now and youll hear more about what theyre doing in the weeks ahead. 
It is important to stress that this proposed transaction is primarily about growth. We think highly of Masseys miners. Theyre skilled, dedicated and innovative. We are convinced that they will benefit greatly from the expanded opportunities and resources available to them as part of a larger and stronger organization, with greater long-term growth prospects.
 
6. Will the combined companys headquarters still be in Abingdon, VA?
Yes, headquarters will remain in the Abingdon, Virginia area. A new building was already underway in nearby Bristol, Virginia before this deal was announced. At this time we also plan to retain an office in Richmond, Virginia, where Massey is currently headquartered.
 
7. What happens between now and the close of the transaction?
At this point, the best and most important thing for all of us to do is to remain focused on business as usualand most importantly on being safe. Until the transaction closes, we will continue to operate as independent companies. We should do everything we can to ensure that we dont miss a beat in delivering on our commitments to customers. It may take some time to clear the normal regulatory and other hurdles, and both companies still have to schedule and hold a shareholder vote to approve the deal.
 
8. Whats the timing of this deal being completed?
Right now we think the transaction should close in mid-2011. We will keep you informed of major developments throughout this process.
 
9. Should I start working with my counterparts at Massey?
No. While a few small teams have started planning and will be in discussions with their counterparts at Massey, we cannot implement the true integration process until after the transaction closes. Until that time, it is important for all of us to remember that we will still operate as independent companies.
 
10. What should we be telling other people?
It is critical that all communications on this matter be limited to Alphas senior management team and our advisors. We respectfully ask you not to discuss this matter with the media or anybody else outside of Alpha. If you need to communicate with anybody at Massey in your normal course of business or at gatherings, please decline to comment or speculate on the transaction. If you receive any inquiries for further information regarding the transaction or if you have any questions about communicating with people outside of Alpha, please direct them to our Corporate Communications Department (alphacorporatecommunications@alphanr.com).
 
11. Who should I contact if I have additional questions? Where can I find more information about this transaction?
Communications will be ongoing, both leading up to the closing date and after the closing date. If you have other questions that are not answered here, contact alphacorporatecommunications@alphanr.com.
