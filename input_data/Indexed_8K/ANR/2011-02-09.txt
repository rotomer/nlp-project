Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR), a leading U.S. coal producer, reported fourth quarter net income of $10.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to net income of $17.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Alpha reported fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $11.0 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of $20.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Excluding merger related expenses, reversal of certain income tax reserves, and amortization of coal supply agreements, fourth quarter 2010 adjusted income from continuing operations was $32.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share.
ABINGDON, Va., February 9, 2011
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2010 was $154.7 million, compared to $199.1 million in the year ago period.  Excluding merger related expenses, fourth quarter 2010 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $163.4 million.  
 
*These are non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of adjusted income  from continuing operations to income from continuing operations, and a reconciliation of both EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to income from continuing operations are included in tables accompanying the financial schedules.
 
 
 
 
Alpha continued its strong focus on safety performance during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer.  Among our Eastern operations, nine operations in our Southern West Virginia business unit, nine operations in our Virginia/Kentucky business unit, seven operations in our Northern West Virginia business unit, and all of our AMFIRE surface mines completed the year 2010 without a single lost time accident.  We are proud of our entire workforce and their dedication to Alphas Running Right culture that has driven continuous improvements in safety performance throughout our history.  On a separate note, it is with great sorrow that I inform our investors of the passing earlier this year of Alphas long-time b oard member, John W. (Bill) Fox.  As one of our most trusted friends and advisors, he will be deeply missed.
Alpha announced that it agreed to acquire Massey Energy on January 29.  This transformational combination delivers on Alphas long-standing strategic objectives, creating a leader in the United States and globally. When the transaction closes, the Company will be the second largest in the United States in terms of reserves, with approximately 5.1 billion tons; third largest in terms of total shipments; and the leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal, with approximately 1.7 billion tons of metallurgical reserves and an expected 24 to 26 million tons of metallurgical coal shipments on a combined pro forma basis in 2011.  Our primary focus going forward will be maintaining operational excellence within Alpha 7;s core business.  At the same time, we are dedicated to closing the Massey acquisition as quickly as practicable, and then executing our detailed plan for integrating our two companies.  This combination has obvious and compelling benefits for both companies, their shareholders and their customers, but it will also require intense focus and unflagging commitment in order to integrate and maximize the performance of both organizations, and this is our singular mission for the foreseeable future.
th
Looking back over Alphas fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, the Company achieved record revenue and EBITDA in 2010 despite subpar rail service, severe weather in the East and vessel delays at the ports experienced during the fourth quarter.  We are pleased with the relatively consistent performance that Alpha has delivered throughout the year, driven by our scale, diversification and business mix, which balances our position as the leading domestic supplier of metallurgical coal with the substantial margin generation power of our Pittsburgh #8 longwall mines and the stable contribution of our Western operations in the Powder River Basin.  After another year of positive free cash flow, Alphas total liquidity now stands at approximately $1.8 billion, and this strong financial position ha s enabled us to engage in the transaction with Massey Energy to create a true industry leader.
Looking forward, on a stand-alone basis Alpha anticipates another record year in 2011.  We expect to ship between 13 and 14.5 million tons of metallurgical coal this year, an all-time high for the Company.  In light of the devastating flooding recently experienced in Australia, spot prices for coking coal have risen above the recent first quarter benchmark settlement, and tight overseas market conditions are expected to persist throughout the year.  As the largest exporter of metallurgical coal among U.S. producers, Alpha is positioned to benefit from our ability to serve the seaborne metallurgical market in 2011, and these market conditions bode well for Alphas prospects in 2012 with over 90 percent of our 2012 metallurgical coal shipments open to market pricing.
 
 
 
Financial Performance
During the fourth quarter Alpha shipped 13.4 million tons of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal, up from 12.1 million tons in the year ago period and 12.3 million tons in the third quarter of 2010.  Eastern steam coal shipments were 5.8 million tons compared with 6.6 million tons last year and flat compared to the prior quarter.  Metallurgical coal shipments during the quarter were 3.0 million, flat sequentially and up 17 percent compared with 2.5 million tons in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Average per ton realization for PRB shipments rose to $10.94 compared to $10.52 in the fourth quarter last year.  The per ton average realization for Eastern steam coal shipments rose to $67.04 compared to $62.57 in the year ago period, and the average per ton realization for metallurgical coal increased to $114 .87 in the fourth quarter compared to $97.18 last year.
 
 
 
 
Full Year 2010
Results
During 2010, Alphas coal shipments totaled 84.8 million tons, including 65.3 million tons from the former Foundation operations, compared with 47.2 million tons for the full year 2009, which included 28.2 tons from former Foundation operations.  Metallurgical coal shipments in 2010 rose to 11.9 million tons, up 46 percent from 8.1 million tons shipped during 2009.  Shipments of PRB coal and Eastern steam coal in 2010 were 49.0 million tons and 24.0 million tons, respectively, compared with 20.8 million tons and 18.3 million tons in the previous year.    
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 was $182.6 million compared to $194.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009.  For the full year 2010, cash provided by operations increased to $693.6 million compared with $356.2 million in 2009.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 were $85.9 million and $308.9 million, respectively, compared to $84.3 million and $187.1 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2009.  
At the end of the fourth quarter, Alpha had available liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion, consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of an aggregate $832.1 million, plus $932.9 million available under the companys secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility.  Total long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt at December 31, 2010, was $754.2 million compared with $790.3 million at December 31, 2009.  
 
 
 
Market Overview
The market for thermal coal continues to improve both within the United States and globally.  Utility stockpiles in the United States declined from a peak of greater than 200 million tons in late 2009 to an estimated 166 million tons at the end of 2010.  Coal-fired electricity generation in 2010 increased by approximately six percent, while overall generation increased by approximately four percent, although low-cost natural gas led to fuel switching in favor of gas late in the year.  Demand is expected to continue to exceed domestic supply in 2011, which is anticipated to result in utility inventories returning to more normal levels by the end of the year.  In addition, quoted pricing for seaborne thermal coal bound for Europe has risen on concerns that traditional sources of supply, including coals from South Africa and Colombia, are increasingly being diverted to satisfy rapidly growing Asian demand.  These seaborne price levels suggest that U.S. thermal exports to Europe are likely to increase in 2011.
The global market for metallurgical coal strengthened significantly in 2010, and global market conditions appear likely to continue to improve in 2011, driven by increasing demand primarily in Asia.  China increased its metallurgical coal imports by 37 percent to an estimated 47 million metric tonnes in 2010.  The trend in China is expected to continue with steel production forecast to exceed 650 million metric tonnes in 2011, up from approximately 600 million metric tonnes in 2010.  By December, Chinese metallurgical coal imports had reached an annualized run-rate of 64 million metric tonnes.  Recent severe flooding in Australia has hampered both coal production and the transportation infrastructure, driving spot prices for high quality metallurgical coal above the recent first quarter benchma rk settlement.  Given increasing global demand and constrained seaborne supply, producers in the United States should benefit as the United States produces far more metallurgical coal than the domestic steel industry consumes, and the Eastern U.S. is one of the few production regions that has excess export capacity.  U.S. metallurgical coal exports exceeded 50 million tons in 2010, and are likely to increase again in 2011 in response to growing global demand.
Strong export demand and global supply disruptions suggest that more coals are likely to cross over from the steam market into the export metallurgical market.  When viewed together with the prospect of increasing thermal coal exports to Europe, realizations for thermal coal in the Eastern U.S. should improve in the near-term.
 
 
 
Outlook
On a stand-alone basis, both Alphas 2011 shipment guidance and Alphas 2011 cost of coal sales guidance remain unchanged from the Companys update provided on January 14, 2011.  As of January 26, 2011, all of Alphas expected 2011 PRB shipments are committed and priced at an average per ton realization of $11.82.  Expected 2011 Eastern steam coal shipments are 94 percent committed and priced at an average per ton realization of $65.44, and one percent of expected Eastern steam coal shipments is committed and unpriced.  Expected 2011 Eastern metallurgical coal shipments are 68 percent committed and priced at an average per ton realization of $142.23, and 26 percent of Alphas expected 2011 metallurgical coal shipments are committed and unpriced.  Selling, general a nd administrative expense is expected to range from $165 million to $175 million on a stand-alone basis in 2011.  Interest expense is projected to be between $60 million and $65 million in 2011, and capital expenditures, including the scheduled lease bonus installment payment at the Eagle Butte mine, are forecast to range between $340 million and $440 million for the year 2011.
Alpha is establishing stand-alone guidance on its contracted position and expected shipments in 2012.  PRB shipments in 2012 are expected to remain flat with 2011 in a range of 48 million tons to 52 million tons, with 62 percent committed and priced at an average per ton realization of $12.50.  Eastern steam coal shipments in 2012 are also expected to remain constant with 2011 shipment levels, ranging from 22 to 25 million tons, with 16 percent committed and priced at an average per ton realization of $69.93, and 36 percent of expected Eastern steam coal shipments are committed and unpriced.  Eastern metallurgical coal shipments in 2012 are expected to range from 13 to 14.5 million tons, with only 9 percent committed and priced and 46 percent committed and unpriced.  Committed and priced metall urgical tons are contracted at an average realization of $133.74 per ton.
