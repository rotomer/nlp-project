Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the business combination transaction involving Alpha and Massey, including future financial and operating results, the combined companys plans, objectives, expectations (financial or otherwise) and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.
 
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the ability to obtain regulatory approvals of the transaction on the proposed terms and schedule; the failure of Alpha or Massey stockholders to approve the transaction; the outcome of pending or potential litigation or governmental investigations; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; uncertainty of the expected financial performance of Alpha following completion of the proposed transaction; Alphas ability to achieve the cost savings and synergies contemplated by the proposed transaction within the expected time frame; disruption from the proposed transaction making it more difficult to maintai n relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the calculations of, and factors that may impact the calculations of, the acquisition price in connection with the proposed merger and the allocation of such acquisition price to the net assets acquired in accordance with applicable accounting rules and methodologies; general economic conditions that are less favorable than expected; changes in, renewal of and acquiring new long term coal supply arrangements; and competition in coal markets. Additional information and other factors are contained in Alphas and Masseys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including Alphas and Masseys Annual Reports on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, recent Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other SEC filings, which are available at the SECs web site http://www.sec.gov.  Alpha and Massey disclaim any obligation to update and revise statements contained in these material s based on new information or otherwise.
