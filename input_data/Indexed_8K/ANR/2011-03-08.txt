Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
On March 3, 2011, Mervin Miller Contracting, an independent construction contractor for AMFIRE Mining Company, LLC (AMFIRE), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that three men were working on the roof of a building under construction at the Madison Mine, without properly attaching the fall protection equipment they were wearing.  AMFIRE was not cited, and no injuries occurred in connection with the cited condition.  The order was terminated on March 3, 2011.
