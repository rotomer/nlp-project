Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Underwriting Agreement
 
On May 18, 2011, Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. ("Alpha") and certain of Alpha's wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on behalf of themselves and the other underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (collectively, the "Underwriters"), to issue and sell to the Underwriters $800 million aggregate principal amount of 6% senior notes due 2019 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior notes due 2021 (together, the "Senior Notes").  Alpha estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be approximately $1.47 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.  Alpha intends to use the proceeds from this offering to finance a portion of its proposed acquisition of Massey Energy Company ("Massey").
 
The sale of the Senior Notes was made pursuant to Alpha's registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-165473) (the "Registration Statement") previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), including the prospectus dated March 15, 2010, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated May 19, 2011 filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).
 
The Underwriting Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants by Alpha customary for agreements of this nature. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of Alpha and the Underwriters against certain liabilities arising out of, or in connection with, the sale of the Senior Notes and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities. The sale of the Senior Notes is expected to close on June 1, 2011.
 
Alpha intends to consummate its proposed acquisition of Massey concurrently with the issuance of the Senior Notes. If the proposed acquisition of Massey is not consummated concurrently with the offering or on or prior to September 1, 2011, Alpha will redeem the Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture governing the Senior Notes.  Alpha may redeem the Senior Notes prior to such date if it determines in its sole discretion that the Merger will not be consummated on or prior to September 1, 2011.
 
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is a summary and is not meant to be a complete description of this agreement. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1, and incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Registration Statement.
 
Certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates have provided and may provide certain commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for Alpha and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, from time to time, certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in Alpha's debt or equity securities or loans, and may do so in the future.
 
Affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are lenders under Alpha's existing credit agreement and, as such, will receive a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes. Each of the Underwriters or their affiliates will be agents and/or lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is also acting as a financial advisor to us in connection with the acquisition of Massey and will receive customary fees in connection therewith.
 
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
 
On May 19, 2011, in connection with the acquisition of Massey, Alpha entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to amend and restate in its entirety the credit agreement dated as of July 30, 2004, as amended as of November 12, 2004 and as of October 18, 2005, as amended and restated as of July 7, 2006, as amended effective July 31, 2009 and as further amended and restated as of April 15, 2010 (as so amended and restated, the "Existing Credit Agreement"; the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended and restated by the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, is referred to as the "New Credit Agreement"), with Citicorp North
 
America, Inc., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, National Association, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Union Bank, N.A. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as co-documentation agents, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as sole syndication agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, and various other financial institutions, as lenders.  The terms of the New Credit Agreement will amend and restate and supersede the Existing Credit Agreement in its entirety upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the consummation of the acquisition of Massey on or prior to September 1, 2011 (the satisfaction of such conditions precedent is referred to as the "initial Credit Event").  The Existing Credit Agreement will remain in full force and effect until the occurrence of the initial Credit Event and, if the initial Credit Event does not occur on or prior to September 1, 2011, then the New Credit Agreement will terminate, without any effect on the Existing Credit Agreement.
 
Upon the occurrence of the initial Credit Event, the New Credit Agreement will provide for a $600 million senior secured term loan A facility (the "Term Loan Facility") and a $1,000 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility").  Pursuant to the New Credit Agreement, Alpha may request incremental term loans or increase the revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $1,250 million, plus an additional $750 million subject to compliance with a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio.  The lenders under these facilities will not be under any obligation to provide any such incremental loans or commitments, and any such addition of or increase in such loans or commitments will be subject to certain customary conditions precedent.
 
Interest Rate and Fees
.  Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus, at Alpha's option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the rate that Citibank, N.A. announces from time to time as its prime or base commercial lending rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (iii) a LIBO rate for a 30-day interest period as determined on such day, plus 1.00%, or (b) a LIBO rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs.  The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the New Credit Agreement will be 1.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and 2.50% with respect to LIBO rate borrowings.  Commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2011, the applicable margin for borrowings under the New Credit Agreement will be subject to adjustment each fiscal quarter based on Alpha's consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding fiscal quarter.  Swingline loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin.  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the New Credit Agreement, Alpha will be required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The initial commitment fee is 0.50% per annum.  Commencing with the completion of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2011, the commitment fee will be subject to adjustment each fiscal quarter based on Alpha's consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding fiscal quarter.  Alpha must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agency fees.
 
Mandatory Prepayments
.  The New Credit Agreement requires Alpha to prepay outstanding loans, subject to certain exceptions, with (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds (including the fair market value of noncash proceeds) of certain asset sales and condemnation events in excess in any fiscal year of the greater of $1,500 million and 15% of consolidated tangible assets as of the end of each fiscal year, (ii) 100% of the aggregate gross proceeds (including the fair market value of noncash proceeds) of certain Intracompany Disposals (as defined in the Credit Agreement) exceeding $500 million during the term of the New Credit Agreement and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence or issuance of certain debt, other than debt permitted under the New Credit Agreement. Mandatory prepayments will be applied first to the Term Loan Facility and thereafter to reductions of the commitments under the Revolving Facility. If at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding revolving loans, swingline loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the Revolving Facility exceeds the commitment amount, Alpha will be required to repay outstanding loans or cash collateralize letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, with no reduction of the commitment amount.
 
Voluntary Prepayments; Reductions in Commitments
. Alpha may prepay, in whole or in part, amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement, with prior notice but without premium or penalty (other than customary "breakage" costs with respect to LIBO rate loans) and in certain minimum amounts.  Alpha may also repurchase loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility pursuant to standard reverse Dutch auction and open market purchase provisions, subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  Alpha may make voluntary reductions to the unutilized commitments of the Revolving Facility from time to time without premium or penalty.
 
Amortization and Final Maturity
.  Beginning on September 30, 2011, Alpha is required to make scheduled quarterly amortization payments with respect to loans under the Term Loan Facility.  In the last two quarters of 2011
 
and the first two quarters of 2012, each quarterly amortization payment will be in an amount equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans.  In the last two quarters of 2012 and the first two quarters of 2013, each quarterly amortization payment will be in an amount equal to 2.5% of the original principal amount of the term loans.  In the last two quarters of 2013 and the first two quarters of 2014, each quarterly amortization payment will be in an amount equal to 3.75% of the original principal amount of the term loans.  In the last two quarters of 2014 and the first two quarters of 2015, each quarterly amortization payment will be in an amount equal to 5% of the original principal amount of the term loans.  In the last two quarters of 2015 and the first two quarters of 2016, each quarterly amortization payment will be in an amount equal to 12.5% of the original principal amount of the term loans.  There is no scheduled amortization under the Revolving Facility.  The principal amount outstanding on the loans under the Revolving Facility will be due and payable on June 30, 2016.  The Term Loan Facility and Revolving Facility will each mature on June 30, 2016.
 
Guarantees and Collateral
.  All obligations under the New Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of Alpha's existing wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are required to be guaranteed by certain of Alpha's future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries.  All obligations under the New Credit Agreement and certain hedging and cash management obligations with lenders and affiliates of lenders thereunder are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of Alpha's assets and the assets of Alpha's subsidiary guarantors, in each case subject to exceptions, thresholds and limitations.
 
Certain Covenants and Events of Default
. The New Credit Agreement contains a number of negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict Alpha's ability and the ability of Alpha's subsidiaries to:
 
                                         
make investments, loans and acquisitions;

engage in transactions with its affiliates;

create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to Alpha from Alpha's restricted subsidiaries.
 
In addition, the New Credit Agreement requires Alpha to comply with certain financial ratio maintenance covenants.
 
The New Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including a cross-default provision in respect of any other indebtedness that has an aggregate principal amount exceeding $25 million.

Covenants of the Underwriters
 
8.             .
Indemnity and Contribution
 
(a)           Each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any documented and out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any road show as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act not constituting an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based Underwriter Information.
 
(b)           Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their affiliates, directors, members or partners, their officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and Guarantors to such Underwriter, but only with reference to Underwriter Information in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus, prospectus, any road show, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b).  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors and the total underwriting discounts
 
and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus.  The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e)           The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)            The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantors contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantors, their officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or the Guarantors and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
(g)           The name of the Underwriters and the statements set forth in the third, thirteenth and fourteenth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the Time of Sale Prospectus (to the extent such statements relate to the Underwriters) constitute the only information (the "") furnished by the Underwriters to the Issuers for the purposes of this Agreement.

If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.  In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.  Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters
 
as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their one counsel and any reasonably necessary local counsel) incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

Each Revolving Facility Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Facility Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Facility Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph (c), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender.  Any amounts received by a Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt
 
by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Facility Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to such Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to such Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (without duplication) such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.

(e)
          
If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.

The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in
such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Term Loans, Revolving Facility Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.  Nothing in this Section 2.19 shall be deemed to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender.

If any Lender (such Lender, a "") has failed to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, discharge or termination which pursuant to the terms of Section 9.08 requires the consent of all of the Lenders affected and with respect to which the Required Lenders shall have granted their consent, then provided no Event of Default then exists, the Borrower shall have the right (unless such Non-Consenting Lender grants such consent) to replace such Non-Consenting Lender by requiring such Non-Consenting Lender to assign its Loans, and its Commitments hereunder to one or more assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, that (a) all Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Non-Consenting Lender being replaced shall be paid in full to such Non-Consenting Lender concurrently with such assignment and (b) the replacement Lender shall purchase the foregoing by paying to such Non-Consenting Lender a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  In connection with any such assignment the Borrower, Administrative Agent, such Non-Consenting Lender and the replacement Lender shall otherwise comply with Section 9.04.

If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and approved by the Borrower and shall have accepted such appointment within 45 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York and an office in London, England (or a bank having an Affiliate with such an office) having a combined capital and surplus that is not less than $500 million or an Affiliate of any such bank.

After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.
 
SECTION 8.04.
                 
Each Agent in Its Individual Capacity
.  With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, each Agent in its individual capacity and not as Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the Agents and their Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or other Affiliates thereof as if it were not an Agent.
 
SECTION 8.05.
                 
Indemnification
.  Each Lender agrees (a) to reimburse the Agents, on demand, in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Commitments hereunder, or if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of its applicable outstanding Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements, as applicable) of any reasonable expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Agents, including reasonable counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as Agent or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; that no Lender shall be liable to an Agent for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
provided
expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.  The agreements in this Section 8.05 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of any Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.  The term "Lender" shall, to the extent such indemnification obligation arose prior to such party's resignation, replacement or assignment, for purposes of this Section 8.05, include any Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank.
SECTION 8.06.
                 
Lack of Reliance on Agents
.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents and any Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents, any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
 
SECTION 8.07.
                 
Withholding Taxes
.  To the extent required by any applicable laws, the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  Without limiting or expanding the provisions of Section 2.17, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent by the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, because the appropriate form was not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective).  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.07.  The agreements in this Section 8.07 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of any Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. The term "Lender" shall, for purposes of this Section 8.07, include any Swingline Lender and Issuing Bank.

Waivers; Amendment
.
 
(a)
          
No failure or delay of the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
