("Mountain Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Alpha"), completed its merger (the "Merger") with and into Massey Energy Company, a Delaware corporation ("Massey"), with Massey continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alpha.
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
As previously reported, on May 19, 2011, in connection with the Merger, Alpha entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, Bank of America, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., PNC Bank, National Association, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Union Bank, N.A. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., as co-documentation agents, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as sole syndication agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, and various other financial institutions, as lenders.
In connection with the New Credit Agreement, certain of Alpha's wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, including Massey and certain of Massey's wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the "Guarantors"), entered into an Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated as of June 1, 2011 (the "Guarantee and Collateral Agreement"), pursuant to which all obligations under the New Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors, and all obligations under the New Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of Alpha's assets and the assets of the Guarantors, including, in each case subject to customary exceptions and exclusions:
 
 
Additionally, the obligations under the New Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by certain real property of Alpha and the Guarantors.
This description of the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
New Notes Indenture and the New Senior Notes
On June 1, 2011, Alpha, the Guarantors and Union Bank, N.A., as trustee, entered into an indenture (the "Base Indenture") and a first supplemental indenture (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "New Notes Indenture") governing Alpha's newly issued 6% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes") and 6.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes" and, together with the 2019 Notes, the "New Senior Notes").
The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2011, and will mature on June 1, 2019. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2011, and will mature on June 1, 2021.
 
The New Senior Notes are Alpha's senior unsecured obligations, ranking senior in right of payment to all of Alpha's future debt that is subordinated in right of payment to the New Senior Notes and ranking equally in right of payment with all of Alpha's existing and future debt that is not subordinated in right of payment to the New Senior Notes. Each Guarantor's guarantee of the New Senior Notes is an unsecured obligation of that Guarantor, ranking senior in right of payment to all of that Guarantor's future debt that is subordinated in right of payment to that Guarantor's guarantee and ranking equally in right of payment with all of that Guarantor's existing and future debt that is not subordinated in right of payment to that Guarantor's guarantee. The New Senior Notes are effectively junior to all of Alpha's and the Guarantors' secured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that debt. The New Senior Notes are also subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Alpha's non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade payables and lease obligations.
Alpha may redeem the 2019 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2014, at a price equal to 100.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes plus a "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. Alpha may redeem the 2019 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time during the twelve months commencing June 1, 2014, at 103.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes, at any time during the twelve months commencing June 1, 2015, at 101.500% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes, and at any time after June 1, 2016, at 100.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. In addition, Alpha may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, at any time prior to June 1, 2014, at a redemption price equal to 106.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the applicable redemption date, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 notes originally issued under the New Notes Indenture remains outstanding after the redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering.
Alpha may redeem the 2021 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to June 1, 2016, at a price equal to 100.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes plus a "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. Alpha may redeem the 2021 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time during the twelve months commencing June 1, 2016, at 103.125% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, at any time during the twelve months commencing June 1, 2017, at 102.083% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, at any time during the twelve months commencing June 1, 2018, at 101.042% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, and at any time after June 1, 2019, at 100.000% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date. In addition, Alpha may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings, at any time prior to June 1, 2016, at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the applicable redemption date if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes originally issued under the New Notes Indenture remains outstanding after the redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to either series of New Senior Notes, unless Alpha has exercised its right to redeem those New Senior Notes, Alpha will be required to offer to repurchase each holder's New Senior Notes of such series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

The Guarantor hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest or notice with respect to such Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect to any sinking fund or analogous payment required under such Security and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by payment in full of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Security or as otherwise described in Section 2.02 of the Indenture.
 
This Guarantee shall be automatically and unconditionally released on the terms set forth in Section 2.02(c) of the Indenture [and Section [] of the supplemental indenture].

provided
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be direct, unconditioned and unsubordinated and will rank equally and ratably without preference and at least equally with other senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantor, except to the extent prescribed by law. The Holder of a guaranteed Security will be entitled to payment under the Guarantee without taking any action whatsoever against the Company.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Guarantee or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the guarantee of the Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, any additional amounts, and any sinking fund or analogous payments with respect to, the Security upon which this Guarantee is endorsed.
This Guarantee shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication of such Security shall have been manually executed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
All terms used in this Guarantee that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, TO THE COMPANY OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & Co. OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST
 
COMPANY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & Co. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & Co., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.

SECTION 3.07. . The Securities are issuable only in registered form. The Company will keep at each office or agency (the "Registrar") for each series of Securities a register or registers (the "Security Register(s)") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of Securities as provided in this Article. Such Security Register or Security Registers shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. At all reasonable times such Security Register or Security Registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee. The initial Registrar shall be the Trustee.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at each such office or agency, the Company shall execute a new Security or Securities of the same series, in each case, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate Principal Amount in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, the applicable Guarantors, if any, shall execute the Guarantees endorsed thereon and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery such Securities.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series (except a Security in global form) may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate Principal Amount and Stated Maturity, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive, the applicable Guarantors, if any, shall execute the Guarantees endorsed thereon and, upon receipt of a Company Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery such Securities.
A Holder may transfer a Security only by written application to the Registrar stating the name of the proposed transferee and otherwise complying with the terms of this Indenture. No such transfer shall be effected until, and such transferee shall succeed to the rights of a Holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer by the Registrar in the Security Register. Prior to the registration of any transfer by a Holder as provided herein, the Company, the Guarantors, if any, and the Trustee or any of their respective agents shall treat the person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner thereof for all purposes whether or not the Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, the Guarantors, if any, the Trustee, nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Furthermore, any Holder of a Global Security shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial interests in such Global Security may be effected only through a book entry system maintained by the Depository (or its nominee) and that ownership of a beneficial interest in the Security shall be required to be reflected in a book entry. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-Registrar with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an equal Principal Amount of Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as requested if the requirements for such transactions set forth herein are met. To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company shall execute the Securities, the applicable Guarantors, if any, shall execute the Guarantees endorsed thereon and the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar's request.
The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities (other than any such transfer taxes or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to Section 3.11, 9.05 or 11.03). No service charge to any Holder shall be made for any such transaction.
The Company shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of that series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities of any series selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any
 
Security of any series where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
SECTION 3.08. .
Book-Entry Provisions for Global Securities
(a) Each Global Security initially shall (i) be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for such Depositary and (iii) bear legends as set forth in Section 3.06.
Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("Agent Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under the Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, each Guarantor, if any, the Trustee and any of their respective agents as the absolute owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, each such Guarantor, the Trustee or any of such agents from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of any Security.
(b) Transfers of a Global Security shall be limited to transfers of such Global Security in whole, but not in part, to the Depositary for such series, its successors or their respective nominees. The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of a series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Securities. In such event, the Company will execute Securities of such series of like tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate Principal Amount equal to the Principal Amount of the Global Security or Securities of such series, the applicable Guarantors, if any, shall execute the Guarantees endorsed thereon and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, will authenticate and deliver such definitive Securities in exchange for such Global Security or Securities. Interests of beneficial owners in a Global Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary.
In addition, Physical Securities shall be transferred to all beneficial owners identified by the Depositary in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security, if (i) the Depositary (A) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, or (B) ceases to be qualified to serve as Depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so transferable, registrable and exchangeable, and such transfers shall be registrable, or (iii) an Event of Default of which the Trustee has actual notice has occurred and is continuing and the Registrar has received a request from a beneficial owner to issue such Physical Securities, and if the Trustee is the Registrar, a Company Order or written confirmation from the Depositary identifying the beneficial owner.
(c) Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Security will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Security and become an interest in the other Global Security and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Security for as long as it remains such an interest.
(d) In connection with any transfer of a portion of the beneficial interests in a Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 3.08, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the Principal Amount of such Global Security in an amount equal to the Principal Amount of the beneficial interest in such Global Security to be transferred, and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, one or more Physical Securities of like tenor and amount.
 
(e) In connection with the transfer of an entire Global Security to beneficial owners pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, such Global Security shall be deemed to be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation, and the Company shall execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, to each beneficial owner identified by the Depositary in exchange for its beneficial interest in such Global Security, an equal Principal Amount of Physical Securities of authorized denominations.
(f) The registered holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any person, including Agent Members and persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action which a Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities of such series.
SECTION 3.09. . In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute a new Security of the same series bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, the applicable Guarantors, if any, shall execute the Guarantees endorsed thereon and, upon the written request of any officer of the Company and delivery to the Trustee of all documents and certificates as required by this Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery such Security, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so apparently destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Company, each Guarantor, if any, the Trustee and any of their respective agents, such security or indemnity as may be required by each of them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption in full, shall become mutilated or defaced or be apparently destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Security of the same series, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company, each Guarantor, if any, the Trustee and any of their respective agents such Security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless from all risks, however remote, and, in every case of apparent destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company, each such Guarantor, the Trustee and any of such agents evidence to their satisfaction of the apparent destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Security and the Guarantee endorsed thereon, if any, issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any Security is apparently destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company and any Guarantor, as applicable, whether or not the apparently destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities and the Guarantees endorsed thereon, if any, duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.

Until so exchanged the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.

(d) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (i) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or a Guarantor of such series of Securities in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar law or (ii) a decree or order adjudging the Company or such Guarantor bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition of or in respect of the Company or such Guarantor under any applicable federal or state law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator, or other similar official of the Company or such Guarantor or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive calendar days;

In no event shall additional interest accrue at a rate per year in excess of 0.50% pursuant to the Indenture, regardless of the number of events or circumstances giving rise to the requirement to pay such additional interest. In addition to the accrual of such additional interest, on and after the 150th day immediately following the occurrence of an Event of Default resulting from the Company's failure to comply with any obligations the Company may be deemed to have pursuant to section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act or as set forth in Section 14.04, the Securities will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 5.02.
SECTION 5.02. .
Acceleration
(a) If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (d) or (e) of Section 5.01 hereof) occurs and is continuing with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of the affected series to be due and payable immediately. Except as set forth above, upon such declaration the principal of, premium, if any, and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in clause (d) or (e) of Section 5.01 hereof occurs with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, the unpaid principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without further action or notice on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.
(b) At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article 5 provided, the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the outstanding Securities of such series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if (i) the Company or a Guarantor has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay (A) all overdue interest on all of the Securities of that series, (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) Securities of that series which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities of that series, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in the Securities of that series, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and its agents and counsel and (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of that series,
 
other than the non-payment of the principal of the Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.04. No such rescission will affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 5.03. . If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal or interest on the Securities of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of such series or this Indenture.
Other Remedies
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities of such series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
SECTION 5.04. . The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the Securities of any series then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under this Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal (whether at Stated Maturity, upon redemption (if applicable), upon any required repurchase by the Company (if applicable) or otherwise) of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series or, in the case of the Securities of any series that are convertible or exchangeable, in the payment or delivery of any consideration due upon conversion or exchange of the Securities of that series (if applicable). The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any past Default hereunder. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any Default hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Waiver of Past Defaults
SECTION 5.05. . With respect to the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of that series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture, that the Trustee in good faith determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of that series or that may involve or cause the Trustee any potential liability. The Trustee may take any other action which it deems proper which is not inconsistent with any such direction.
Control by Majority
SECTION 5.06. . A Holder of any Security of any series may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of the applicable series only if:
Limitation on Suits

(d) during the 60-day period specified in (e) below, the Holders of a majority in aggregate Principal Amount of the then outstanding Securities of such series do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request; and
 
(e) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request and the offer of indemnity.
Holders shall not have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture or any Security to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holders or Holders of Securities of any other series, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
SECTION 5.07. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal (whether at Stated Maturity, upon redemption (if applicable), upon any required repurchase by the Company (if applicable) or otherwise) of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Security or, if applicable, payment or delivery of any consideration due upon conversion or exchange of any Security, in each case, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment or delivery on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of the Holder.
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment
SECTION 5.08. . If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company, any Guarantor or any other obligor for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, remaining unpaid on any Securities of such series and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof, including the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
Collection Suit by Trustee
SECTION 5.09. . The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any Guarantor (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties which the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim

Third: to the Company or, to the extent the Trustee collects any amount pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof from a Guarantor, to such Guarantor, or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct.
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 5.10 upon five Business Days prior notice to the Company.
SECTION 5.11. . In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.

SECTION 5.13. . Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section 3.09, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Rights and Remedies Cumulative
SECTION 5.14. . No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of Securities of any series to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
Delay or Omission Not Waiver

(c) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be conclusively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or by such other means as may be agreed by the Company and the Trustee at the time of determination that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(d) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with a Company Order or the direction of the Holders given as provided in Section 5.05 or otherwise exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Guarantors unless all payments due under this Indenture and the Notes (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured on an equal and ratable basis with the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien.
 
(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer will make an offer (a "") to each Holder of the Notes to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000) of that Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to, but not including, the date of purchase, subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date (the ""). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes in accordance with Article 3 of this Indenture the Issuer will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and stating:

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" attached to the Notes completed, or transfer by book-entry transfer, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;
(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the Notes purchased; and
(7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change in Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 4.11 hereof, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this Section 4.11 by virtue of such compliance.
(b) On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; that each new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
provided
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.11, the Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Section 4.11 and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.
 
The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
 
If the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or creates another Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary after the date of this Indenture, then that newly acquired or created Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary, if such Subsidiary guarantees any Indebtedness of the Issuer (unless such Subsidiary is a Receivables Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary) will become a Guarantor and execute a supplemental indenture and deliver an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Trustee within 30 days of the date on which it was acquired or created; that any Domestic Subsidiary that constitutes an Immaterial Subsidiary need not become a Guarantor until such time as it (i) ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary or (ii) guarantees a Credit Facility.
provided
 
The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than a Subsidiary specified in clause (4) of the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiary), the aggregate net book value of all outstanding
 
Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.05 hereof or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than a Subsidiary specified in clause (4) of the definition of Unrestricted Subsidiary) will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such designation and an Officers' Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.05 hereof. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.07, the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) (x) the Issuer could incur such Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test described in Section 4.07(a), or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such designation, in each case on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
provided
 
If on any date following the date of this Indenture, the Issuer certifies in a notice to the Trustee that: (i) a Ratings Event has occurred and (ii) at the time of the giving of such notice, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then, beginning on the day such notice is given, the covenants contained in Sections 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.14 and 5.01(4) hereof shall terminate.
 
The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly: (i) consolidate or merge with or into another Person; or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets (determined on a consolidated basis for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) in one or more related transactions to another Person, unless:
 
(1) either:
(A) the Issuer is the surviving entity; or
(B) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;
(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Issuer, as the case may be, under the Notes and this Indenture pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;
(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
(4) (a) the Issuer or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would, on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in Section 4.07(a) hereof; or
(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the successor entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less than such ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction.
In addition, the Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of the properties and assets of it and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to any other Person.
This Section 5.01 will not apply to:
(1) a merger of the Issuer with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction; or
(2) any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.
 
Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer in a
 
transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the provisions of, Section 5.01 hereof, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Issuer is merged or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition, the provisions of this Indenture referring to the "Issuer" shall refer instead to the successor Person and not to the Issuer), and may exercise every right and power of the Issuer, under this Indenture with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Issuer herein; , , that the predecessor shall not be relieved from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes except in the case of a sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer's properties or assets in a transaction that is subject to, and that complies with the provisions of, Section 5.01 hereof.
provided
however
 
Each of the following is an "":
Event of Default
(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;
(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes;
(3) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of Section 5.01 hereof;
(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days (90 days with respect to Section 4.03) after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any of the other agreements in this Indenture;
(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of this Indenture (but excluding Indebtedness owing to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), if that default:
(A) is caused by a failure to pay principal on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness following the Stated Maturity of such Indebtedness (a ""); or
Payment Default
 
(B) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity,
and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $200 million or more;
(6) failure by the Issuer or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final and non-appealable judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of $200.0 million (net of any amounts which are covered by insurance or bonded), which judgments are not paid, waived, satisfied, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days;
(7) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary pursuant to or within the meaning of Bankruptcy Law:
(A) commences a voluntary case,
(B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case,
(C) consents to the appointment of a custodian of it or for all or substantially all of its property, or
(D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
(8) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
(A) is for relief against the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case;
(B) appoints a custodian of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary or for all or substantially all of the property of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; or
(C) orders the liquidation of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary;
and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days; and
 
(9) except as permitted by this Indenture, any Note Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken as a whole would constitute a Significant Subsidiary is held in any final and nonappealable judgment or decree to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee and this Indenture), or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee and such Default continues for 10 days after receipt of the notice pursuant to Section 6.02.
 
In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (7) or (8) of Section 6.01 hereof, with respect to the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.
Upon any such declaration, the Notes shall become due and payable immediately.
The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all of the Holders, rescind an acceleration and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium or that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) of Section 6.01, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders of the Notes, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose the Issuer delivers an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or Guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of the Notes as described above be annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events.
 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall
 
not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
 
Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes rescind an acceleration or waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or interest on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase). Upon any such rescission or waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
 
A Holder may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if:
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
(3) such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
(4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
(5) during such 60-day period, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.
A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note.
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
 
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1) or (2) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuer for the whole amount of principal of, premium and interest remaining unpaid on, the Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
 
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable and documented compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 of the Base Indenture. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 of the Base Indenture out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money in the following order:
 
: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 6.07 of the Base Indenture, including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection;
First
: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium and interest, respectively; and
Second
: to the Issuer or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall direct in writing.
Third
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.
 
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and expenses against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.
 
The Issuer may at any time elect to have either Section 7.02 or 7.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes and Note Guarantees upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 7.
 
Upon the Issuer's exercise under Section 7.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 7.02, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes (including the Note Guarantees) on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, ""). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer and the Guarantors will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes (including the Note Guarantees), which will thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 7.05 hereof
Legal Defeasance
 
and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (1) and (2) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Notes, the Note Guarantees and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:
(1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 7.04 hereof;
(2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 hereof and Section 4.02 hereof;
(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith; and
(4) this Article 7.
Subject to compliance with this Article 7, the Issuer may exercise its option under this Section 7.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 7.03 hereof.
 
Upon the Issuer's exercise under Section 7.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 7.03, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.04 hereof, be released from each of their obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.03, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.15 and clauses (3) and (4) of Section 5.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 7.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, ""), and the Notes will thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but will continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes will not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and Note Guarantees, the Issuer and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and will have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes and Note Guarantees will be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Issuer's exercise under Section 7.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 7.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(3) through 6.01(6) hereof will not constitute Events of Default.
Covenant Defeasance
 
In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance under either Section 7.02 or 7.03 hereof:
(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm, or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium and interest on, the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;
(2) in the case of an election under Section 7.02 hereof, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that:
(A) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or
(B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law,
in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;
(3) in the case of an election under Section 7.03 hereof, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel confirming that the Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit and the grant of any Lien securing such borrowing);
(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;
 
(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and
(7) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
 
Subject to Section 7.06 hereof, all money and non-callable Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 7.05, the "") pursuant to Section 7.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes will be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Trustee
The Issuer will pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 7.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding Notes.
Notwithstanding anything in this Article 7 to the contrary, the Trustee will deliver or pay to the Issuer from time to time upon the request of the Issuer any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 7.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 7.04(1) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Issuer, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium or interest on, any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on its request or (if then held by the Issuer) will be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note will thereafter be permitted to look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease; , , that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer causes to be published once, in and

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any U.S. dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 7.02 or 7.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations under this Indenture and the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 7.02 or 7.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 7.02 or 7.03 hereof, as the case may be; , , that, if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of, premium or interest on, any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer will be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

Notwithstanding Section 8.02 of this Indenture, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees without the consent of any Holder of Note:
(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;
(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;
(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer's or a Guarantor's obligations to the Holders of the Notes and Note Guarantees by a successor to the Issuer or such Guarantor pursuant to Article 5 or Article 9 hereof, and the corresponding release of the Issuer's or such Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture;
(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any Holder;
(5) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
 
(6) to conform the text of this Indenture or the Notes or the Note Guarantees to any provision of the "Description of Notes" section of the Prospectus Supplement, to the extent that such provision in that "Description of Notes" was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of this Indenture, the Note Guarantees or the Notes;
(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in this Indenture as of the date hereof; or
(8) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes and to release Guarantors from the Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
Upon the request of the Issuer accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 6.02 of the Base Indenture, the Trustee will join with the Issuer and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee will not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
 
Except as provided below in this Section 8.02, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including, without limitation, Sections 4.08 and 4.11 hereof), the Notes or the Note Guarantees with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium or interest on, the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes).
Upon the request of the Issuer accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 6.02 of the Base Indenture, the Trustee will join with the Issuer and the Guarantors in the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
 
It is not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but it is sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
Without the consent of the Holders of at least 75% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may make any change to, or extend the time for performance under, the redemption provisions described under Section 3.08.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 becomes effective, the Issuer will mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Issuer to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuer with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes or the Note Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 8.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or extend the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes (except as provided above with respect to Sections 4.08 and 4.11 hereof);
(3) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or premium or interest on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
(6) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or impair the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium on, the Notes;
(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Sections 4.08 or 4.11 hereof);
(8) release any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; or
 
(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
 
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 of the Base Indenture, shall be entitled to receive and conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any amendment or supplement to this Indenture described in this Article 8 is permitted or authorized under and otherwise complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture. Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes will be set forth in a amended or supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
 
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms, it thereafter binds every Holder.
 
Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article 8, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
 
Notes may bear a notation approved by the Trustee as to form (but not as to substance) as to any matter provided for by any amendment, supplement or waiver to this Indenture entered into pursuant to this Article 8. If the Issuer or the Trustee shall so determine, new Notes of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors of the Issuer, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such amendment, supplement or waiver to this Indenture may be prepared by the Issuer, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Notes of such series then outstanding.
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
The Trustee will sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 8 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Issuer may not sign an amended or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors of the Issuer approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee will be provided with and (subject to Section 8.01 hereof) will be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 15.06 of the Base Indenture, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.
 
(a) Subject to this Article 9, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Issuer hereunder or thereunder, that:
(1) the principal of, premium and interest on, the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Issuer to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
(2) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise.
Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuer, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest, notice
 
and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture to the extent permitted by law.
(c) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Issuer or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, will be reinstated in full force and effect.
(d) Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) will forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee. The Guarantors will have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Note Guarantee.
 
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Note Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 9, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.03, no Guarantor may sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Issuer or another Guarantor, unless:
(1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
 
(2) either:
(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under this Indenture and its Note Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; or
(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person will succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clauses 2(a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Issuer or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuer or another Guarantor.
 
The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released:
(1) in connection with any sale, disposition or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, if the sale, disposition or transfer does not violate Section 4.08 hereof;
(2) in connection with any sale, disposition or transfer of all of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, if the sale, disposition or transfer does not violate Section 4.08 hereof;
(3) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture;
 
(4) upon Legal Defeasance in accordance with Article 7 hereof or satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture in accordance with Article 10 hereof; or
(5) upon the release of such Guarantors' Guarantee under the Credit Agreement or such other Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor's Note Guarantee.
Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee as provided in this Section 9.04 will remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest and premium on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in this Article 9.
 
This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued hereunder, when:
(1) either:
(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture; and
(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.
 
In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money has been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section 10.01, the provisions of Sections 10.02 and 7.06 hereof will survive such satisfaction and discharge. In addition, nothing in this Section 10.01 will be deemed to discharge those provisions of Section 7.07 hereof, that, by their terms, survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 7.06 hereof, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 10.01 hereof shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 10.01 hereof by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Issuer's and any Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 10.01 hereof; that if the Issuer has made any payment of principal of, premium or interest on, any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or Government Securities held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee
In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.

Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, if any such corrective document or instrument indicates that action has been taken by or at the request of the Company which could not have been taken had the original document or instrument not contained such error or omission, the action so taken shall not be invalidated or otherwise rendered ineffective but shall be and remain in full force and effect, except to the extent that such action was a result of willful misconduct or bad faith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Securities issued under the authority of such defective document or instrument shall nevertheless be the valid obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with all other Outstanding Securities, except as aforesaid.
Section 104. .
Acts of Holders; Record Dates
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series; provided that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any
 
notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take or revoke the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 512, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction or to revoke the same, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be sent to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record date may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, the Board Resolution (or action taken pursuant thereto), Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture referred to above may provide general terms or parameters for Securities of such series and provide either that the specific terms of particular Securities of such series shall be specified in a Company Order or that such terms shall be determined by the Company in accordance with other procedures specified in a Company Order as contemplated by the third paragraph of Section 303.

Section 302. .
Denominations
The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in fully registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301.

Section 303. .
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities, provided, however, that in the case of Securities offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver such Securities from time to time in accordance with such other procedures (including, without limitation, the receipt by the Trustee of oral or electronic instructions from the Company or its duly authorized agents, promptly confirmed in writing) acceptable to the Trustee as may be specified by or pursuant to a Company Order delivered to the Trustee prior to the time of the first authentication of Securities of such
 
series. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2) if the terms of such Securities have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, will be, established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been, or in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, will be, established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture, subject, in the case of Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel; and
(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
With respect to Securities of a series offered in a Periodic Offering, the Trustee may rely, as to the authorization by the Company of any of such Securities, the form and terms thereof and the legality, validity, binding effect and enforceability thereof, upon the Opinion of Counsel and the other documents delivered pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 and this Section, as applicable, in connection with the first authentication of Securities of such series.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature of an authorized officer, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the
 
Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this
Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 304. .
Temporary Securities
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
Section 305. .
Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office or in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1106 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed, the Security Registrar shall not be required (A) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, (B) to register the transfer of, or exchange, any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part or (C) to register the transfer of or exchange of any Security in respect of which a purchase notice has been given and not withdrawn, except the portion of the Security not purchased of any Security being purchased in part.
The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security and a successor Depositary has not been appointed by the Company within 90 days of receipt by the Company of such notification, (B) at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as such Depositary and no successor Depositary shall have been appointed by the Company within 90 days after it became aware of such cessation, or (C) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may at any time in its sole discretion determine that Securities issued in the form of a Global Security shall no longer be represented in whole or in part by such Global Security, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order therefor, shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in exchange in whole or in part for such Global Security.
(3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange or transfer of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for or upon transfer of a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this
 
Section, Section 304, 306, 906 or 1106 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
Section 306. .
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 307. .
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities)
 
are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
Section 308. .
Persons Deemed Owners
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Section 309. .

No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled
 
as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be required to destroy such cancelled Securities.
Section 310. .
Computation of Interest
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Section 311. .
CUSIP Numbers
The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.
Section 401. .
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when

Upon such declaration, such principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, shall become immediately due and payable, notwithstanding anything contained in this Indenture or the Securities to the contrary. If any Event of Default specified in Sections 501(5) and 501(6) occurs, all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, on the Securities then outstanding will automatically become due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of the then outstanding Securities.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any specific series, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of that series, may waive the Event of Default giving rise to such declaration of acceleration and such Event of Default shall be deemed to have been waived, and such declaration and its consequences shall, without further act, be deemed to have been rescinded and annulled, if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,
(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities,
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and
 
(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;
(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the non-payment of the principal, interest and additional interest, if any, of Securities of that series which has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513; and
(3) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Section 503. .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
The Company covenants that if:
(1) Default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such Default continues for a period of 30 days, or
(2) Default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
 
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.

Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case may be.

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents acceptable to the Company with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent
 
shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided that such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities in accordance with Section 301, with respect to any redemption of Securities at the election of the Company, unless, upon the giving of notice of such redemption, Defeasance shall have been effected with respect to such Securities pursuant to Section 1302, such notice may state that such redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt by the Trustee or the Paying Agent(s) for such Securities, on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption, of money sufficient to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities and that if such money shall not have been so received such notice shall be of no force or effect and the Company shall not be required to redeem such Securities. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption shall not be made and within a reasonable time thereafter notice shall be given, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not so received and such redemption was not required to be made, and the Trustee or Paying Agent(s) for the Securities otherwise to have been redeemed shall promptly return to the Holders thereof any of such Securities which had been surrendered for payment upon such redemption.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company, and any notice of non-satisfaction of redemption as aforesaid, shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. Subject to the preceding paragraph, any such notice of redemption shall be irrevocable.
Section 1105. .
Securities Payable on Redemption Date
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, and the conditions, if any, set forth in such notice having been satisfied, the Securities or portions thereof so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless, in the case of an unconditional notice of redemption, the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Securities or portions thereof, if interest-bearing, shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security or portion thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that no such surrender shall be a condition to such payment if so specified as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to such Security, and provided further that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.

Securities Redeemed in Part
 
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.

Section 1302. .
Defeasance and Discharge
The Company may cause itself to be discharged from its obligations with respect to any Securities or any series of Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Company's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003 and with respect to the Trustee under Section 607, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, Defeasance with respect to any Securities or any series of Securities by the Company is permitted under this Section 1302 notwithstanding the prior exercise by the Company of its rights under Section 1303 with respect to such Securities.

For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.

(5) In the case of an election under Section 1302, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that:
 
(A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or
(B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Defeasance had not occurred.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any money or Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1304 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, with respect to such Securities.
Section 1401. .
Indenture and Securities Solely Corporate Obligations
No recourse for the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in this Indenture or in any supplemental indenture, or in any Security, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any
 
incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that all such liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of the Securities.
Section 1501. .
Note Guarantees
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Article Fifteen, each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety, on a senior unsecured basis, to each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors, irrespective of (i) the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Securities or the obligations of the Company or any other Guarantors to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture and the Securities or (ii) the absence of any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or Default of a Guarantor, that: (a) the principal of, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any, with respect to the Securities shall be duly and punctually paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest or additional interest, if any, with respect to the Securities and all other obligations of the Company or any Guarantor to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture and the Securities (including amounts due the Trustee under Section 607) and all other obligations under this Indenture or the Securities shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and the Securities; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other obligation of the Company to the Holders, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of Default under this Indenture or the Securities shall constitute an event of default under this Note Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee to accelerate the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent as the obligations of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in relation to any Security that is convertible or exchangeable for other securities of the Company, a Guarantor's guaranteed obligations shall not extend, following the occurrence of a bankruptcy of the Company, to any amount in excess of principal of, premium, if any, interest and additional interest, if any, and interest on the overdue principal and (to the extent permitted by law) interest or additional interest, if any, with respect to such Securities.
(2) Each Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture, agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Indenture or the Securities, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions under this Indenture or the Securities, any release of any other Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same, whether or not a Note Guarantee is affixed to any particular Security, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture, waives the benefit of diligence,
 
presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that such Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities and this Indenture. The Note Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or to any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such Holder, a Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities and the Trustee, on the other hand, (a) subject to this Article Fifteen, the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 502 hereof and, as provided in an Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture establishing any series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 hereof, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 502 hereof, and as provided in an Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture establishing any series of Securities in accordance with Section 301 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of such Note Guarantee.
(3) Subject to Section 1506 hereof, the Note Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the obligations of the Guarantor, and the Note Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any of the obligations of the Guarantor is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder upon bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
(4) The Note Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against the Company for liquidation or reorganization, should the Company become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of the Company's assets, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Securities are pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee on the Securities, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent transfer" or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Securities shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
(5) No shareholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator, past, present or future, or any Guarantor, as such, shall have any personal liability under this Note Guarantee by reason of his, her or its status as such shareholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator.
(6) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that by virtue of its execution and delivery of this Indenture, it shall be deemed to have signed on each security issued hereunder a notation of the Note Guarantee.
 
(7) Each Guarantor hereby agrees to pay, in addition to the amount stated above, any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 1501.
Section 1502. .
Execution and Delivery of Indenture
To further evidence a Note Guarantee set forth in Section 1501, each Guarantor hereby agrees that this Indenture shall be executed by either manual or facsimile signature of an Officer of each Guarantor. The validity and enforceability of any Note Guarantee shall not be affected by the fact that it is not affixed to any particular Security.
Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in Section 1501 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Security a notation of such Note Guarantee.
If an Officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Securities or at any time thereafter, such Guarantor's Note Guarantee (pursuant to this Indenture) of such Security shall be valid nevertheless.
The delivery of the Securities of any series by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Note Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of such Guarantor.
Section 1503. .
Limitation of Note Guarantee
The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount as shall, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its Note Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Indenture, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under the Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similarly impermissible transaction under federal or state law. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Note Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in a pro rata amount based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in accordance with GAAP.
Section 1504. .
Additional Guarantors
If any Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor incurs any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owing to the Company or another Subsidiary or Non-Recourse Indebtedness), including any guarantee of any Indebtedness of the Company or a Subsidiary (other than a guarantee of Indebtedness owing to the Company or a Subsidiary), then the Company shall cause such Subsidiary to:
(1) execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall issue a Note Guarantee; and
(2) deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (which may contain customary exceptions) that such supplemental indenture and Note Guarantee have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such Subsidiary and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of such Subsidiary.
 
Thereafter, such Subsidiary shall be a Guarantor for all purposes of this Indenture. The Company may cause any other Subsidiary to issue a Note Guarantee and become a Guarantor. At any time all the Indebtedness and guarantees of Indebtedness of such Guarantor are repaid or released without further obligation by such Guarantor, such Guarantor need no longer be a Guarantor for purposes of this Section 1504, and the Trustee shall promptly execute such documents and instruments as the Company or such Guarantor may request to evidence the termination of such Note Guarantee.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this Section 1504 during any Suspension Period.
Section 1505. .
Guarantor May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
(1) Unless a Guarantor is released from its Note Guarantee as provided in Section 1506, such Guarantor may not (i) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into (whether or not the Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person or (ii) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets to another Person unless:
(A) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than such Guarantor or the Company) or the Person acquiring the property or assets in any such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee and this Indenture, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, on the terms set forth herein or therein; and
(B) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default exists.
(2) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, or conveyance or other disposition and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and reasonably satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for such Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as such Guarantor.
(3) Notwithstanding Section 1505(1), nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall prevent any consolidation or merger of any Guarantor with or into the Company, or shall prevent any sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property or assets of any Guarantor to the Company.
(4) Upon any consolidation of a Guarantor with, or merger of a Guarantor into, any other Person or any sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of a Guarantor in accordance with the foregoing, the successor Person formed by such consolidation or into which such Guarantor is merged or to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, such Guarantor under this Indenture and the Note Guarantee with the same effect as if such successor Person had been named as such Guarantor herein, and thereafter the predecessor Person, except in the case of a lease, shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Indenture and such Guarantor's Note Guarantee.
Section 1506. .
Release of Guarantor
(1) A Guarantor shall be released from all of its obligations under its Note Guarantee if:
 
(A) the Guarantor has sold or disposed of all of its assets (by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, plan of arrangement or otherwise) or the Company and its Subsidiaries have sold or disposed of all of the Equity Interests of the Guarantor owned by them, in each case in a transaction in compliance with the terms of this Indenture (including Section 1505); or
(B) the Guarantor merges with or into or consolidates with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, the Company or another Guarantor in a transaction in compliance with Section 1505;
provided that in each such case, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to such transactions have been complied with and that such release is authorized and permitted by this Indenture to evidence the release of the Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee.
(2) If all of the conditions to release contained in this Section 1506 have been satisfied, the Trustee, at the expense of the Company or Guarantor, shall execute any documents reasonably requested by the Company or any Guarantor in order to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee endorsed on the Securities and under this Article Fifteen.
Section 1507.
Waiver of Subrogation
Each Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture pursuant to this Article Fifteen, waives to the extent permitted by law any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under such Note Guarantee and this Indenture, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification, and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any Holder against the Company, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by the set-off or in any other manner, payment on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and the Securities shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Holders of the Securities, and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of such Holders to be credited and applied upon the Securities, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Guarantor, by execution of this Indenture pursuant to this Article Fifteen, shall acknowledge that it shall receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section 1507 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed all as of the day and year first above written.

Section 10.05 .
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
The Conversion Rate shall be subject to adjustment, without duplication, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
(A) If the Company issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 10.05(A) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or not to split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
(B) If the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than forty-five (45) calendar days from the record date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, options or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of shares of the Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Date for such distribution had not occurred.
In determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than such average of the Closing Sale Prices over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of the Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.05(B).
(C) In case the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its Indebtedness or other of its assets or property, other than (i) dividends or distributions covered by Section 10.05(A) and Section 10.05(B), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 10.05(C) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 10.05(C) called the ""), to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such distribution; that if "FMV" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "SP
provided
0
" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall receive on the date on which the Distributed Property is distributed to Holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines "FMV" for purposes of this Section 10.05(C) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Closing Sale Prices over the ten (10) consecutive Trading-Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Date for such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 10.05(C) where there has been a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the tenth (10
Spin-Off
th
) Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off will be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall become effective at the close of business on the tenth (10
th
) Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for the Spin-Off; that, for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the ten (10) Trading Days immediately following, and including, the Ex-Date for any Spin-Off, references in the portion of this Section 10.05(C) related to Spin-Offs to ten (10) Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Date for such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date for such conversion.
provided
For purposes of this Section 10.05(C), Section 10.05(A), and Section 10.05(B), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 10.05(C) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 10.05(B) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights, options or warrants to which Section 10.05(C) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 10.05(C) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, options or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 10.05(A) and Section 10.05(B) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Ex-Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Ex-Date," "the Ex-Date relating to such distribution of such rights, options or warrants" and "the Ex-Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 10.05(A) and Section 10.05(B) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be" within the meaning of Section 10.05(A) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution" within the meaning of Section 10.05(B).
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.05(C).
(D) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, excluding the first dividend or distribution with an Ex-Date in any calendar quarter if such dividend or distribution does not exceed $0.05 per share (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Dividend Threshold Amount
 
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution; that if "C" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "SP
provided
0
" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive on the date on which the relevant cash dividend or distribution is distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 10.05(D), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 10.05(D), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Closing Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such
 
reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.05(D).
(E) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock and the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
Such adjustment shall become effective at the close of business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, but excluding, the date such tender offer or exchange offer
 
expires; that, for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the ten (10) Trading Days immediately following, but excluding, the date that any such tender offer or exchange offer expires, references in this Section 10.05(E) to ten (10) Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of consecutive Trading Days as have elapsed between the date that such tender offer or exchange offer expires and the Conversion Date for such conversion. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all or any portion of such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that had been effected. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 10.05(E).
provided
(F) In addition to the foregoing adjustments in subsections (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E) above, the Company, from time to time and to the extent permitted by law and by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty (20) Business Days or such longer period as may be required by law, if the Board of Directors has made a determination, which determination shall be conclusive, that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company. Such Conversion Rate increase shall be irrevocable during such period. The Company shall give notice to the Trustee and cause notice of such increase to be mailed to each Holder of Notes at such Holder's address as the same appears on the registry books of the Registrar, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which such increase commences.
(G) Notwithstanding this Section 10.05 or any other provision of the Indenture or the Notes, if any Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective, or any Ex-Date for any issuance, dividend or distribution (relating to a required Conversion Rate adjustment) occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the open of business on a Conversion Date and ending on, and including, the close of business on the last Trading Day of the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period, the Board of Directors shall make adjustments to the Conversion Rate and the amount of cash or number of shares of Common Stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the Notes, as the case may be, as is be necessary or appropriate to effect the intent of this Section 10.05 and the other provisions of Article X and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 10.05(G) shall apply in lieu of the adjustment that would otherwise be applicable.
(H) The term "" (i) when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades the regular way on the relevant exchange or in the relevant market from which the Closing Sale Price was obtained without the right to receive such issuance or distribution, (ii) when used with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of Common Stock, means the first date on which the Common Stock trades the regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective, and (iii) when used with respect to any tender offer or exchange offer means the first date on

Guarantee
SECTION 2.02. . Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to any security held for the payment of the Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of the Borrower or any other person.
Guarantee of Payment
SECTION 2.03. . (a) Except for termination of a Guarantor's obligations hereunder as expressly provided for in Section 7.12, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by:
No Limitations, etc
(i) the failure of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to exercise or enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise;

(vi) any illegality, lack of validity or enforceability of any Obligation,
(vii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the Borrower or its assets or any resulting release or discharge of any Obligation,

(ix) and any other circumstance (including without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Collateral Agent that might otherwise constitute a defense to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, the Borrower or the Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.

SECTION 2.04. . Each Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or otherwise.
Reinstatement
SECTION 2.05. . In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Loan Party to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Collateral Agent for distribution to the applicable Secured Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid Obligation.

Information

Commercial Tort Claims
 
of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.
SECTION 4.05. . (a) Each Obligor agrees that it will not knowingly do any act or knowingly omit to do any act (and will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to prevent its licensees from doing any act or omitting to do any act) whereby any Patent that is material to the normal conduct of such Obligor's business may become prematurely invalidated or dedicated to the public.
Covenants Regarding Patent, Trademark and Copyright Collateral
(b) Each Obligor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, for each material Trademark necessary to the normal conduct of such Obligor's business, (i) maintain such Trademark in full force free from any adjudication of abandonment or invalidity for non-use, (ii) maintain the quality of products and services offered under such Trademark consistent with the quality of such products and services as of the date hereof, (iii) display such Trademark with notice of federal or foreign registration or claim of trademark or service mark as required under applicable law and (iv) not knowingly use or knowingly permit its licensees' use of such Trademark in violation of any third-party rights.
(c) Each Obligor will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, for each work covered by a material Copyright necessary to the normal conduct of such Obligor's business that it publishes, displays and distributes, use copyright notice as required under applicable copyright laws.
(d) Each Obligor shall notify the Collateral Agent promptly if it knows that any Patent, Trademark or Copyright material to the normal conduct of such Obligor's business may imminently become abandoned, lost or dedicated to the public other than by expiration, or of any materially adverse determination or development, excluding office actions and similar determinations in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright Office, any court or any similar office of any country, regarding such Obligor's ownership of any such material Patent, Trademark or Copyright or its right to register or to maintain the same.
(e) Each Obligor, either itself or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, shall (i) inform the Collateral Agent on a semi-annual basis of each application by itself, or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, for any Patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and each registration of any Trademark or Copyright with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any comparable office or agency in any other country filed during the preceding six-month period, and (ii) upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent, execute and deliver any and all agreements, instruments, documents and papers as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request to evidence the Collateral Agent's security interest in such Patent, Trademark or Copyright; for the avoidance of doubt, that all such Intellectual Property shall automatically constitute Collateral herewith.
provided
 
(f) Each Obligor shall exercise its reasonable business judgment consistent with its practice in any proceeding before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any comparable office or agency in any other country (A) with respect to maintaining and pursuing each material application relating to any Patent, Trademark and/or Copyright (and obtaining the relevant grant or registration) material to the normal conduct of such Obligor's business and (B) to maintain (i) each issued Patent and (ii) the registrations of each Trademark and each Copyright in each case that is material to the normal conduct of such Obligor's business, including, when applicable and necessary in such Obligor's reasonable business judgment, timely filings of applications for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of incontestability and payment of maintenance fees, and, if any Obligor believes necessary in its reasonable business judgment, to initiate opposition, interference and cancellation proceedings against third parties.
(g) In the event that any Obligor knows that any Article 9 Collateral consisting of a Patent, Trademark or Copyright material to the normal conduct of its business has been or is about to be materially infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Obligor shall, if such Obligor deems it necessary in its reasonable business judgment, promptly contact such third party, and if necessary in its reasonable business judgment, sue and recover damages, or take such other actions as are reasonably appropriate under the circumstances.
(h) Upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Obligor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all requisite consents or approvals from the licensor under each Copyright License, Patent License or Trademark License to effect the assignment of all such Obligor's right, title and interest thereunder to (in the Collateral Agent's sole discretion) the designee of the Collateral Agent or the Collateral Agent.
SECTION 5.01. . Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Obligor agrees to deliver each item of its Collateral to the Collateral Agent on demand, and it is agreed that the Collateral Agent shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Article 9 Collateral by the applicable Obligors to the Collateral Agent (, , that with respect to Trademarks such assignment shall only be effective if such Trademarks are accompanied by the goodwill symbolized by such Trademarks) or to license or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or a nonexclusive basis, any such Article 9 Collateral
Remedies Upon Default
provided
however
 
throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that waivers thereunder cannot be obtained) and (b) with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Article 9 Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Article 9 Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Article 9 Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the applicable Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Obligor agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any broker's board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized in connection with any sale of a security (if it deems it advisable to do so) pursuant to the foregoing to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who represent and agree that they are purchasing such security for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof. Upon consummation of any such sale of Collateral pursuant to this Section 5.01 the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely, free from any claim or right on the part of any Obligor, and each Obligor hereby waives and releases (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay, valuation and appraisal that such Obligor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted.
The Collateral Agent shall give the applicable Obligors 10 Business Days' written notice (which each Obligor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions) of the Collateral Agent's intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker's board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral, or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or the portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In the case of any sale of all or any part of the Collateral made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Collateral Agent shall not incur any liability in the event that any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in the case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon notice given in accordance with provisions above. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by
 
law, private) sale made pursuant to this Section 5.01, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase for cash, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of any Obligor (all such rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property in accordance with Section 5.02 hereof without further accountability to any Obligor therefor. For purposes hereof, a written agreement to purchase the Collateral or any portion thereof shall be treated as a sale thereof; the Collateral Agent shall be free to carry out such sale pursuant to such agreement and no Obligor shall be entitled to the return of the Collateral or any portion thereof subject thereto, notwithstanding the fact that after the Collateral Agent shall have entered into such an agreement all Events of Default shall have been remedied and the Obligations paid in full. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.01 shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in Section 9-610(b) of the New York UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
SECTION 5.02. . The Collateral Agent shall promptly apply the proceeds, moneys or balances of any collection or sale of Collateral, as well as any Collateral consisting of cash, as follows:
Application of Proceeds
FIRST, to the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the Applicable Agent and the Collateral Agent in connection with such collection or sale or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of its agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the Applicable Agent and the Collateral Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of any Obligor and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document;
SECOND, to the payment in full of the Obligations (the amounts so applied to be distributed among the Secured Parties in accordance with the respective amounts of the Obligations owed to them on the date of any such distribution); and
pro
rata
THIRD, to the Obligors, their successors or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
The Collateral Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any sale of Collateral by the Collateral Agent (including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Collateral Agent or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the purchaser or purchasers of the Collateral so sold and such purchaser or purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part
 
of the purchase money paid over to the Collateral Agent or such officer or be answerable in any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 5.03. . Solely for the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under Article V of this Agreement at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled, and to the extent necessary, to exercise such rights and remedies, each Obligor hereby grants to (in the Collateral Agent's sole discretion) a designee of the Collateral Agent or the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to any Obligor) to use, license or sublicense any of its Article 9 Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property (excluding Trademarks) now owned or hereafter acquired by such Obligor, wherever the same may be located, and including, without limitation, in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. The use of such license by the Collateral Agent (or its designee) may be exercised, at the option of the Collateral Agent, solely upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default; that any license, sublicense or other transaction entered into by the Collateral Agent in accordance herewith shall be binding upon the Obligors notwithstanding any subsequent cure of an Event of Default.
Grant of License To Use Intellectual Property
provided
SECTION 5.04. . In view of the position of the Obligors in relation to the Pledged Collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in effect, or any similar federal statute hereafter enacted analogous in purpose or effect (such Act and any such similar statute as from time to time in effect being called the "") with respect to any disposition of the Pledged Collateral permitted hereunder. Each Obligor understands that compliance with the Federal Securities Laws might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Collateral Agent if the Collateral Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Pledged Collateral, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Pledged Collateral could dispose of the same. Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Collateral Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Pledged Collateral under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar laws analogous in purpose or effect. Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that in light of such restrictions and limitations, the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, (a) may proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Pledged Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the Federal Securities Laws or, to the extent applicable, Blue Sky or other state securities laws and (b) may approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale. Each Obligor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions. In the event of any such sale, the Collateral Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Collateral at a price that the Collateral Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached. The provisions of
Securities Act, etc
Federal Securities Laws
 
this Section 5.04 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Collateral Agent sells.
SECTION 6.01. . In addition to all such rights of indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 6.03), the Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement in respect of any Obligation of the Borrower, the Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in the event any assets of any Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or any other Security Document to satisfy in whole or in part an Obligation of the Borrower, the Borrower shall indemnify such Guarantor in an amount equal to the greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.
Indemnity and Subrogation
SECTION 6.02. Contribution and Subrogation. Each Guarantor agrees (subject to Section 6.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any Obligation or assets of any other Guarantor shall be sold pursuant to any Security Document to satisfy any Obligation owed to any Secured Party and such other Guarantor (the "") shall not have been fully indemnified by the Borrower as provided in Section 6.01, the Contributing Guarantor shall indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such assets, as applicable, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the net worth of such Contributing Guarantor on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 7.13, the date of the supplement hereto executed and delivered by such Guarantor). Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under Section 6.01 to the extent of such payment.
Claiming Guarantor
SECTION 6.03. . (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Obligors under Sections 6.01 and 6.02 and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or subrogation of the Obligors under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations. No failure on the part of the Borrower or any Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 6.01 and 6.02 (or any other payments required under applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Obligor with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Obligor shall remain liable for the full amount of the obligations of such Obligor hereunder.
Subordination
 
(b) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that all Indebtedness and other monetary obligations owed by it to any other Guarantor or any Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligations.
SECTION 7.01. . All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement. All communications and notices hereunder to any Guarantor shall be given to it in care of the Borrower, with such notice to be given as provided in Section 9.01 of the Credit Agreement.
Notices
SECTION 7.02. . All rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Security Interest, the security interest in the Pledged Collateral and all obligations of each Obligor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee, securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Obligations or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Obligor in respect of the Obligations or this Agreement.
Security Interest Absolute
SECTION 7.03. . This Agreement shall become binding when a counterpart hereof shall have been executed by the Borrower, the Guarantors and the Collateral Agent and when the Collateral Agent shall have received copies thereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and the other Secured Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be construed as a separate agreement with respect to each party and may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived or released with respect to any party without the approval of any other party and without affecting the obligations of any other party hereunder.
Binding Effect; Several Agreement
SECTION 7.04. . The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and registered assigns, except that no party shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein or in the Collateral (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly contemplated by the Credit Agreement.
Successors and Assigns
 
SECTION 7.05. . (a) The parties hereto agree that the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to reimbursement of its expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement.
Collateral Agent's Fees and Expenses; Indemnification
(b) Without limitation of its indemnification obligations under the other Loan Documents, each Obligor jointly and severally agrees to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the other Indemnitees (as defined in Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, litigation, investigations or proceedings and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted or brought against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto and thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of any transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, or to the Collateral, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, litigation, investigations or proceedings or related expenses result primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Related Parties (any such Indemnitee and its Related Parties treated, for this purpose only, as a single Indemnitee).
provided
(c) Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Obligations secured hereby and by the other Security Documents. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreements contained herein, the provisions of this Section 7.05 shall survive the payment in full of the principal and interest under the Credit Agreement, the expiration of the Letters of Credit, the termination of the Commitments and the termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document. All amounts due under this Section 7.05 shall be payable on written demand therefor.
SECTION 7.06. . Each Obligor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent the attorney-in-fact of such Obligor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agent's name or in the name of such Obligor, (a) to receive, endorse, assign or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to ask for, demand, sue for, collect, receive and give acquittance for any and all moneys due or to become due under and by virtue of any Collateral; (d) to sign the name of any Obligor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (e) to send verifications of Accounts to any Account Debtor; (f) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law
Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact
 
or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (g) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; (h) to notify, or to require any Obligor to notify, Account Debtors to make payment directly to the Collateral Agent; and (i) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes; , that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Collateral Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Obligor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
provided
SECTION 7.07. . The terms of Sections 9.07, 9.11 and 9.15 of the Credit Agreement are incorporated herein by reference, , and the parties hereto agree to such terms.
Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
mutatis mutandis
SECTION 7.08. . (a) No failure or delay of the Agents, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, each Issuing Bank and other Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on the Borrower or any other Loan Party in any case shall entitle such person to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

SECTION 7.10. . This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 7.03. Delivery of an executed counterpart to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed original.

In the event that any action is required to evidence the Collateral Release, the Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to take any such action, including the execution and delivery of such documents, as any Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence such release subject to the Collateral Agent's receipt of a certification by the Borrower stating that a Ratings Event has occurred.
