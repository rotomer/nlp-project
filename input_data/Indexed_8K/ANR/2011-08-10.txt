Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
 
On August 4, 2011, Dickenson-Russell Coal Company, LLC (Dickenson-Russell), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that a foreman was observed traveling under unsupported roof at the Roaring Fork No. 4 Mine.  No injuries occurred, and the order did not require withdrawal of miners from the mine.
 
Dickenson-Russell has a safety policy which prohibits entry into areas of unsupported roof, and the company has received no prior citations or orders alleging that miners have entered such areas of the Roaring Fork No. 4 Mine.  Dickenson-Russell does not believe that the use of a 107(a) order was the appropriate response to an individual employees unintentional entry into an area of unsupported roof and intends to challenge the order before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission.
 
MSHA personnel cautioned the foreman not to enter areas of unsupported roof, and the order has been terminated.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
