, August 22, 2011 -
The new $600 million authorization is in addition to the existing $125 million repurchase authorization announced in May of 2010, under which approximately $108 million has been used to repurchase approximately 3.2 million shares at an average price of $33.74 per share through August 19, 2011.  Approximately $17 million remains available for repurchases under the existing $125 million authorization.
This new repurchase authorization affirms Alphas long-standing commitment to maximizing shareholder value, said Kevin Crutchfield, Alphas chief executive officer.  Throughout its history, Alpha has been focused on operational excellence, thoughtful growth, and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet and an appropriate capital structure.  Executing on our strategic plan, Alpha has emerged from the recent acquisition of Massey with a premier reserve base that positions us as a leading global supplier of metallurgical coal, a sound balance sheet and ample liquidity.  With todays announcement, Alpha will continue to be able to deploy a portion of its capital and expected future free cash flows to fine tune our capital structure and return cash to shareholders while at the same time continuing to focus on successful integration and operational execution following the acquisition.
