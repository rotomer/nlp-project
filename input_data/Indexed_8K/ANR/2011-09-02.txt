Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of a notice of the potential to have a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
 
On August 30, 2011, Support Mining Company d/b/a Inman Coal (Inman) and Independence Coal Company, Inc. (Independence), subsidiaries of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (Alpha), received written notice from MSHA alleging that Inmans Randolph Mine and Independences Justice #1 Mine have the potential to have a pattern of violations (PPOV) under section 104(e) of the Mine Act.
 
The PPOV notices are based on citations and orders issued by MSHA to Inman and Independence during the twelve month period from September 1, 2009 through August 31, 2010.  Inman and Independence disagree with and intend to challenge the issuance of such notices because (i) many of the citations and orders on which the notices are based have been contested and should not be included in the PPOV screening process because they are not final orders of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, and (ii) MSHA has failed to follow its procedural policy which states:
There may be extraordinary occasions when a mine meets the screening criteria by which mines are identified as exhibiting a potential pattern of violations but there are mitigating circumstances that make a potential pattern notification inappropriate.  Examples of situations that would be necessary to justify not issuing a PPOV notification are:  Recent bona fide changes in mine ownership or management.
On June 1, 2011, Alpha acquired Massey Energy Company (Massey), the ultimate parent of Inman and Independence.  Since the change in ownership, significant management changes have been made at both mines.
 
Inman and Independence also intend to fully analyze the nature and type of the subject citations and orders issued during Masseys ownership, and use that analysis as the basis for developing a written plan for corrective action at their respective mines.
