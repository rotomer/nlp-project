Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
 
On September 13, 2011, Elk Run Coal Company, Inc. (Elk Run), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that a continuous miner operator was observed walking along the side of the continuous miner while tramming the machine between pillar blocks at the Hunter Peerless Mine.  No injuries occurred, and the order did not require withdrawal of miners from the mine.
 
Elk Run has a safety policy which prohibits persons from entering the areas along either side of the continuous mining machine while it is being trammed anywhere in the mine.  Elk Run has retrained all miners working at the Hunter Peerless Mine on its safety policy, and the order has been terminated.
