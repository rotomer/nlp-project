Exhibit 99.1
 
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR), a leading U.S. coal producer, today updated its full year 2011 shipment guidance to a range of 102.5 million tons to 109.5 million tons compared to the previous range of 104 million tons to 112 million tons.  The decrease is primarily attributable to four factors: reduced metallurgical export shipments to Asia due to unexpectedly curtailed customer activity levels; a force majeure notice from an export metallurgical customer; lower than expected production from the Emerald longwall mine; and lower than expected production volumes from certain legacy Massey mines in Central Appalachia.
ABINGDON, Va., September 21, 2011
Alpha now anticipates 2011 Eastern metallurgical coal shipments should range from 18.5 million tons to 20.5 million tons, compared to the previous range of 19.0 million tons to 21.0 million tons.  Shipments of Eastern thermal coal are now expected to range from 36.0 million tons to 39.0 million tons, compared to the previous range of 37.0 million tons to 41.0 million tons.  Shipment guidance for Alphas Western operations in the Powder River Basin remains unchanged.  The majority of the reduction in Alphas Eastern metallurgical coal shipment guidance range and approximately half of the reduction in Alphas Eastern thermal coal shipment range are related to shipment levels achieved in July and August of 2011, with the remainder spread throughout the balance of the year.
Primarily as a result of reduced production and shipment forecasts, Alpha now expects that its adjusted Eastern cost of coal sales per ton for 2011 should range from $73 to $76 excluding the influence of , with higher adjusted cost of coal sales during the third quarter in the range of $77 to $79 per ton, declining as volumes lift in the fourth quarter.  Guidance for the Western cost of coal sales per ton for 2011 remains unchanged.  Alpha is currently reviewing its 2012 estimates and global market conditions.  In conjunction with Alphas annual budgeting process, the Company plans to refine its 2012 outlook, as appropriate, when the company reports its third quarter 2011 financial results.
