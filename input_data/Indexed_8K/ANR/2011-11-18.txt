Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
 
On November 14, 2011, Alex Energy, Inc. (Alex Energy), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that the grade of a portion of a haul road at the North Surface Mine was too steep.  The order alleged that a portion of the roadway exceeded the maximum grade recommended by the manufacturer of certain rock trucks using the road.  No injuries occurred as a result of the cited condition, and Alex Energy removed the trucks and a loader from the subject portion of the roadway.
 
The order was terminated on November 14, 2011.
