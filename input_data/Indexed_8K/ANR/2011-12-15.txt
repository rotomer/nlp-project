Item 8.01 Other Events
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted.  Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Act contains a reporting requirement regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act), issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).
 
On December 9, 2011, Cloverlick Coal Company LLC, a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that its Mine No. 1 had encountered adverse mine roof conditions referred to as hill seams and mountain breaks, which would be an imminent danger in the affected area if normal mining continues in [that] direction.
 
No injuries occurred as a result of the cited condition, and the order was terminated on December 13, 2011.
