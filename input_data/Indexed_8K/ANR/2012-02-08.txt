Item 1.04 Mine Safety  Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violation
On February 2, 2012, Marfork Coal Company, Inc. (Marfork), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that a miner had been observed entering an area of unsupported roof at the Slip Ridge Cedar Grove Mine (the Mine) located near Whitesville, West Virginia.  No injuries occurred, no hazardous conditions were cited, and the order did not require withdrawal of miners from the mine.
 
Marfork has a safety policy which prohibits entry into areas of unsupported roof.  Mine personnel have reviewed that policy with the Mines workforce, and the order has been terminated.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
