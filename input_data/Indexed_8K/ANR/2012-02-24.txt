Item 1.04 Mine Safety  Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violation
On February 17, 2012, Cloverlick Coal Company LLC (Cloverlick), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that the threat of falling rock and sliding earth from a hillside adjacent to a retaining wall construction site prevented safe access to the site, which is on the surface area of Cloverlicks Mine No. 1 (the Mine), an underground mine located near Cumberland, Kentucky.  The retaining wall was being constructed for Cloverlick by an independent contractor, and Cloverlicks employees were not exposed to the condition cited.  No injuries occurred, no miners were observed in the area and the order did not require withdrawal of miners from underground.
 
Cloverlicks independent contractor has backfilled and secured the area, and the order has been terminated.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
