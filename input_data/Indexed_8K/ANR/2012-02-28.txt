Item 1.04 Mine Safety  Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violation
On February 23, 2012, Brooks Run Mining Company, LLC (Brooks Run), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that a miner at the Cucumber Mine (the Mine), located near War, West Virginia, was observed operating a mechanized scoop by walking along side of it and activating the controls by reaching into the operators compartment.  Brooks Run has a safety policy which prohibits the cited behavior.  No injuries occurred, and the order did not require withdrawal of miners from underground.
 
Brooks Run has retrained all miners working at the Mine regarding its safety policy, and the order has been terminated.
