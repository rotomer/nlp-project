Item 1.04 Mine Safety  Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violation
On February 27, 2012, Cumberland Coal Resources, LP (Cumberland), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act due to methane levels detected at the Cumberland Mine (the Mine), located near Waynesburg, PA, and requiring withdrawal of the miners, except those needed to conduct required examinations and maintain water pumps in the Mine.  On February 28, 2012, the order was modified to release all areas of the Mine other than the longwall section.  No injuries occurred as a result of the cited condition.
 
Methane levels in the Mine have been reduced, and the order has been terminated.
