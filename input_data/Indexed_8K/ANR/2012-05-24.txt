Item 1.04 Mine Safety  Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violation
On May 18, 2012, Spartan Mining Company, a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that smoke was encountered in the Road Fork #51 Mine (the Mine), located near Pineville, WV, and requiring withdrawal of the miners, except certified foremen necessary to locate the source of the smoke.  A slipping conveyor belt was promptly identified as the source and repaired.  No fire was discovered, and all air readings indicated that no fire or combustion had occurred in the Mine.  The order was subsequently terminated on May 21, 2012.  No injuries occurred as a result of the cited condition.
