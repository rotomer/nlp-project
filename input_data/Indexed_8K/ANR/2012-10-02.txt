Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Underwriting Agreement
On September 28, 2012, Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. ("Alpha") and certain of Alpha's wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on behalf of themselves and the other underwriters named in Schedule II thereto (collectively, the "Underwriters"), to issue and sell to the Underwriters $500 million aggregate principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2018 (the "Senior Notes"). Alpha estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes will be approximately $479.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Alpha intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the purchase price of up to $350 million of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (the "3.25% Convertible Notes") issued by Alpha Appalachia Holdings, Inc. (formerly Massey Energy Company) ("Alpha Appalachia"), which are tendered and accepted by Alpha for purchase in the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation, including the payment of applicable premiums. Any remaining net proceeds from this offering, including if the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation is not consummated, are intended to be used for general corporate purposes.
The sale of the Senior Notes was made pursuant to Alpha's registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-165473) (the "Registration Statement") previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including the prospectus dated March 15, 2010, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated September 27, 2012, filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b).
The Underwriting Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants by Alpha customary for agreements of this nature. It also provides for customary indemnification by each of Alpha and the Underwriters against certain liabilities arising out of, or in connection with, the sale of the Senior Notes and customary contribution provisions in respect of those liabilities. The sale of the Senior Notes is expected to close on October 11, 2012.
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is a summary and is not meant to be a complete description of this agreement. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1, and incorporated by reference into this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Registration Statement.
The Underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Underwriters and certain of their affiliates have engaged in, are engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Alpha or its affiliates, including the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2011, by and among Alpha, Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, the guarantors party thereto and the other parties thereto (the "Credit Agreement), and Alpha's commitments with respect thereto. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commission for these transactions. Affiliates of certain of the Underwriters are lenders and/or agents under our Credit Agreement. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the issuer. Such investments and securities activity may involve securities and instruments of the issuer, including the 3.25% Convertible Notes, and therefore, the Underwriters and/or their respective affiliates may indirectly receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. The Underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as dealer managers in the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation, for which they will receive customary fees.

Covenants of the Underwriters
8. .
Indemnity and Contribution
(a) Each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any documented and out-of-pocket legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any road show as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act not constituting an issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based Underwriter Information.
 
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each Guarantor, their affiliates, directors, members or partners, their officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and Guarantors to such Underwriter, but only with reference to Underwriter Information in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus, prospectus, any road show, or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Manager authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its prior written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 business days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and, (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantors or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
(e) The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the Guarantors contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, the Guarantors, their officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or the Guarantors and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
(g) The name of the Underwriters and the statements set forth in the third and fifteenth paragraphs under the heading "Underwriting" in the Time of Sale Prospectus (to the extent such statements relate to the Underwriters) constitute the only information (the "") furnished by the Underwriters to the Issuers for the purposes of this Agreement.
Underwriter Information
9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have
Termination
 
been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Underwriters' Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Underwriters' Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Underwriters' Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Underwriters' Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Underwriters' Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Underwriters' Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Underwriters' Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
provided
 
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their one counsel and any reasonably necessary local counsel) incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
11. .
Entire Agreement
(a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering of Securities, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
(b) The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company, the Guarantors or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company and the Guarantors only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors.
