15 Global Cutbacks Impacting Met Market Sources: Company announcements, internal analysis Announced Global Met Coal Reductions Up to ~30 million tonnes U.S. - Appalachia U.S. - Appalachia Australia Australia U.S. - Appalachia U.S. - Appalachia U.S. - Appalachia Mongolia U.S. - Appalachia United Kingdom U.S. - Appalachia Producer Location  The global metallurgical coal market weakened throughout the first nine months of 2012  Q4 benchmark of $170/tonne FOBT fell sharply from $225/tonne in Q3  Current reports indicate spot pricing below the $170 benchmark, but off lows  Alpha believes recent spot pricing in the ~$150/tonne range is below production costs for between 1/3 and 1/2 of global production  Producers in most major production regions, including the U.S., Canada and Australia, have announced production cutbacks of up to 30MTs, more than 10% of the seaborne market  This supply response is expected to bring the market back into balance in the near-term
 
16  Overall U.S. domestic thermal market remains challenged  Unusually mild 2011/2012 winter resulted in low coal burn and high inventories, which remain elevated at approximately 190 million tons as of September 30  Competition from low-priced shale gas has reduced coals market share  Aggressive regulation creates uncertainty for utilities, drives plant retirements & fuel switching CAPP Steam Facing Structural Challenges Structural  Regulation  Permitting  High operating costs  Deteriorating geology  Plant retirements Cyclical  Mild winter 2011/2012  Competition from low-priced natural gas  High inventory levels  NAPP and PRB coals were negatively impacted by cyclical challenges, primarily mild winter in 2011/2012 and subsequent competition from low priced natural gas  While inventories are still above normal levels at PRB and NAPP, these regions are now competitive against natural gas at current natural gas prices Central Appalachian Steam Challenges
 
17  When natural gas prices bottomed below $2/MCF, fuel switching drove coal to 32% of U.S. generation  Coal has recently risen to 39% of U.S. generation as spot gas prices have climbed into the mid $3s  Contango in forward gas prices suggests that coal usage may rise further as more switching reverses  As rigs are shifted to liquids plays and existing shale wells decline (~80% 1st year production decline in many), injection rates should fall  suggesting a positive impact on future pricing Nat Gas Rebound Drives Thermal Coal Use Natural Gas, Fuel Switching Trends Favor U.S. Thermal Coal Rig Count Declining Gas Prices vs. Injection Rates 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 Dec-07 Sep-08 Jun-09 Mar-10 Dec-10 Sep-11 Jun-12 R ig s Oil and Gas Rig Count Oil Gas Sources: EIA and Baker Hughes $1.50 $2.50 $3.50 $4.50 $5.50 $6.50 (6.0) (4.0) (2.0) - 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 J a n -0 9 Ma y -0 9 S e p -0 9 J a n -1 0 Ma y -1 0 S e p -1 0 J a n -1 1 Ma y -1 1 S e p -1 1 J a n -1 2 Ma y -1 2 S e p -1 2 B C F/da y Quarterly Injection Rate Beyond Normal (BCF/day) HH Gas Price ($/mmBtu)

24 Reconciliation Use of Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) provided throughout this press release, Alpha has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses to gauge operating performance: EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per common share, adjusted cost of coal sales per ton, adjusted coal margin per ton and adjusted weighted average coal margin per ton. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude various items detailed in the attached Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss) and Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) to Net Income (Loss). The definition of these non-GAAP measures may be changed periodically by management to adjust for significant items important to an understanding of operating trends. These measures are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, they are presented as supplemental measures of the Companys performance that management believes are useful to securities analysts, investors and others in assessing the Companys performance over time. Moreover, these measures are not calculated identically by all companies and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each of these measures to its most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below.

27 Key Regulations and Legislation Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and Utility MACT (MATS) are the primary regulations that will shape the future of coal-fired generation in the US  Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) stayed December 30, 2011 by D.C. Circuit court & CAIR reinstated  EPA requested an en banc rehearing in early October  MATS rule finalized December 21, 2011  Compliance by 1Q15; additional time possible on an exception basis  Establishes first ever limits for mercury, filterable PM, and HCl  Provisions of the rule impacting new sources reconsidered by EPA and sent to OMB for review on 11/7/12  For both rules, in general, most will have to install costly scrubbers driving up power prices  Activated Carbon Injection (ACI) is the most common and effective technology to capture the air toxins for MATS  Scrubbers typically take 4-5 years to build  New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) sets a national limit for CO2 emissions from new electric generating units (EGUs)  Proposal issued March 27, 2012; Rule expected to be finalized in late 2012 or early 2013  EPA required under 2010 settlement agreement to also set GHG NSPS for existing sources  A number of additional coal-related Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations are expected to be promulgated in 2013-2014 Source: Internal analysis
