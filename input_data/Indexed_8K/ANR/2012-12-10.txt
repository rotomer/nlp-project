Item 1.04 Mine Safety  Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violation
On December 4, 2012, Rockspring Development, Inc. (Rockspring), a subsidiary of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., received an imminent danger order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act) to the Camp Creek Processing Plant (the Plant), located near East Lynn, West Virginia. The order alleged that an explosive mixture of methane and oxygen was present inside a 12 x 15 structure that houses a dewatering pump, which is in an isolated area away from the work sites of the Plant. Subsequent MSHA inspections showed no explosive mixture present in the pump house.
On December 5, 2012, Rockspring received an imminent danger order issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that an explosive mixture of methane and oxygen was present in the sealed areas of the Camp Creek Mine (the Mine), also near East Lynn, West Virginia. Upon investigation, MSHA determined that an explosive mixture was not present in the sealed areas of the Mine and that the order had been issued in error. Accordingly, the order was vacated on December 5, 2012.
No injuries occurred as a result of the conditions cited.
