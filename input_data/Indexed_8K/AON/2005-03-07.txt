Item 1.01.  Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 4, 2005, Aon Corporation ("Aon") and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the "Company") entered into an agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Illinois Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (collectively, the "State Agencies") to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the State Agencies.
 
The material terms of the Settlement Agreement are as follows:
 
1.
              
The Company will pay $190 million into a fund (the "Fund") to be distributed to certain eligible policyholder clients.  These payments are in full satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Settlement Agreement and the State Agencies have agreed not to impose any other financial obligation or liability on the Company related to the lawsuits.  No portion of the payments by the Company is considered a fine or penalty.  The Company will make payments into the Fund as follows:
 
 - 
                 
On or before September 1, 2005, the Company shall pay $76 million into the Fund.
 
 - 
                 
On or before September 1, 2006, the Company shall pay $76 million into the Fund.
 
 - 
                 
On or before September 1, 2007, the Company shall pay $38 million into the Fund.
 
2.
              
The Fund, plus interest, will be used to compensate the Company's eligible policyholder clients according to procedures set out in the Settlement Agreement.  No amount paid to the Fund will be returned to Aon under any circumstances.
 
3.
              
On or before June 30, 2005, the Company will calculate, in accordance with a formula approved by the State Agencies, the amount that each policyholder client is eligible to receive from the Fund.  Clients eligible to participate in the Fund are those U.S. clients that engaged the Company to place, renew, consult on or service insurance with inception or renewal dates between January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2004 (the "Relevant Period") where such placement, renewal, consultation or servicing resulted in contingent commissions or overrides recorded by Aon during the Relevant Period (the "Eligible Policyholders").
 
4.
              
On or before June 30, 2005, the Company must send a notice to each Eligible Policyholder setting forth, among other things, the amount it will be paid from the Fund if it elects to participate (a "Participating Policyholder").  Participating Policyholders must tender a release of claims against the Company arising from acts, omissions, transactions or conduct that are the subject of the lawsuits.
 
5.
              
On November 30, 2005, September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007, each Participating Policyholder shall receive from the Fund as much of that Participating Policyholder's aggregate share of the Fund as possible with the monies then available in the Fund.
 
6.
              
In the event that an Eligible Policyholder elects not to participate or otherwise does not respond by October 30, 2005 (a "Non-Participating Policyholder"), that client's allocated share may be used by the Company to satisfy any pending or other claims asserted by clients relating to the matters covered by the Settlement Agreement.  In no event shall a distribution be made from the Fund to any other client until all Participating Policyholders have been paid, nor shall total payments to any Non-Participating Policyholder exceed 80% of that policyholder's original allocated share.  If
any funds remain in the Fund as of October 1, 2007 such funds shall be distributed pro rata to the Participating Policyholders by November 1, 2007.
 
7.
              
In no event shall any of the amounts paid into the Fund be used to pay attorneys' fees.
 
8.
              
Within 60 days of the date of the Settlement Agreement, the Company shall commence the implementation of certain business reforms, including the following:
 
 - 
                 
To accept only a specific fee to be paid by the client, a specific percentage commission on premium to be paid by an insurer set at the time of purchase, renewal, placement or servicing of an insurance policy, or a combination of both.
 
 - 
                 
To fully disclose in plain, unambiguous written language commissions in either dollars or percentage amounts.
 
 - 
                 
Not to accept any other valuable compensation or consideration from an insurer other than as stated above, including contingent compensation and any compensation or preference in connection with the selection of insurers from which to solicit bids for clients.
 
 - 
                 
Not to request or accept from any insurer any false, fictitious or inflated quote, or quote that does not represent the insurers' best evaluation at the time of the minimum premium the insurer would require to bind the insurance coverage sought by the client.
 
 - 
                 
Not to request or accept from any insurer any promise or commitment for the use of our services, including reinsurance brokerage, conditioned upon any arrangement to provide preferential treatment for any insurer.
 
 - 
                 
Not to place, renew or service a client's business through a wholesale broker unless agreed to by the client after full disclosure of all the compensation to be received, any interest we may have in the wholesale broker, and any alternative to using the wholesaler broker.
 
 - 
                 
To fully disclose to each client all quotes received in connection with coverage of the client's risk with all terms and all commissions to be received for each quote, and to provide disclosure of and obtain clients written consent to all compensation arrangements.
 
 - 
                 
To disclose to each client at the end of each year all compensation received during the preceding year from any insurer or third party in connection with the client's policy.
 
 - 
                 
To implement company-wide written standards of conduct regarding compensation from insurers consistent with the terms of the settlement and institute appropriate training of employees, including business ethics, professional obligations, conflicts of interest, antitrust and trade practices compliance and record keeping.
 
 - 
                 
To establish a Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors that will monitor our compliance with the standards of conduct regarding compensation.
 
 - 
                 
To maintain a record of all complaints regarding compensation from any insurer, and provide such record to the Compliance Committee.
 
 - 
                 
To file annual reports with New York and Illinois for five years.
 
9.
              
The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, seek or accept indemnification pursuant to any insurance policy or other reimbursement with respect to any amounts payable under the Settlement Agreement.

1.                             Aon shall pay $190,000,000 into a fund (the "Fund") over the next thirty months in three payments to be paid to Aon's policyholder clients who retained Aon to place, renew, consult on or service insurance where such placement resulted in contingent commissions or overrides.

Nothing herein shall preclude Aon from accepting or requesting any bona fide quote or indication.

WHEREFORE, the following signatures are affixed hereto on this 4th day of March, 2005.
 
As these investigations have revealed, Aon and other insurance brokers and consultants entered into contingent commission agreements and other arrangements that created conflicts of interest. I deeply regret that we took advantage of those conflicts. This conduct violated the longstanding principle embodied in our Code of Conduct and Aon's Values Statement that our clients must always come first. Such conduct was improper and I apologize for it.
Aon believes that these investigations have done the industry a great service. Aon looks forward to working with regulators, insureds, insurance companies, and other stakeholders to put in place new business practices for the entire industry that eliminate the improper practices exposed by these investigations.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Aon Settles Investigations By Five Agencies In Three States
 
 Aon Corporation (NYSE: AOC) has reached a comprehensive agreement with five agencies in three states to settle investigations relating to contingent commissions and other business practices that may have created actual or potential conflicts of interest.
CHICAGO, IL, March 4, 2005
 
Parties involved in the settlement, in which Aon admits no wrongdoing or liability, include the attorneys general of New York, Illinois and Connecticut as well as the insurance departments of New York and Illinois.  The settlement involves no fines or penalties.
 
Elements of the comprehensive agreement include:
 
Creation of a $190 million fund to provide compensation to eligible U.S. clients with policies incepted or renewed between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2004.
 - 
                 
Commitment to new business practices that include heightened disclosure of remuneration and the elimination of practices that may have posed conflicts of interest.
 - 
                 
Establishment of a Compliance Committee of the Aon Board of Directors.
 - 
                 
 
Under the terms of the settlement, Aon will be contacting U.S. policyholders who may be eligible for payments from the fund.  The size of the payments will be calculated with a formula approved by other parties to the settlement.  Additional information about the fund will be available on Aon's web site (www.aon.com).
 
Patrick G. Ryan, Aon chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Aon now has these investigations behind us and can move forward with renewed focus on our clients.   We are enhancing policies, practices and controls; setting new, higher standards for service excellence; and re-energizing our commitment to safeguarding the trust that clients put in our 48,000 people every day."
 
Mr. Ryan added, "While we do not agree with a number of allegations in the complaints, the settlement permits us to look to the future.  I believe that the business reforms emerging from these investigations establish a model that can be  and should be  embraced by the whole industry.  Clients have every right to expect transactions that are transparent and free of even any appearance of conflicts of interests."
 
The settlement included a statement by Mr. Ryan in which he apologized and acknowledged that some Aon personnel engaged in improper conduct that violated the principles embodied in Aon's Code of Conduct and Aon Values.   However, Aon reaffirmed its previous statements that its internal review had found no evidence of price fixing, bid rigging or the solicitation of fictitious quotes.  In addition, there is no evidence of the antitrust offense of tying, and the complaints did not include such allegations.
 
Aon has previously announced that it would eliminate contingent commissions effective after October 1, 2004.  The elimination of contingent commissions was also an element of the settlement agreement.

Aon has established a reserve of $180 million, representing the present value of the $190 million settlement amount.  The settlement will be funded in three installments.  Separately, Aon has established a $40 million reserve in connection with related litigation matters. The financial impact of these actions is approximately $0.32 cents per diluted share, net of the previously booked reserves of $50 million, and will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
The company has scheduled an 11 a.m. CST (Friday, March 4) investment community teleconference to review the settlement and its financial implications.  The teleconference will also be accessible via webcast through www.aon.com.

These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results, depending on a variety of factors.  Potential factors that could impact results include the general economic conditions in different countries around the world, fluctuations in global equity and fixed income markets, exchange rates, rating agency actions, resolution of pending regulatory investigations and related issues, including those related to compensation arrangements with underwriters, pension funding, ultimate paid claims may be different from actuarial estimates and actuarial estimates may change over time, changes in commercial property and casualty markets and commercial premium rates, the competitive environment, the actual costs of resolution of contingent liabilities and other loss contingencies, and the heightened level of potential errors and omissions liability arising from placements of complex policies and sophisticated reinsurance arrangements in an insurance market in which insurer reserves are under pressure.  Further information concerning the Company and its business, including factors that potentially could materially affect the Company's financial results, is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
