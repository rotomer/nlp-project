Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On October 24, 2005, Aon Corporation (the "Company") and certain of its foreign subsidiaries entered into a transfer and amendment agreement (the "Amendment") relating to its 650 million multi-currency revolving loan credit facility (as amended by the Amendment, the "Eurofacility").
 
The Amendment extends the term of each revolving loan facility available under the Eurofacility to five years from the date of the Amendment, with an option to extend each such facility for two additional one-year periods.  As a result, the Eurofacility will mature on October 24, 2010, unless so extended.
 
In addition, among other things, the Amendment: (i) eliminates the requirement that a representation regarding material adverse change be made at the time of each borrowing request and on the first day of each interest period; (ii) deletes certain covenants with respect to acquisitions and investments; and (iii) revises certain covenants, including those with respect to mergers and dispositions.
 
The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is filed herewith and incorporated herein by reference.

(b)
                                 
you acknowledge that, due to the fact that interest payable under the Agreement is to be calculated on a floating rate basis by references to LIBOR or EURIBOR for Interest Periods selected by a Borrower, it is not possible to compute the effective global rate ("taux effectif global") for the lifetime of the Facilities; and
 
(c)
                                  
in order to comply with the provisions of Articles L313-1 and L313-2 of the French "Code de la Consommation", and only as an indication based on the assumptions described below, an example of calculation of the effective global rate can be given as follows:
 
(i)
                                 
for an Interest Period of three months and at  EURIBOR rate of [                   ] per annum, a rate for the Facilities () of [                   ] per cent.;
taux de priode
 
(ii)
                              
for an Interest Period of six months and at  LIBOR rate of [                   ] per annum, a rate for the Facilities () of [                   ] per cent.
taux de priode
 
The above rates are given on an indicative basis and on the basis (a) that drawdown for the full amount of the Facilities will occur on the date hereof and will remain outstanding for the lifetime of the Facility, (b) that the EURIBOR/LIBOR rate, expressed as an annual rate, is as fixed on [] October 2005 and (c) that repayments occur at contractual maturity and not earlier and (d) that the Debt Rating Level of the Company is Level [                   ].  Such rates shall not be binding on the Arranger, the Agent or a Lender.
