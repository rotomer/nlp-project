Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
On February 9, 2006, Aon Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release (the "Press Release") announcing its results of operations for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2005.
 
A copy of the Press Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
(a)(b)          Not applicable.
 
(c)           Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
- Aon Corporation (NYSE: AOC) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2005 results.
CHICAGO, IL  February 9, 2006
 
Net income was $224 million or $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $81 million or $0.24 per share in 2004.  Fourth quarter 2005 net income from continuing operations increased 97% to $144 million or $0.42 per share compared to $73 million or $0.22 per share a year ago.
 
Net income for the full year of $737 million increased 35% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $2.17 was up 33%.  Full year 2005 net income from continuing operations increased to $642 million or $1.89 per share from $545 million or $1.63 per share in 2004.
 
Excluding certain items that influenced the fourth quarter and full year results (as detailed in the attached supplemental schedules), net income per share from continuing operations was $0.67 and $2.21 for the fourth quarter and twelve months 2005, respectively.
 
Greg Case, Aon's president and CEO, said, "Our fourth quarter operating results show strong underlying margin improvement.  Americas Brokerage, led by our U.S. and Latin America Retail businesses, showed very solid organic growth, continuing a trend which emerged previously in 2005.   Our Affinity business continues to make an important contribution to organic revenue growth, and we continue to take steps to strengthen that business.  For each of our operating segments, 2005 marked a year of good progress toward realizing the full potential of our tremendous portfolio of businesses."
 
Restructuring Plan
 
The previously announced three-year restructuring plan is currently expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of $262 million, including employee termination and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, and other costs associated with the restructuring.  Annualized cost savings are now targeted at approximately $180 million by 2008.  Certain aspects of the plan are not finalized, and actual total costs, the timing of the costs, and ultimate savings may vary from the estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying this plan.   An analysis of restructuring related expenses by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2005 is presented in the attached reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
Below is a summary of third and fourth quarter 2005 restructuring costs and an estimate of restructuring and related expenses through the end of 2007 by type and by geographic region.
 
 
 
Fourth Quarter and Twelve Months Segment Review
 
fourth quarter revenue of $1.4 billion was essentially unchanged from the prior year, with 3% organic revenue growth.  Contingent commission revenue reflecting amounts relating to arrangements in existence prior to October 1, 2004 was $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and $11 million in fourth quarter 2004.   Contingent commission revenue was $26 million and $111 million for the twelve months of 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services
 
Organic revenue in Brokerage-Americas rose 10%, primarily driven by the impact of new business in all geographic regions as well as in the Affinity business.  Brokerage-International organic revenue declined 3%, with strong new business generation in Continental Europe offset by weaker revenue performance in the U.K.   A 1% decline in Reinsurance organic growth reflected the impact of higher risk retention by clients and weaker pricing in the international markets, partially offset by new business in the Americas.
Fourth quarter pretax income increased to $134 million from $12 million in 2004, and the pretax margin improved to 9.3% from 0.8% a year ago.   Excluding unusual items as detailed in the attached reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, the pretax margin improved to 17.4% in 2005 from 12.8% in 2004, driven by a 5% decline in expenses.
 
Twelve months pretax income increased 25% to $719 million and the pretax margin improved 280 basis points to 13.3% from 10.5%.  Excluding certain unusual items, the brokerage pretax margin was 16.0% for 2005 and 13.6% for 2004.
 
revenue of $336 million declined 1% during the quarter on both a reported and an organic basis.   Lost business and lower levels of new business in the U.S. contributed to a 4% decline in Outsourcing organic revenue.  Contingent commission revenue was $2 million and $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004, and $6 million and $21 million for the twelve months of 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Consulting
 
Fourth quarter pretax income increased 82% to $40 million, and the pretax margin was 11.9% for 2005 and 6.5% for 2004.  A principal contributor to the year over year improvement was the impact of the provision for legal settlements in the fourth quarter of 2004.   Twelve months pretax income increased 5% to $110 million and the pretax margin was 8.8% in 2005 compared to 8.4% in 2004.
 
revenue was $756 million in the quarter, with segment organic revenue growth, which is based on written premiums and fees, of 9%.   In the Accident & Health and Life business, organic revenue grew 10%, primarily driven by strong growth in the sales of a supplemental health product.   Warranty, Credit and Property & Casualty organic revenue growth was 8% in the quarter.
Insurance
Underwriting
 
Fourth quarter pretax income rose 30% to $79 million reflecting strong growth in sales of a supplemental health product, improved profitability in the specialty property and casualty business, and higher investment income.  The pretax margin improved to 10.4% in 2005 from 7.8% in 2004.   Twelve months pretax income increased 24% to $314 million and the pretax margin improved to 9.8% from 8.1% in 2004.
 
segment revenue was $21 million in the quarter compared to $61 million in 2004.  Fourth quarter 2004 results included a $37 million pretax gain on the sale of Endurance common stock.
Corporate and Other
 
segment was $47 million compared with a loss of $2 million a year ago, principally driven by the gain on sale of Endurance common stock in 2004 and higher general expenses including restructuring costs in 2005.
The pretax loss in the Corporate and Other
 
The pretax loss for twelve months was $178 million compared to a pretax loss of $108 million a year ago, primarily reflecting the 2004 gain on sale of Endurance common stock, the impact of the Company's investment in Endurance common stock and warrants, and higher general expenses including 2005 restructuring costs.
Discontinued Operations
 
Fourth quarter after tax income from discontinued operations was $80 million ($0.23 per share) in 2005, primarily reflecting the gain on sale of Aon's U.S.-based wholesale broking operation, Swett & Crawford.
 
Effective Tax Rate and Earnings Repatriation
 
The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 30.1% for the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to 21.5% for the fourth quarter of 2004.   The full year tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were 33.5% and 34.1%, respectively.  The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2005 reflects the favorable resolution of tax issues and lower effective state tax rates, partially offset by the impact of restructuring charges.  In 2004, a one-time tax benefit resulting from the difference between Aon's tax and book basis in Cambridge (U.S. claims services business sold in 2004) reduced the effective tax rate.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2005, Aon repatriated $101 million of foreign earnings pursuant to the special tax incentives of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  The Company incurred $5 million ($0.01 per share) of tax expense in connection with the repatriated earnings.
 
Foreign Exchange Impact
 
Fourth quarter 2005 earnings per share were not affected by foreign currency translation.  Fourth quarter 2005 and 2004 earnings per share included $0.02 and $0.05 of currency hedging gains, respectively.
 
Twelve months 2005 earnings per share were positively affected by $0.05 related to foreign currency translation gains.  In addition, twelve months 2005 and 2004 earnings per share included $0.08 and $0.11 of currency hedging gains, respectively.
 
Financial Condition
 
Total debt and preferred stock decreased $55 million to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004.  Total debt and preferred stock as a percentage of total capital was reduced to 28% from 30% over the same period.  Stockholders' equity was $5.3 billion Compared to September 30, 2005, total debt increased $225 million primarily reflecting an increase in funds borrowed by certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries to offset earnings repatriated during the quarter.
.
 
During 2005, Aon made cash contributions of $463 million to its principal pension plans, including a $200 million contribution to the U.S. pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2005.
 
Approximately 94% of Aon's investment portfolio at quarter end was in short-term and fixed maturities, with 98% of the fixed income securities rated investment grade. 
 
Stock Repurchase Program
 
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Aon completed the repurchase of 675,000 shares of common stock for $24.7 million under the existing $1 billion buyback authorization.

This press release contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. Potential factors that could impact results include: general economic conditions in different countries in which we do business around the world, changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets, fluctuations in exchange and interest rates that could influence revenue and expense, rating agency actions that could affect our ability to borrow funds, funding of our various pension plans, changes in the competitive environment, our ability to implement restructuring initiatives and other initiatives intended to yield cost savings, our ability to execute the stock repurchase program, changes in commercial property and casualty markets and commercial premium rates that could impact revenues, changes in revenues and earnings due to the elimination of contingent commissions, other uncertainties surrounding a new compensation model, the impact of investigations brought by state attorneys general, state insurance regulators, federal prosecutors, and federal regulators, the impact of class actions and individual lawsuits including client class actions, securities class actions, derivative actions, and ERISA class actions, the cost of resolution of other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies, and the difference in ultimate paid claims in our underwriting companies from actuarial estimates.  Further information concerning the Company and its business, including factors that potentially could materially affect the Company's financial results, is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
This press release includes supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, a measure that management believes is important to evaluate changes in revenue from existing operations.  We believe that this supplemental information is helpful to investors.  Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, unusual items, and for the underwriting segment only, an adjustment between written and earned premium.  A reconciliation is provided in the attached schedules.  The supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts.  It should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Summary of Operations.  Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.
 
This press release also includes supplemental information related to several measures - income per share, expenses, and margins - that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other noteworthy items that impacted revenue and pretax income in the comparable periods.  Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors.  The measures that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other items do not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts.  They should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Summary of Operations.  Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance.
