Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 8, 2006, Aon Holdings b.v., a subsidiary of Aon Corporation (the "Company"), entered into a letter agreement (the "Agreement") with Dirk P.M. Verbeek, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aon Risk Services International.  The Agreement sets forth the terms of Mr. Verbeek's supplemental pension benefit based upon his decision to delay early retirement.
 
The Agreement provides that Mr. Verbeek may be eligible for a supplemental pension benefit from Aon Holdings b.v. if he elects to retire on or after attainment of age 56 but prior to age 62.  The annual amount of the supplemental pension benefit would be that portion of Mr Verbeek's salary currently paid for services performed in the Netherlands (the "Base Salary," which is currently  463,867/U.S. $553,576 as of the date of this Report).  The Agreement further provides that Mr. Verbeek's spouse will be entitled to receive this supplemental pension benefit in the event Mr. Verbeek dies prior to attaining age 62.  In addition, Mr. Verbeek may be eligible to receive a supplemental pension benefit of 30% of the Base Salary from Aon Holdings b.v. if he elects to retire on or after the attainment of age 62 but prior to age 65.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
