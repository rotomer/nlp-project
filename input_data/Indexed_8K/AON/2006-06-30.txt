In the event the Indemnified Party shall refuse to consent to the settlement of any third Person claim, so long as only money damages that are payable in full by the Indemnitor are involved and there is no admission of liability, wrongdoing or violation of law or the rights of any Person with respect to the Indemnified Party, the liability of the Indemnitor in respect of such third Person claim shall not exceed the amount for which the third Person claim could have been settled plus the amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the time of the proposed settlement to which it is entitled to indemnification.
