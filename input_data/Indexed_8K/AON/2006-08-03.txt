Exhibit 99.1
Aon Reports Second Quarter Results;
Provides Update on Sale of Aon Warranty Group
- - Aon Corporation (NYSE: AOC) today reported second quarter and six months 2006 results.
CHICAGO, IL  August 3, 2006
Second quarter 2006 net income was $193 million or $0.57 per share, compared to $191 million or $0.57 per share in 2005; excluding restructuring charges under the company's previously announced program, net income per share was $0.61 in second quarter 2006.  Six months 2006 net income was $391 million or $1.13 per share, compared to $391 million or $1.16 per share in 2005.
For the quarter, net income from continuing operations was $181 million or $0.53 per share, compared to $193 million or $0.58 per share a year ago.  Six months 2006 net income from continuing operations was $362 million or $1.05 per share, compared to $381 million or $1.13 per share a year ago.  Second quarter and six months 2005 results from continuing operations benefited by $0.10 per share from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, resulting in unusually low effective tax rates.
Certain items influenced the second quarter and six month comparisons against the prior year and are detailed in the reconciliation of the impact of non-GAAP measures on pages 10 and 11.  On that basis, second quarter and six months 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 29%and 20%, respectively, compared to a year ago.
Greg Case, Aon's president and CEO, said, "This was a solid quarter for Aon.  We achieved good organic revenue growth in Americas Brokerage and Reinsurance, while maintaining expense discipline across the company.  The result is improvement in Aon's underlying earnings, margin, and organic growth rate compared to last year.  We are making investments in our Consulting business which hold great promise, but which are affecting current performance.  In the Insurance Underwriting segment, strong sales of a supplemental health product contributed to significant profit growth and margin improvement.  With the pending disposition of Aon Warranty Group, we intend to focus future insurance underwriting activities solely on the business of Combined Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries."
Sale of Aon Warranty Group
As previously announced, during the quarter Aon signed a definitive agreement to sell Aon Warranty Group (AWG) and its worldwide operations, including Virginia Surety Company.   The operating results of this business, including related Corporate & Other segment investment
income, have been reclassified to discontinued operations for the second quarter and six month periods ending June 30, 2006 and 2005 (see "Discontinued Operations").   The sale is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2006.  Aon continues to explore strategic options with respect to its Specialty Property and Casualty businesses, which are not included in the AWG transaction.
Second Quarter Segment Review 
second quarter revenue increased 5% to $1.4 billion, with 2% organic revenue growth.
Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services
Organic revenue in Brokerage-Americas rose 5%, primarily driven by our U.S. Retail business and growth in Affinity and Latin America.   Brokerage-International organic revenue declined 1% reflecting the negative impact of soft market conditions.  Reinsurance organic revenue grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia driven by new business and improved pricing, partially offset by the impact of higher risk retention by clients and weaker pricing in the U.K. and European markets.
Second quarter pretax income increased 6% to $220 million from $208 million in 2005, and the pretax margin improved to 15.8% in 2006 from 15.6% in 2005.  Adjusting for the items detailed on page 11, the 2006 segment pretax margin improved by 240 basis points to 17.1% from 14.7%, principally due to revenue growth and the benefits of operational improvements and cost reduction initiatives.
Six months pretax income increased 5% to $469 million from $448 million, and the pretax margin improved to 16.8% from 16.7% in 2005.  Adjusting for the items detailed on page 11, the pretax margin improved to 17.5% in 2006 from 15.4% in 2005.
segmentrevenue of $309 million in the quarter reflects 1% organic growth driven primarily by Compensation Consulting and the recently established Financial Advisory and Litigation Consulting (FALC) unit.
Consulting
Second quarter pretax income was $23 million, compared to $29 million in 2005. The pretax income decline was principally due to investments made in the FALC and Global Benefits practices, and reduced volumes from certain outsourcing clients.  The pretax margin was 7.4% in 2006 and 9.2% a year ago.    Adjusting for the items detailed on page 11, the pretax margin was 8.4%, compared to 8.9% a year ago.
Six months pretax income was $53 million, compared to $55 million, and the pretax margin was 8.6% in 2006, compared to 8.8% in 2005.  Excluding the items detailed on page 11, the consulting margin improved by 150 basis points over the first six months of 2005.
revenue increased 9% to $556 million in the quarter, with segment organic revenue growth, which is based on written premiums and fees, of 10%.  In the Accident & Health and Life (A&H and Life) business, organic revenue grew 12% primarily driven by strong growth in a supplemental health product.
Insurance
Underwriting

Second quarter pretax income rose 25% to $79 million reflecting improved profitability in A&H and Life and higher investment income.  The pretax margin improved to 14.2% in 2006 from 12.3% in 2005.
Six months pretax income increased 15.0% to $135 million, and the pretax margin improved to 12.2% from 11.5% in 2005.
segment revenue was $18 million in the quarter, compared to $3 million in 2005.   The pretax loss in the Corporate and Othersegment was $46 million, compared with a loss of $54 million a year ago.
Corporate and Other
The pretax loss for six months was $103 million, compared to a pretax loss of $80 million a year ago.  Six months 2006 results included a $17 million pretax loss related to the revaluation of Endurance warrants, compared to a $15 million pretax gain in 2005.
Restructuring Plan
The previously announced three-year restructuring plan is currently expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $300 million, including employee termination and lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, and other costs associated with the restructuring.  The increase from our previous estimate results primarily from newly identified IT cost saving initiatives.   Annualized cost savings are now targeted at approximately $195 million by 2008.  Certain aspects of the plan are not finalized, and actual total costs, the timing of the costs, and ultimate savings may vary from the estimates due to changes in the scope or assumptions underlying this plan.   An analysis of restructuring-related expenses by segment for the second quarter and six months of 2006 is presented in the attached reconciliation of non-GAAP measures
.
Actual and estimated restructuring costs by reporting period, by type, and by geographic region are detailed on page 12.
Discontinued Operations
The second quarter after-tax income from discontinued operations was $12 million ($0.04 per share) in 2006 and a $2 million after-tax loss ($0.01 per share) in 2005, primarily reflecting the reclassification of AWG.  Selected financial information relating to AWG is included on page 13.
The effective tax rates on discontinued operations were unusually high for 2005 reflecting deferred tax adjustments relating to AWG.
Effective Tax Rate 
The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 34.4% for the second quarter of 2006 compared to 21.5% for the second quarter of 2005.   The year-to-date effective tax rates for the six months ending June 30, 2006 and 2005 were 34.7% and 29.4%, respectively.  The effective tax rates for 2005 were unusually low reflecting the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

Foreign Exchange Impact
Second quarter 2006 earnings per share were positively affected by $0.01 related to foreign currency translation gains relative to the second quarter of 2005.  In addition, second quarter 2006 earnings per share included $0.01 of currency hedging losses compared to $0.02 of hedging gains in 2005.
Accounting Change 
As of January 1, 2006, Aon adopted FASB Statement No.123(R) using the modified prospective transition method, as permitted.  Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated.
Stock option-based compensation expense (included in compensation and benefits expense) related to the adoption of Statement No.123(R) was $6 million pretax or $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2006, and $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share for the six months of 2006.
Financial Condition

Total debt and preferred stock as a percentage of total capital increased to 28% from 27% over the same period.  Stockholders' equity was $5.4 billion at June 30, 2006 Compared to December 31, 2005, total debt decreased $9 million.

This press release contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. Potential factors that could impact results include: general economic conditions in different countries in which we do business around the world, changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets, fluctuations in exchange and interest rates that could influence revenue and expense, rating agency actions that could affect our ability to borrow funds, funding

of our various pension plans, changes in the competitive environment, our ability to implement restructuring initiatives and other initiatives intended to yield cost savings, our ability to execute the stock repurchase program, our ability to execute the planned sale of the Aon Warranty Group, changes in commercial property and casualty markets and commercial premium rates that could impact revenues, changes in revenues and earnings due to the elimination of contingent commissions, other uncertainties surrounding a new compensation model, the impact of investigations brought by state attorneys general, state insurance regulators, federal prosecutors, and federal regulators, the impact of class actions and individual lawsuits including client class actions, securities class actions, derivative actions, and ERISA class actions, the cost of resolution of other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies, and the difference in ultimate paid claims in our underwriting companies from actuarial estimates.  Further information concerning the Company and its business, including factors that potentially could materially affect the Company's financial results, is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
This press release includes supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, a measure that management believes is important to evaluate changes in revenue from existing operations.  We believe that this supplemental information is helpful to investors.  Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, unusual items, and for the underwriting segment only, an adjustment between written and earned premium.  A reconciliation is provided in the attached schedules.  The supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts.  It should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Summary of Operations.  Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.
This press release also includes supplemental information related to several measures - income per share, expenses, and margins - that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other noteworthy items that impacted revenue and pretax income in the comparable periods.  Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors.  The measures that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other items do not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts.  They should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Summary of Operations.  Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.
