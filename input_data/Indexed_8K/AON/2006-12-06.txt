On November 30, 2006, Aon Corporation (the "Company") consummated the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests of the Company's subsidiaries that conduct the Aon Warranty Group ("AWG") business to TWG Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a Warrior Acquisition Corp.), an affiliate of Onex Corporation.  The consideration received consisted of $710 million in cash, pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2006, between the Company and TWG Holdings, Inc. (the "Warranty Agreement"). The final purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment based upon the net worth (excluding goodwill) of AWG at the closing compared to a target level of $420,011,470.
The disposition included AWG's worldwide operations consisting of, among other things, the business of underwriting and administering extended warranties on a wide variety of consumer goods, including automobiles, consumer electronics and major home appliances. AWG also provides consumer credit and other specialty insurance products primarily through automobile dealers.
On November 30, 2006, the Company also consummated the sale of its Construction Program Group ("CPG") business, a managing general underwriter whose policies were underwritten by the Company's property and casualty operation, to Old Republic Insurance Company.  The consideration received by the Company consisted of $85 million in cash, and the transaction included the transfer to Old Republic Insurance Company of approximately $330 million of net unearned premium and claims reserves that were on the books of Virginia Surety Company, Inc., which relate to business previously written through CPG.
