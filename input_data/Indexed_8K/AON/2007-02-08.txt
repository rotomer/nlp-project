Net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items, increased 43% to $0.67 per share compared to $0.47 per share for the prior year quarter.
Net income
"Our fourth quarter results continued to deliver operational improvement as the adjusted pretax margin increased 270 basis points to 13.9%, with meaningful increases across all operating segments, even as we make significant investments for the future in new markets, talent and technology," said Greg Case, president and chief executive officer. "Our 2006 performance is fully on track with the first year of our three-year improvement plan, as we made measurable progress on all three of our key operating metrics. Organic revenue growth was 5%, and on an adjusted basis, pretax margin improved in each operating segment and net income per share from continuing operations increased 22%. We concluded the sale of Warranty and certain specialty Property & Casualty businesses generating approximately $800 million of cash proceeds. Our balance sheet is strong and we repurchased more than $1 billion of stock in 2006, highlighting our belief in the underlying strength of Aon and the positive outlook for 2007 and beyond."
FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL SUMMARY
increased 7% to $2.4 billion with organic revenue growth of 5%. Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services revenue increased 7% to $1.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 2%. Consulting revenue increased 8% to $364 million with organic revenue growth of 8%. Insurance Underwriting revenue increased 9% to $527 million with organic revenue growth of 9% in Accident & Health and Life (A&H and Life).
Total
revenue
increased 3% to $2.2 billion due primarily to an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of $82 million and a $34 million increase in benefits to policyholders, partially offset by a $37 million decrease in restructuring expense and an incremental $33 million of estimated restructuring savings.
Total expenses
was $86 million in the fourth quarter compared to $123 million for the prior year. The previously announced three-year restructuring plan is now anticipated to result in cumulative pretax charges of $365 million. Annualized cost savings are now targeted at approximately $280 million reflecting further refinement of offshoring and outsourcing initiatives. An analysis of restructuring related expenses by segment for the fourth quarter and full year 2006 and 2005 is presented in the attached reconciliation of non-GAAP measures Actual and estimated restructuring costs by reporting period, by type, and by geographic region are detailed on page 16.
Restructuring expense
.
Restructuring benefits realized in the fourth quarter and full year 2006 are estimated at $37 million and $119 million, respectively, of which $28 million and $97 million were related to the brokerage segment, primarily for workforce reduction.
translation losses negatively impacted net income by $0.02 per share compared to the prior year quarter. In addition, fourth quarter net income included $0.01 per share of currency hedging losses compared to $0.02 per share of hedging gains in the prior year quarter.
Foreign currency
on continuing operations was 24.4% for the fourth quarter compared to 28.2% for the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 and for 2005 was impacted by a number of items including adjustments, resolution of certain items and tax credits.

Diluted average shares outstanding
after-tax income in the fourth quarter was $35 million or $0.10 per share compared to $122 million or $0.35 per share in the prior year quarter. After-tax income reflects both the results of operations and the dispositions of Aon Warranty Group (AWG) and Construction Program Group (CPG) during the fourth quarter of 2006. Income from discontinued operations in the prior year quarter primarily reflects the gain on sale of Swett & Crawford of $108 million after-tax or $0.31 per share.

OTHER DISCLOSURE
The Company recently determined that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock options granted in 2000 and in certain years prior appear to have been used for financial accounting purposes. Based upon our preliminary review, the Company has not found evidence of intentional misconduct or financial self-dealing, including backdating or other manipulation of stock option pricing. The Audit Committee has commenced a comprehensive review of option grant date practices and related accounting issues. We are as yet unable to determine the amount of additional non-cash stock based compensation expense, if any, or the related tax impact; however, it is not expected that the effect, if any, will be material in 2005 or 2006. We will

attempt to quantify the impact on financial reporting for prior periods by the time the Company files its Form 10-K on or before March 1, 2007.

This press release includes supplemental information related to organic revenue growth, a measure that management believes is important to evaluate changes in revenue from existing operations. We believe that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Organic revenue growth excludes from reported revenues the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, investment income, reimbursable expenses, unusual items, and for the underwriting segment only, an adjustment between written and earned premium. A reconciliation is provided in the attached schedules. The supplemental organic revenue growth information does not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts. It should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Summary of Operations. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.
This press release also includes supplemental information related to several measures - income per share, expenses, and margins - that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other noteworthy items that impacted revenue and pretax income in the comparable
7
periods. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. The measures that exclude the effects of the restructuring charges and certain other items do not affect net income or any other GAAP reported amounts. They should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's Consolidated Summary of Operations. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information regarding their performance, although they may not make identical adjustments.
