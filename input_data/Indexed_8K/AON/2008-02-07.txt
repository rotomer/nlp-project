Net income from continuing operations increased 33% to $190 million or $0.59 per share, compared to $143 million or $0.43 per share for the prior year quarter.

djusted pretax margin increased 110 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17 percent
," said Greg Case, president and chief executive officer, Aon Corporation.
 
"Our fourth quarter and 2007 results are fully on schedule with the second year of our three-year improvement plan.  Our expense initiatives and restructuring programs are delivering meaningful margin improvement while funding investments in value-added services and capabilities for our clients.  We increased our focus on core assets with the announced sale of our lower-margin, more capital-intensive insurance underwriting businesses.  Our balance sheet is strong, which provides financial flexibility, and we increased our authorized share repurchase program by $2.6 billion.  All these actions support our belief in the underlying strength of Aon and our ongoing commitment to long-term shareholder value creation."

Pension expense
related to the Company's major defined benefit pension plans declined to $15 million in the fourth quarter compared to $54 million in the prior year quarter.  Pension expense declined to $80 million in 2007 compared to $233 million in 2006 due primarily to plan amendments made in the Company's major defined benefit pension plans.  The Company currently anticipates that 2008 pension expense will be similar to 2007.
 
Restructuring expense
was $34 million in the fourth quarter compared to $78 million in the prior year quarter. 
An analysis of restructuring related expenses by segment and type for the 2005 and 2007 restructuring programs is detailed on page 13 of this release.
 
Restructuring savings realized in the fourth quarter are estimated at $64 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter.  Of the estimated restructuring savings in the fourth quarter, $54 million were related to the Brokerage segment, primarily for workforce reduction.  The 2005 restructuring program resulted in cumulative cost savings of approximately $225 million in 2007 and is on track to achieve $270 million of cumulative cost savings in 2008.  Cumulative cost savings estimates do not include any benefits related to businesses placed into discontinued operations.
 
The 2007 restructuring program, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to result in cumulative cost savings of approximately $50-70 million in 2008, $175-200 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2010, consistent with previous estimates.
 
Foreign currency
translation increased net income by $0.04 per share compared to the prior year quarter.
 
Effective tax rate
on continuing operations was 30.4% for the fourth quarter compared to 26.7% for the prior year quarter.  Both quarters were impacted by the resolution of certain items, non-recurring tax adjustments and tax credits.  The Company currently anticipates that the effective tax rate on continuing operations will be 33.0% for 2008.
 
Diluted average shares outstanding
declined to 324 million in the fourth quarter compared to 334 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the Company's share repurchase program.  During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased 544,700 shares of common stock for $26 million, at an average price of $47.29 per share.
 
Discontinued Operations
after-tax income was $17 million or $0.05 per share compared to $80 million or $0.24 per share for the prior year quarter.  Discontinued operations include the results of Combined Insurance Company of America (CICA) and Sterling Life Insurance (Sterling), as well as the results and dispositions of Aon Warranty Group (AWG) and Construction Program Group (CPG), which were sold in the fourth quarter 2006.  CICA's fourth quarter 2007 results include a $28 million non-recurring tax adjustment related to the recognition of deferred taxes of foreign subsidiaries.
