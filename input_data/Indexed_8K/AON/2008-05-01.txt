Total operating expenses
 
Restructuring expense
was $60 million in the first quarter compared to $9 million in the prior year quarter. 
An analysis of restructuring-related expenses by segment and type for the 2007 restructuring program is detailed on page 11 of this release.
 
Restructuring savings in the first quarter related to the 2005 restructuring program are estimated at $67 million compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter.  Of the estimated restructuring savings in the first quarter, $57 million were related to the Brokerage segment, primarily for workforce reduction.  The 2005 restructuring program resulted in cumulative cost savings of approximately $225 million in 2007 and is on track to achieve $270 million of cumulative cost savings in 2008.
 
The Company did not recognize any material savings related to the 2007 restructuring program.  Before any potential reinvestment of savings, the 2007 restructuring program is expected to result in cumulative cost savings of approximately $50-70 million in 2008, $175-200 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2010, consistent with previous estimates.
 
Foreign currency
translation increased net income by approximately $0.08 per share compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a weaker U.S. dollar versus the Euro.
 
Effective tax rate
on continuing operations was 30.1% for the first quarter compared to 31.3% for the prior year quarter.  The rate in both quarters was impacted favorably by the resolution of prior year tax issues.  As a result of projected 2008 geographic distribution of income and the benefit of significant statutory rate reductions in key operating jurisdictions, the Company currently anticipates that the recurring tax rate on continuing operations will be approximately 30.5% for 2008.
 
Diluted average shares outstanding
declined to 320 million in the first quarter compared to 324 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to the Company's share repurchase program.  During the first quarter, the Company repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $375 million, at an average price of $42.19 per share.  Subsequent to close of the quarter, the Company repurchased an additional 10.9 million shares, or $485 million, at an average price of $44.46 per share.  As of May 1, the Company had approximately $1.9 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization.
 
Discontinued Operations
after-tax income was $39 million or $0.12 per share compared to $48 million or $0.15 per share for the prior year quarter.  Discontinued operations include the results of CICA and Sterling Life Insurance.

Asia Pacific organic revenue increased 3% reflecting solid growth in most Asian markets, partially offset by soft market conditions in Australia and the impact of certain regulatory changes in Japan.  Reinsurance organic revenue increased 1% due primarily to growth in global facultative and treaty placements, partially offset by soft market conditions and higher cedent retentions.
 
 
Compensation and benefits for the first quarter increased 13% or $111 million from the prior year quarter including a $49 million increase in restructuring costs, $48 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and investments in key talent, partially offset by benefits related to the 2005 restructuring program.
