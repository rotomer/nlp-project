As Benfield is incorporated and has its registered office in Bermuda, the Code does not apply to the Acquisition. However, pursuant to the terms of the Implementation Agreement, Benfield and Bidco have agreed that the provisions of the Code will apply to the Acquisition. Benfield agrees to comply with the Code in relation to the Acquisition for so long as the Board determines that to do so it is in the best interests of Benfield. Aon has undertaken to comply with the Code for so long as (i) the Benfield Board recommend the Acquisition; (ii) the Benfield Board do not withdraw or adversely modify the recommendation of the Acquisition; (iii) the Benfield Board do not resolve to cease complying with the Code; and (iv) any other potential offeror also agrees to comply with the Code within a certain period following its offer or approach to Benfield. Benfield and Aon have acknowledged that the Takeover Panel does not have jurisdiction over the Acquisition and have agreed to appoint an independent committee with
delegated authority from the Benfield Board to determine the application and interpretation of the Code. In the event of any dispute arising between affected parties which cannot be resolved, Benfield and Aon have agreed to jointly refer the dispute to an independent third party who has, in the opinion of Benfield and Aon acting reasonably, suitable experience and expertise in respect of the Code to determine that dispute.
