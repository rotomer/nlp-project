Item 1.01               Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 30, 2009, in connection with recent developments in Delaware case law, the Board of Directors of Aon Corporation ("Aon") approved the form of an indemnification agreement between Aon and each of the directors and officers of Aon.  The purpose of the indemnification agreement is to provide specific contractual assurance with respect to the existing indemnification and expense advancement rights extended to such officers and directors under Article Seventh of Aon's amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation.  The indemnification agreement provides assurance that no future amendment to or revocation of the Certificate of Incorporation will adversely affect any existing right of an officer or director with respect to any event that occurred prior to such amendment or revocation (regardless of when any proceeding related to such event is first threatened, commenced or completed).
 
A copy of the form of indemnification agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 5.02(e)          Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On January 30, 2009, in connection with the decision to freeze the Aon Pension Plan (as described in Item 8.01 below), the Board of Directors of Aon approved and adopted an amendment to the Aon Excess Benefit Plan.  This amendment is designed to reduce future pension costs and provides that, effective April 1, 2009, all future benefit accruals under the Aon Excess Benefit Plan will automatically cease for all participants, and the accrued benefits under the Aon Excess Benefit Plan will be determined and frozen as of that date.
 
These changes to the Aon Excess Benefit Plan will not affect benefits earned by participants prior to April 1, 2009.
 
The amendment to the Aon Excess Benefit Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Board of Directors of Aon also approved modifications to the Aon Supplemental Savings Plan, effective January 1, 2009 to implement a supplemental savings plan account for employees earning more than the IRS compensation limit for 401(k) plans ($245,000 in 2009) who contribute the maximum allowable amount to their 401(k) plans.  Aon will make contributions to this account at rates calculated as a percentage of eligible pay that will escalate based upon years of service to Aon, beginning at three percent (3%) for employees with one to four years of service; four percent (4%) for employees with five to nine years of service; five percent (5%) for employees with ten to fourteen years of service; and six percent (6%) for employees with fifteen or more years of service.
 
In addition to the actions described in this Item 5.02(e), the Board of Directors also authorized certain modifications to the Aon Pension Plan and the Aon Savings Plan, which are described in Item 8.01 below.
 
Item 5.03               Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On January 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Aon approved amendments to, and restated, Aon's bylaws.  The bylaws were amended and restated primarily to:  (i) modify the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and the proposal of other business, as applicable, at an annual or special meeting of stockholders to expand the information required to be provided by the stockholder making such nomination or proposal; revise the time periods during which such notice must be given; ensure that such provisions are clear and unambiguous; and clarify that compliance with the notice procedures is the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business at a meeting of stockholders (other than proposals governed by Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended); (ii) modify the voting standard to be applied in the event of a contested election of directors from majority voting to plurality voting; (iii) reflect that the role of Chairman of the Board of Aon
 
may, or may not be, held by an employee or officer of Aon, and provide for the role of lead independent director in the event of the selection of an executive Chairman; (iv) modify the notice period necessary to call a special meeting of the Board of Directors; (v) confirm that shares of Aon's common stock may be certificated or uncertificated; and (vi) clarify the discretion of the Board in setting the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
 
The amended and restated bylaws also contain certain other clarifying and conforming changes.  The amended bylaws became effective on January 30, 2009.
 
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to Aon's amended and restated bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 Item 8.01.             Other Events.
 
Concurrently with the actions described in Item 5.02(e) above,
on January 30, 2009, the Board of Directors of Aon approved and adopted an amendment to the Aon Pension Plan.  This amendment is designed to reduce future pension costs and provides that, effective April 1, 2009, all future benefit accruals under the Aon Pension Plan will automatically cease for all participants, and the accrued benefits under the Aon Pension Plan will be determined and frozen as of that date.
 
These changes to the Aon Pension Plan will not affect benefits earned by participants prior to April 1, 2009.
 
The amendment to the Aon Pension Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Limitation of Liability of Directors and Indemnification
.
 
 
A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit.  If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended after approval by the stockholders of this article to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation law, as so amended.
 
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph by the stockholders of the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
 
 
(a)  .   Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a part to or is otherwise involved (including involvement as a witness) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation or, while a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators; , , that, except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in connection with any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter
Right to Indemnification
provided
however
an "advancement of expenses"); , , that, if and to the extent that the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section or otherwise.
provided
however
 
(b)  .  If a claim for indemnification (including the advancement of expenses) under paragraph (a) is not paid in full by the corporation within forty-five days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.  If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.  In any suit by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the indemnitee has not met with applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit.  In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder or by the corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this paragraph (b) or otherwise shall be on the corporation.
Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit
 
(c)  .   Any person serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests are owned by the corporation (hereinafter a "subsidiary"), shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at the request of the corporation.
Service for Subsidiaries
 
(d)  .   Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision become or remain directors or officers of the corporation or who, while a director or officer of the corporation, become or remain a director, officer, employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have relied on the rights to indemnity and advancement of expenses
Reliance
contained in this Article Seventh in entering into or continuing such service.  The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this Section shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the adoption hereof.
 
(e)  .   The rights to indemnification and to advancement of expenses conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this certificate of incorporation or under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Non-Exclusivity of Rights
 
(f)   .  The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Insurance
 
(g)  .  The corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors of the corporation, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses, to any employee or agent of the corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of the Section with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the  corporation.
