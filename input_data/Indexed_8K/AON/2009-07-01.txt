Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On July 1, 2009, Aon Financial Services Luxembourg, S.A. (the "Issuer"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon Corporation ("Aon"), closed the offering of 500 million of its 6.25% Guaranteed Notes due July 1, 2014 (the "Notes").  The Notes were issued pursuant to a Trust Deed, dated July 1, 2009 (the "Trust Deed"), between the Issuer, Aon and BNY Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee").  Aon has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the payment of the principal and interest in respect of the Notes and all other sums from time to time payable by the Issuer pursuant to the Trust Deed.
 
The Notes will bear interest at the rate of 6.25% per annum, payable annually in arrear on July 1, commencing on July 1, 2010, and the Notes have been accepted by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the "Exchange") for the purpose of listing the Notes on the official list of the Exchange and trading the Notes on the Exchange's Euro MTF Market.
 
The Notes are direct, unconditional and (subject to the terms of the Notes) unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank , without any preference among themselves, with all other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, present and future, but, in the event of insolvency, only to the extent permitted by applicable laws relating to creditors' rights.
pari passu
 
The terms and conditions of the Notes are contained in Schedule 2 to the Trust Deed, and include a negative pledge provision limiting certain indebtedness that would be secured by any present or future common stock of the Issuer or Aon's significant subsidiaries, unless all amounts payable by Aon under the Notes, the interest coupons of the Notes and the Trust Deed are secured equally and ratably with such indebtedness.  In addition, the Issuer may, at its sole option, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes at any time at par plus accrued interest, in the event of certain tax changes set forth in the Trust Deed.  In the event of a change of control of Aon and the Notes experiencing a rating downgrade event as defined in the terms of the Notes, the Note holders have the option to require the Issuer to redeem or, at the Issuer's option, purchase any of the Notes at their principal amount together with interest accrued.  If holders of over 75% of the principal amount of Notes exercise this option, then the Issuer may choose to redeem or purchase all of the remaining Notes remaining outstanding at principal plus accrued interest.
 
Aon intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes for its general corporate purposes, including using a portion of the proceeds to repay all of its current outstanding borrowings under its 650 million multi-currency revolving loan credit facility, which as of June 29, 2009 are approximately 482 million and have a floating daily interest rate that was approximately 1% as of the close of business on June 29, 2009.
 
In general, if an event of default occurs, the Notes may be declared immediately due and payable by the Trustee at their principal amount together with accrued interest as set forth in the Trust Deed.  Such events of default include the failure to pay interest due in respect of the Notes for 30 days, failure by the Issuer or Aon to perform its other obligations under the conditions of the Notes or the Trust Deed (following a 90-day cure period for curable matters), which is certified by the Trustee as being materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders, certain cases of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings, the Issuer ceasing to be a subsidiary of Aon, and the failure of the Aon guarantee to remain in full force and effect.
The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Notes have been offered for sale exclusively outside the United States to non-U.S. investors in the non-U.S. capital markets in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act, and may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. This Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the Notes, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

GUARANTEE
 
7.1
                                
The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, and notwithstanding the release of any other guarantor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditors of the Issuer or any other Subsidiary of the Guarantor, guarantees to the Trustee:
 
(a)
                                 
the due and punctual payment in accordance with the provisions of these presents of the principal of and interest on the Notes and of any other amounts payable by the Issuer under these presents; and
 
(b)
                                
the due and punctual performance and observance by the Issuer of each of the other provisions of these presents on the Issuer's part to be performed or observed.
 
7.2
                                
If the Issuer fails for any reason whatsoever punctually to pay any such principal, interest or other amount, the Guarantor shall cause each and every such payment to be made as if the Guarantor instead of the Issuer were expressed to be the primary obligor under these presents and not merely as surety (but without affecting the nature of the Issuer's obligations) with the intent that the holder of the relevant Note or Coupon or the Trustee (as the case may be) shall receive the same amounts in respect of principal, interest or such other amount as would have been receivable had such payments been made by the Issuer.
 
7.3
                                
If any payment received by the Trustee or any Noteholder or Couponholder under the provisions of these presents shall (whether on the subsequent bankruptcy, insolvency or corporate reorganisation of the Issuer or, without limitation, on any other event) be avoided or set aside for any reason, such payment shall not be considered as discharging or diminishing the liability of the Guarantor and this guarantee shall continue to apply as if such payment had at all times remained owing by the Issuer and the Guarantor shall indemnify the Trustee and the Noteholders and/or Couponholders (as the case may be) in respect thereof PROVIDED THAT the obligations of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor under this subclause shall, as regards each payment made to the Trustee or any Noteholder or Couponholder which is avoided or set aside, be contingent upon such payment being reimbursed to the Issuer or other persons entitled through the Issuer.
 
7.4
                                
The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations under this clause shall be unconditional and that the Guarantor shall be fully liable irrespective of the validity, regularity, legality or enforceability against the Issuer of, or of any defence or counter-claim whatsoever available to the Issuer in relation to, its obligations under these presents, whether or not any action has been taken to enforce the same or any judgment obtained against the Issuer, whether or not any of the other provisions of these presents have been modified, whether or not any time, indulgence, waiver, authorisation or consent has been granted to the Issuer by or on behalf of the Noteholders or the Couponholders or the Trustee, whether or not any determination has been made by the Trustee pursuant to subclause 19.1, whether or not there have been any dealings or transactions between the Issuer, any of the Noteholders or Couponholders or the Trustee, whether or not the Issuer has been dissolved, liquidated, merged, consolidated, bankrupted or has changed its status, functions, control or ownership, whether or not the Issuer has been prevented from making payment by foreign exchange provisions applicable at its place of registration or incorporation and whether or not any other circumstances have occurred which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of or defence to a guarantor.  Accordingly the validity of this guarantee shall not be affected by reason of any invalidity, irregularity, illegality or unenforceability of all or any of the obligations of the Issuer under these presents and this guarantee shall not be discharged nor shall the liability of the Guarantor under these presents be affected by any act, thing or omission or means
whatever whereby its liability would not have been discharged if it had been the principal debtor.
 
7.5
                                
Without prejudice to the provisions of subclause 9.1 the Trustee may determine from time to time whether or not it will enforce this guarantee which it may do without making any demand of or taking any proceedings against the Issuer and may from time to time make any arrangement or compromise with the Guarantor in relation to this guarantee which the Trustee may consider expedient in the interests of the Noteholders.
 
7.6
                                
The Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of dissolution, liquidation, merger or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, protest or notice with respect to these presents or the indebtedness evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever and covenants that this guarantee shall be a continuing guarantee, shall extend to the ultimate balance of all sums payable and obligations owed by the Issuer under these presents, shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations in these presents and is additional to, and not instead of, any security or other guarantee or indemnity at any time existing in favour of any person, whether from the Guarantor or otherwise.
 
7.7
                                
If any moneys shall become payable by the Guarantor under this guarantee the Guarantor shall not, so long as the same remain unpaid, without the prior written consent of the Trustee:
 
(a)
                                 
in respect of any amounts paid by it under this guarantee, exercise any rights of subrogation or contribution or, without limitation, any other right or remedy which may accrue to it in respect of or as a result of any such payment; or
 
(b)
                                
in respect of any other moneys for the time being due to the Guarantor by the Issuer, claim payment thereof or exercise any other right or remedy;
 
(including in either case claiming the benefit of any security or right of set-off or, on the liquidation of the Issuer, proving in competition with the Trustee).  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or administration of the Issuer, any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by the Guarantor before payment in full of all amounts payable under these presents shall have been made to the Noteholders, the Couponholders and the Trustee, such payment or distribution shall be received by the Guarantor on trust to pay the same over immediately to the Trustee for application in or towards the payment of all sums due and unpaid under these presents in accordance with clause 10.
 
7.8
                                
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Issuer under these presents have been irrevocably paid in full, the Trustee may:
 
(a)
                                 
refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by the Trustee in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise), and the Guarantor shall not be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
 
(b)
                                
hold in a suspense account any moneys received from the Guarantor or on account of the Guarantor's liability under this guarantee, without liability to pay interest on those moneys.
 
7.9
                                
The obligations of the Guarantor under these presents constitute direct, unconditional and (subject to the provisions of Condition 4 ()) unsecured obligations of the
Negative Pledge
Guarantor and (subject as aforesaid) rank and will rank with all other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantor, present and future, but, in the event of insolvency, only to the extent permitted by applicable laws relating to creditors' rights.

INVESTMENT BY TRUSTEE
 
12.1
                          
If the amount of the moneys at any time available for the payment of principal and interest in respect of the Notes under Clause 10 is less than 10 per cent. of the nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding, the Trustee may at its discretion and pending payment invest such moneys in some or one of the investments hereinafter authorised for such periods as it may consider expedient with power from time to time at the like discretion to vary such investments and to accumulate such investments and the resulting interest and other income derived therefrom. The accumulated investments shall be applied under clause 10. All interest and other income deriving from such investments shall be applied first in payment or satisfaction of all amounts then due and unpaid under clause 15 to the Trustee and/or any Appointee and otherwise held for the benefit of and paid to the Noteholders or the holders of the related Coupons, as the case may be.

If that bank or institution is the Trustee or a subsidiary, holding or associated company of the Trustee, it need only account for an amount of interest equal to the amount of interest which would, at then current rates, be payable by it on such a deposit to an independent customer. The Trustee may at any time vary any such investments for or into other investments or convert any moneys so deposited into any other currency and shall not be responsible for any loss resulting from any such investments or deposits, whether due to depreciation in value, fluctuations in exchange rates or otherwise.

any Liability incurred by any of them arising from the non-payment by the Issuer or the Guarantor of any amount due to the Trustee or the Noteholders or Couponholders under these presents by reason of any variation in the rates of exchange between those used for the purposes of calculating the amount due under a judgment or order in respect thereof and those prevailing at the date of actual payment by the Issuer or the Guarantor; and

any deficiency arising or resulting from any variation in rates of exchange between (i) the date as of which the local currency equivalent of the amounts due or contingently due under these presents (other than this clause) is calculated for the purposes of any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation of the Issuer or the Guarantor and (ii) the final date for ascertaining the amount of claims in such bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation.

any distribution of assets in connection with any such bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subclause 23.1 above, the Trustee may, upon giving prior notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor (but without the consent of the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Noteholders or the Couponholders), appoint any person established or resident in any jurisdiction (whether a Trust Corporation or not) to act either as a separate trustee or as a co-trustee jointly with the Trustee:

(b)
                                
for the purposes of conforming to any legal requirements, restrictions or conditions in any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts is or are to be performed; or
 
(c)

Such a person shall (subject always to the provisions of these presents) have such trusts, powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding those conferred on the Trustee by these presents) and such duties and obligations as shall be conferred or imposed by the instrument of appointment.  The Trustee shall have power in like manner to remove any such person.

TRUSTEE'S RETIREMENT AND REMOVAL
 
A trustee of these presents may retire at any time on giving not less than 60 days' prior written notice to the Issuer and the Guarantor without giving any reason and without being responsible for any Liabilities incurred by reason of such retirement.  The Noteholders may by Extraordinary Resolution remove any trustee or trustees for the time being of these presents.  The Issuer and the Guarantor undertake that in the event of the only trustee of these presents which is a Trust Corporation (for the avoidance of doubt, disregarding for this purpose any separate or co-trustee appointed under subclause 23.2) giving notice under this clause or being removed by Extraordinary Resolution they will use their best endeavours to procure that a new trustee of these presents being a Trust Corporation is appointed as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.  The retirement or removal of any such trustee shall not become effective until a successor trustee being a Trust Corporation is appointed.  If, in such circumstances, no appointment of such a new trustee has become effective within 60 days of the date of such notice or Extraordinary Resolution, the Trustee shall be entitled to appoint a Trust Corporation as trustee of these presents, but no such appointment shall take effect unless previously approved by an Extraordinary Resolution.

Every question submitted to a meeting shall be decided in the first instance by a show of hands.  A poll may be demanded (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) by the Chairman, the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or any Eligible Person (whatever the amount of the Notes so held or represented by him).
 
13.
                                
At any meeting, unless a poll is duly demanded, a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried by a particular majority or lost or not carried by a particular majority shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.
 
14.
                                
Subject to paragraph 15, if at any such meeting a poll is so demanded it shall be taken in such manner and, subject as hereinafter provided, either at once or after an adjournment as the Chairman directs and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded as at the date of the taking of the poll.  The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of the meeting for the transaction of any business other than the motion on which the poll has been demanded.
 
15.
                                
The Chairman may, with the consent of (and shall if directed by) any such meeting, adjourn the same from time to time and from place to place; but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.
 
16.

Save as aforesaid, no person shall be entitled to attend and speak nor shall any person be entitled to vote at any meeting
unless he is an Eligible Person.  No person shall be entitled to vote at any meeting in respect of Notes which are deemed to be not outstanding by virtue of the proviso to the definition of "outstanding" in clause 1.
 
18.
                                
At any meeting:
 
(a)
                                 
on a show of hands every Eligible Person present shall have one vote; and
 
(b)
                                
on a poll every Eligible Person present shall have one vote in respect of each 1 or such other amount as the Trustee may in its absolute discretion stipulate, in principal amount of the Notes held or represented by such Eligible Person.

19.

Minutes of all resolutions and proceedings at every meeting shall be made and entered in books to be from time to time provided for that purpose by the Issuer and any such minutes as aforesaid, if purporting to be signed by the Chairman of the meeting at which such resolutions were passed or proceedings transacted, shall be conclusive evidence of the matters therein contained and, until the contrary is proved, every such meeting in respect of the proceedings of which minutes have been made shall be deemed to have been duly held and convened and all resolutions passed or proceedings transacted thereat to have been duly passed or transacted.
