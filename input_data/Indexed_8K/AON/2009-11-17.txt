(e)
 
On November 13, 2009, Aon Corporation (the "Company") entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Gregory C. Case, its President and Chief Executive Officer, which modifies the existing employment agreement dated as of April 4, 2005 between the Company and Mr. Case (the "Prior Agreement").  The terms of the Prior Agreement were disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on April 5, 2005.   The principal modifications set forth in the Employment Agreement are described below:
 
Term
.  The Employment Agreement commenced November 13, 2009, and will expire April 3, 2015, unless terminated earlier.  The term of Mr. Case's employment was thereby extended five years.
 
Salary and Bonus
.  No changes were made to Mr. Case's current annual base salary of $1,500,000.   Mr. Case is eligible for a target bonus of 200% (an increase from 150%) of base salary and a maximum bonus of 300% of the target bonus (an increase from 250% of base salary), subject to the current cap of $5 million established under the Company's Senior Officer Incentive Compensation Plan.  The Company's board of directors retains the discretion to determine Mr. Case's actual bonus payment.
 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation.
  The Employment Agreement no longer requires an annual award of $1.8 million in non-qualified stock options be granted by the Company to Mr. Case, a contractual requirement under the Prior Agreement that Mr. Case has annually waived.  Mr. Case will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company's long-term incentive compensation plans, such as its Leadership Performance Program ("LPP"), a sub-plan of the 2001 Aon Stock Incentive Plan. As a reflection of Mr. Case's exceptional performance to date and his commitment to the extended term as set forth in the Employment Agreement, he will receive an additional award valued at $10 million under the LPP for the performance period beginning January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2012.  This additional award will be earned based on the same performance criteria and weightings as the regular award the Company anticipates awarding to Mr. Case under the LPP for the same performance period.  The performance criteria and weightings will be the same as those applicable to other LPP award recipients.
 
Benefits.
  No changes were made to Mr. Case's eligibility for life insurance coverage of at least $5 million.  Mr. Case will be eligible to participate in the Company's other employee benefit programs on the same basis as provided currently under the Prior Agreement; however, he and his family will be eligible for coverage under the Company's retiree medical program if his employment terminates for any reason other than cause after he has attained age 50 and irrespective of his years of employment with the Company.
 
Noncompetition. 
The Employment Agreement modified the two-year noncompetition provision to prohibit Mr. Case's employment with an insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage or employee benefits brokerage business if such services represent at least 55% of such business' annual gross revenue, subject to additional restrictions.  Other restrictive covenants set forth in the Employment Agreement continue unchanged from those set forth in the Prior Agreement.
 
Termination Provisions
.
  The Employment Agreement contains no material changes to the termination provisions applicable to Mr. Case's employment as set forth in the Prior Agreement.
 
In addition, on November 13, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated change in control agreement (the "Change in Control Agreement") with Mr. Case, which modifies the existing severance agreement dated as of April 4, 2005 between the Company and Mr. Case (the "Prior Change in Control Agreement").  The terms of the Prior Change in Control Agreement were disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 5, 2005.  The Change in Control Agreement significantly reduces the financial protection to be afforded to Mr. Case in the event of the termination of his employment in connection with a change in control of the Company. The principal modifications are:
 
(1)
                                 
Complete elimination of the Company's obligation to provide a gross-up payment to Mr. Case in connection with excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and
 
(2)
                                 
Capping Mr. Case's cash and non-equity award payments to the "safe harbor" amount under Code Section 280G, such that the cash and non-equity award payments are not deemed to be "excess parachute payments".
 
The foregoing summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to each of the Employment Agreement and the Change in Control Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
A copy of the press release announcing the extension of Mr. Case's employment agreement is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 10.1
 
AMENDED AND RESTATED
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
 
This Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (this "Agreement") is dated as of November 13, 2009, between Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Gregory C. Case (the "Executive").
 
WHEREAS, on April 4, 2005 the Company entered into an employment agreement with Executive whereby Executive is employed as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "2005 Agreement"); and
 
WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain changes to the 2005 Agreement, including to extend the Employment Period, as set forth herein.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
            
Employment
.
  The Company will continue to employ the Executive, and the Executive will continue to be employed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement.  The extended term of employment of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement (the "Employment Period") shall commence effective as of November 13, 2009 (the "Effective Date") and shall end on April 3, 2015, unless earlier terminated pursuant to Section 4 hereof.
 
2.
            
Position and Duties; Responsibilities; Board Service
.
  (a)  .  The Company shall continue to employ the Executive during the Employment Period as its President and Chief Executive Officer.  During the Employment Period, the Executive shall continue to perform faithfully and loyally and to the best of his abilities the duties assigned to him hereunder and shall devote his full business time, attention and effort to the affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries and shall use his best efforts to promote the interests of the Company and its subsidiaries.  The Executive may engage in charitable, civic or community activities and, with the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), may serve as a director of any other business corporation, provided that (i) such activities or service do not interfere with his duties hereunder or violate the terms of any of the covenants contained in Sections 7, 8 or 9 hereof and (ii) such other business corporation provides the Executive with director and officer insurance coverage which, in the opinion of the Board, is adequate under the circumstances.
Position and Duties
 
(b)  .  Subject to the powers, authority and responsibilities vested in the Board and in duly constituted committees of the Board, the Executive shall continue to have the authority and responsibility for the management, operation and overall conduct of the business of the Company.  The Executive shall also perform such other duties (not inconsistent with the position of Chief Executive Officer) on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries as may from time to time be authorized or directed by the Board.  The Executive shall continue to report to the Board.
Responsibilities
 
 
(c)  .  Effective April 4, 2005,  the Executive was appointed as a member of the Board, and he was duly elected as a member of the Board at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders on May 20, 2005.  Provided that the Executive's employment with the Company has not previously been terminated, the Executive will be nominated for reelection as a member of the Board at the Company's 2010 annual meeting of shareholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of shareholders during the Employment Period.  If so re-elected, the Executive agrees that he will serve as a member of the Board.
Board Service
 
3.
            
Compensation
.
  (a)  .  During the Employment Period, the Company shall pay to the Executive a base salary at the rate of $1,500,000 per annum ("Base Salary"), payable semi-monthly in accordance with the Company's executive payroll policy.  Such Base Salary shall be reviewed annually on the Company's regular executive salary review schedule, and shall be subject to adjustment at the discretion of the Board.
Base Salary
 
(b)  .  During the Employment Period, the Executive shall participate in one or more annual incentive bonus plans (collectively, the "Senior Executive Plan").  Each such annual incentive bonus shall be determined pursuant to the terms of the Senior Executive Plan as in effect from time to time; provided, however, that (i) the Executive's target annual incentive bonus for calendar year 2009 and subsequent years shall not be less than 200% of the Executive's Base Salary as in effect at the end of the fiscal year to which such annual incentive bonus relates (the "Bonus Year"), (ii) the Executive shall be eligible to earn an annual incentive bonus of up to 300% of the Executive's target annual incentive bonus as in effect at the end of the Bonus Year, (iii) the annual incentive bonuses earned hereunder will be subject to payment pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the Aon Incentive Stock Program, a sub-plan of the stockholder-approved 2001 Aon Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"), payable currently in a combination of cash and restricted stock units of Aon Corporation common stock.    The portion of the annual incentive bonus paid in cash shall be paid following the end of the calendar year for which the bonus is awarded and no later than two and one-half months after the end of the calendar year for which awarded.
Annual Bonus
 
(c)  .  Subject to the approval of the Board on or before March 31, 2010, the Executive shall receive an additional award pursuant to the Company's Leadership Performance Program, a sub-plan of the Stock Plan, for the performance period beginning January 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2012.  Such additional award shall have a grant date target value of $10 million.  It is intended that such award value will reflect the Executive's exceptional performance to date and his commitment to the extended Employment Period set forth herein.  The $10 million value will be in addition to the value to be otherwise granted pursuant to the Company's regular annual long-term incentive award process, and will be earned based on the same performance criteria and weightings as the regular award, which also will be the same for other corporate participants for the performance period.
Equity-Based Awards
 
(d)    .  During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's employee benefit plans generally available to executives of the Company (such benefits being hereinafter referred to as the "Employee Benefits"); provided that life insurance coverage shall be no less than $5 million.  The Executive also shall be entitled to take time off for vacation or illness in accordance with the Company's policy for executives and to receive all other fringe benefits as are from time to time made generally
Other Benefits
 
available to executives of the Company who are domiciled in the United States.  If the Executive's termination of employment occurs for any reason, other than by the Company for Cause pursuant to Section 4(c), after the Executive has attained at least age 50 and irrespective of the Executive's years of continuous employment with the Company, the Executive and the Executive's spouse and dependent children shall be eligible for coverage under the Company's retiree medical program, as such program may be amended, excluding any amendment of the age and service eligibility requirements, from time to time (the "Retiree Medical Plan"). The Company's share of the cost of continuation of coverage under any self-insured medical reimbursement program that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), will be included in the Executive's taxable income from the Company.
 
(e)  .  During the Employment Period the Company shall reimburse the Executive in accordance with the Company's policies and procedures, for all proper expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties hereunder.  The Company shall pay the reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement in an amount not to exceed $25,000.  Payment or reimbursement of expenses described in this Agreement, including in connection with the Executive's Employee Benefits, shall be made promptly and in no event later than December 31 of the year following the year in which such expenses were incurred, and the amount of such expenses eligible for payment or reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, in any year shall not affect the amount of such expenses eligible for payment or reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other year, except for any limit on the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed under an arrangement described in Code Section 105(b).

any violation of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
(iii)
                            
The exercise of the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall not abrogate the rights or remedies of the Company in respect of the breach giving rise to such termination.
 
(iv)
                            
If the Company terminates the Executive's employment for Cause, the Executive's entitlement to compensation and benefits shall cease immediately, except that the Executive shall be entitled to the payments and benefits specified in Sections 4(b)(i) and 4(b)(iv) hereof.
 
(v)
                              
If the Company terminates the Executive's employment for Cause, the Executive agrees to immediately resign from the Board.
 
(d)
                               
Termination Without Cause

The Company may, at its option, terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement upon written notice to the Executive for a reason other than a reason set forth in Section 4(a), 4(b) or 4(c).

(iv)
                             
the treatment of the restricted stock units granted to the Executive pursuant to Section 3(c) of the 2005 Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof;

(ii)  As used in this Agreement, the term "Good Reason" shall mean during the Employment Period, without the written consent of the Executive, any one or more of the following, provided that an isolated, insubstantial or inadvertent action not taken in bad faith or failure not occurring in bad faith which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive shall not constitute Good Reason:
 
(A)
         
the assignment to the Executive of any duties materially inconsistent in any respect with the Executive's position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by this Agreement;

Time and Form of Payment
.  For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "terminated", "termination", "termination of employment", and variations thereof, as used in this Agreement, are intended to mean a termination of employment that constitutes a "separation from service" under Code Section 409A.  The time and form of payment of benefits upon termination of employment described in the preceding provisions of this Section 4 (including expense reimbursements or payment and in-kind benefits) shall be made in accordance with such Section; provided that the lump sum cash payments shall be paid 60 days following the Executive's termination of employment; and provided further, with respect to termination of employment for reasons other than death, the payment at such time can be characterized as a "short-term deferral" for purposes of Code Section 409A or as otherwise exempt from the provisions of Code Section 409A, or if any portion of the payment cannot be so characterized, and the Executive is a "specified employee" under Code Section 409A, such portion of the payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six
 
months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment (the "Delay Period").  Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 4(g) shall be paid or reimbursed to the Executive in a lump sum, and any remaining payments due under the preceding provisions of this Section 4, whichever is applicable, shall be payable at the same time and in the same form as such amounts or benefits would have been paid in accordance with their original payment schedule under such Section.  If the Executive is a "specified employee" under Code Section 409A, the full cost of the continuation or provision of Employee Benefits (other than any cost of medical or dental benefit plans or programs or the cost of any other plan or program that is exempt from Code Section 409A) under Section 4(d) and 4(f) shall be paid by the Executive until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment, and such cost shall be reimbursed by the Company to, or on behalf of, the Executive in a lump sum cash payment on the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following Executive's termination of employment.  For purposes of applying the provisions of Section 409A, each separately identified amount to which the Executive is entitled shall be treated as a separate payment.

Payments and Benefits Upon Termination of Employment
.  If during the Termination Period the employment of the Executive shall terminate, other than by reason of a Nonqualifying Termination, and the Executive (or the Executive's executor or other legal representative in the case of the Executive's death or disability following such termination) executes a noncompetition, nonsolicitation and confidentiality agreement and release of claims substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Noncompetition Agreement and Release") within 45 days following the Termination Date, the Company shall provide to the Executive, as compensation for services rendered to the Company, and in consideration of the covenants set forth in the Noncompetition Agreement and Release, the payments and benefits described in this Section 3.  The Executive shall forfeit the payments and benefits described in this Section 3 in the event that the Executive fails to execute and deliver the Noncompetition Agreement and Release to the Company in accordance with the timing and other provisions of the preceding sentence or revokes such Noncompetition Agreement and Release prior to the date the release of claims contained therein becomes effective.  For purposes of this Agreement, the Executive shall be considered to have a termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries on the date the Executive has a "separation from service" as described under Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and Treasury regulations issued thereunder with the Company and its subsidiaries.  Any amount paid pursuant to this Section 3 shall be paid in lieu of any other severance payments or benefits, which benefits may, without limitation, include pay in lieu of notice, salary continuation through a contractual notice period or enhanced supplemental pension benefits conferred, in any event as a result of termination of employment, from the Company or any of its subsidiaries which are not payable pursuant to this Agreement, but are payable pursuant to an employment agreement or other compensation arrangement entered into between the Executive and the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
(a)

th
 day following the later to occur of the Termination Date or the Change in Control:
 
(1)
                                 
a cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) equal to the sum of (i) the Executive's full annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies through the Termination Date, to the extent not theretofore paid, (ii) the average of the Executive's annual cash incentive for each of the three fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Termination Date
 
occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs and the denominator of which is 365 or 366, as applicable, and (iii) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid; plus
 
(2)
                                 
a lump sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) in an amount equal to three (3) times the sum of (i) the Executive's highest annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies in effect during the 12-month period prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the Executive's target annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs; plus
 
(3)
                                 
a lump sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) in an amount equal to the amount forfeited by the Executive under any qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a result of the Executive's termination of employment.
 
(b)
                                
The Executive shall become fully (100%) vested in the Executive's accrued benefits under the Aon Corporation Excess Benefit Plan, the Aon Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan and the Aon Corporation Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or successor plans in effect on the date of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Nonqualified Plans").  The Executive's accrued benefits under the Aon Corporation Excess Benefit Plan or the Aon Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan, whichever plan is applicable to the Executive on the date of the Executive's termination of employment, shall be determined by crediting the Executive with three (3) additional years of age and service credits and, in the case of the Aon Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan, three (3) additional years of Retirement Plan Contributions.  Within 30 days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum cash amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the Executive's accrued benefits under the Nonqualified Plans, determined as of the Executive's Termination Date, notwithstanding anything contained in the Nonqualified Plans to the contrary.  Such lump sum cash payment shall be computed in the case of the Aon Corporation Excess Benefit Plan using the same actuarial assumptions then in use for purposes of computing benefits under the plan, provided that the interest rate used in making such computations shall not be greater than the interest rate permitted under section 417(c) of the Code on the date of the Change in Control.
 
(c)
                                 
For the period commencing on the Termination Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the date which is three (3) years following the Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the Executive becomes eligible to participate in and receive medical, dental and life insurance benefits under a plan or arrangement sponsored by another employer having benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits provided pursuant to this Section 3(c), the Company shall continue the Executive's medical, dental and life insurance coverage, under the Company-sponsored plans or otherwise, upon the same terms and otherwise to the same extent as such coverage shall have been in effect immediately prior to the Executive's Termination Date, and the Company and the Executive shall share the costs of the continuation of such medical, dental and life insurance coverage in the same proportion as such costs were shared immediately prior
 
to the Termination Date; provided, the Company's share of the cost of the continuation of coverage under any self-insured medical reimbursement plan that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Code shall be included in the Executive's taxable income from the Company.  Such continuation of medical and dental coverage shall be in satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  Payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall be made promptly and in no event later than December 31 of the year following the year in which such expenses were incurred, and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, in any year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other year, except for any limit on the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed under an arrangement described in Section 105(b) of the Code.  Additionally, such right to payment or reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  If the Executive is a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code, the full cost of the continuation or provision of employee benefits described under this Section 3(c) (other than any cost of medical or dental benefit plans or programs or the cost of any other plan or program that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code) shall be paid by the Executive until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment, and such cost shall be reimbursed by the Company or the applicable subsidiary to, or on behalf of, the Executive in a lump sum cash payment on the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment.

Vesting of Equity Awards Upon Termination Date; Exercise Period
.  Immediately upon the Executive's Termination Date, all stock options and other equity awards, if any, granted by the Company to the Executive (or stock options and other equity awards granted in substitution therefor by an acquiror of, or successor to, the Company) that are not otherwise exercisable or vested shall become exercisable and vested in full in accordance with the applicable plan documents and award agreements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Section 4, including but not limited to any restricted stock unit or other equity-based award, payment or amount that provides for the "deferral of compensation" (as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code), may not be accelerated except as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and Treasury regulations issued thereunder.  With respect to any and all outstanding stock options granted by the Company to the Executive, each such option shall remain exercisable following the Executive's termination of employment until and including the expiration date of the term of the option (as set forth in the written agreement relating to such option).

  (a) The definitions in subsection (e) of this Section apply to the provisions in subsections (b) through (d) of this Section.
 
(b)
                                
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any Payments to the Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Company shall either (i) eliminate all Non-Equity Award Payments, if the Excise Tax would apply despite the elimination of all Non-Equity Award Payments, or (ii) if a reduction in Non-Equity Award
 
Payments would eliminate the Excise Tax, reduce the amount of Non-Equity Award Payments by the least amount that causes none of the Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax.  If a reduction in the Non-Equity Award Payments is necessary so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount and none of the Non-Equity Award Payments is Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, then the reduction shall occur in the manner the Executive elects in writing prior to the date of payment.  If any Non-Equity Award Payment constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation or the Executive fails to elect an order, then the reduction shall occur in the following order:  (i) reduction in the benefits described in Sections 3(b) and 3(c) hereof (with such reduction being applied to the benefits in the manner having the least economic impact to the Executive and, to the extent the economic impact is equivalent, such benefits shall be reduced in the reverse order of when the benefits would have been provided to the Executive, that is, benefits payable later shall be reduced before benefits payable earlier); and (ii) reduction of cash payments described in Section 3(a) hereof (with such reduction being applied to the payments in reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments).
 
(c)
                                 
To the extent that any Equity Award Payments to the Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax after application of sub-section 5(b) above, and if a reduction would provide the Executive with a greater after-tax amount than if a reduction in Equity Award Payments did not occur, then the Company shall reduce the amount of the Equity Award Payments by the least amount that would provide the Executive with such greater after-tax amount.
 
(d)
                                
All determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether and when Payments are to be reduced so that Payments are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount and the amount of such reduction and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the public accounting firm that is retained by the Company as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Company or the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the Board shall determine prior to the Change in Control that the Accounting Firm is precluded from performing such services under applicable auditor independence rules or (ii) the Audit Committee of the Board determines that it does not want the Accounting Firm to perform such services because of auditor independence concerns or (iii) the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Board shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the costs of retaining experts) of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.  If Payments are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount or the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive without a reduction in Payments, the Accounting Firm shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion to the effect that the Executive is not required to report any Excise Tax on the Executive's federal income tax return, and that the failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.
 
(e)

(iv)  "Non-Equity Award Payment" means any payment to the Executive other than an Equity Award Payment.
 
(v)  "Parachute Value" of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the change of control from purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2), as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
 
(vi)  A "Payment" means any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

or portion thereof, under Section 3(a) of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with Section 3(a).
 
(b)  In the event that any payment or distribution or portion of any payment or distribution to be made to the Executive hereunder cannot be characterized as a "short term deferral" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, or is not otherwise exempt from the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, and the Executive is determined to be a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code, such portion of the payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date which is six months and one day following the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Delay Period").

For purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such merger, consolidation or transfer becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.

Payments and Benefits Upon Termination of Employment
.  If during the Termination Period the employment of the Executive shall terminate, other than by reason of a Nonqualifying Termination, and the Executive (or the Executive's executor or other legal representative in the case of the Executive's death or disability following such termination) executes a noncompetition, nonsolicitation and confidentiality agreement and release of claims substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Noncompetition Agreement and Release") within 45 days following the Termination Date, the Company shall provide to the Executive, as compensation for services rendered to the Company, and in consideration of the covenants set forth in the Noncompetition Agreement and Release, the payments and benefits described in this Section 3.

th
 day following the later to occur of the Termination Date or the Change in Control:
 
(1)
                                 
a cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) equal to the sum of (i) the Executive's full annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies through the Termination Date, to the extent not theretofore paid, (ii) the average of the Executive's annual cash incentive for each of the three fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs and the denominator of which is 365 or 366, as applicable, and (iii) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid; plus
 
(2)
                                 
a lump sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) in an amount equal to three (3) times the sum of (i) the Executive's highest annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies in effect during the 12-month period prior to the Termination Date and (ii) the Executive's target annual incentive bonus for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs; plus
 
(3)
                                 
a lump sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) in an amount equal to the amount forfeited by the Executive under any qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a result of the Executive's termination of employment.
 
(b)
                                
The Executive shall become fully (100%) vested in the Executive's accrued benefits under the Aon Corporation Excess Benefit Plan, the Aon Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan and the Aon Corporation Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or successor plans in effect on the date of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Nonqualified Plans").  The Executive's accrued benefits under the Aon Corporation Excess Benefit Plan or the Aon Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan, whichever plan is applicable to the Executive on the date of the Executive's termination of employment, shall be determined by crediting the Executive with three (3) additional years of age and service credits and, in the case of the Aon Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan, three (3) additional years of Retirement Plan Contributions.  Within 30 days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay to the Executive a lump sum cash amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the Executive's accrued benefits under the Nonqualified Plans, determined as of the Executive's Termination Date, notwithstanding anything contained in the Nonqualified Plans to the contrary.  Such lump sum cash payment shall be computed in the case of the Aon Corporation Excess Benefit Plan using the same actuarial assumptions then in use for purposes of computing benefits under the plan, provided that the interest rate used in making such computations shall not be greater than the interest rate permitted under section 417(c) of the Code on the date of the Change in Control.
 
(c)
                                 
For the period commencing on the Termination Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the date which is three (3) years following the Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the Executive becomes eligible to participate in and receive medical, dental and life insurance benefits under a plan or arrangement sponsored by another employer having benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits provided pursuant to this Section 3(c), the Company shall continue the Executive's medical, dental and life insurance coverage, under the Company-sponsored plans or otherwise, upon the same terms and otherwise to the same extent as such coverage shall have been in effect immediately prior to the Executive's Termination Date, and the Company and the Executive shall share the costs of the continuation of such medical, dental and life insurance coverage in the same proportion as such costs were shared immediately prior to the Termination Date; provided, the Company's share of the cost of the continuation of coverage under any self-insured medical reimbursement plan that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Code shall be included in the Executive's taxable income from the Company.  Such continuation of medical and dental coverage shall be in satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).
 
Payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall be made promptly and in no event later than December 31 of the year following the year in which such expenses were incurred, and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, in any year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other year, except for any limit on the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed under an arrangement described in Section 105(b) of the Code.  Additionally, such right to payment or reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  If the Executive is a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code, the full cost of the continuation or provision of employee benefits described under this Section 3(c) (other than any cost of medical or dental benefit plans or programs or the cost of any other plan or program that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code) shall be paid by the Executive until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment, and such cost shall be reimbursed by the Company or the applicable subsidiary to, or on behalf of, the Executive in a lump sum cash payment on the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment.
 
4.
                                      
Vesting of Equity Awards Upon Termination Date; Exercise Period
.  Immediately upon the Executive's Termination Date, all stock options and other equity awards, if any, granted by the Company to the Executive (or stock options and other equity awards granted in substitution therefor by an acquiror of, or successor to, the Company) that are not otherwise exercisable or vested shall become exercisable and vested in full in accordance with the applicable plan documents and award agreements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Section 4, including but not limited to any restricted stock unit or other equity-based award, payment or amount that provides for the "deferral of compensation" (as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code), may not be accelerated except as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and Treasury regulations issued thereunder.  With respect to any and all outstanding stock options granted by the Company to the Executive, each such option shall remain exercisable following the Executive's termination of employment until and including the expiration date of the term of the option (as set forth in the written agreement relating to such option).
 
5.
                                      
Contingent Reduction of Parachute Payments.
  (a) The definitions in subsection (e) of this Section apply to the provisions in subsections (b) through (d) of this Section.
 
(b)
                                
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to the extent that any Payments to the Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax, then the Company shall either (i) eliminate all Non-Equity Award Payments, if the Excise Tax would apply despite the elimination of all Non-Equity Award Payments, or (ii) if a reduction in Non-Equity Award Payments would eliminate the Excise Tax, reduce the amount of Non-Equity Award Payments by the least amount that causes none of the Payments to be subject to the Excise Tax.  If a reduction in the Non-Equity Award Payments is necessary so that the Parachute Value (as defined below) of all Payments equals the Safe Harbor Amount and none of the Non-Equity Award Payments is Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, then the reduction shall occur in the
 
manner the Executive elects in writing prior to the date of payment.  If any Non-Equity Award Payment constitutes Nonqualified Deferred Compensation or the Executive fails to elect an order, then the reduction shall occur in the following order:  (i) reduction in the benefits described in Sections 3(b) and 3(c) hereof (with such reduction being applied to the benefits in the manner having the least economic impact to the Executive and, to the extent the economic impact is equivalent, such benefits shall be reduced in the reverse order of when the benefits would have been provided to the Executive, that is, benefits payable later shall be reduced before benefits payable earlier); and (ii) reduction of cash payments described in Section 3(a) hereof (with such reduction being applied to the payments in reverse order in which they would otherwise be made, that is, later payments shall be reduced before earlier payments).
 
(c)
                                 
To the extent that any Equity Award Payments to the Executive would be subject to the Excise Tax after application of sub-section 5(b) above, and if a reduction would provide the Executive with a greater after-tax amount than if a reduction in Equity Award Payments did not occur, then the Company shall reduce the amount of the Equity Award Payments by the least amount that would provide the Executive with such greater after-tax amount.
 
(d)
                                
All determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether and when Payments are to be reduced so that Payments are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount and the amount of such reduction and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by the public accounting firm that is retained by the Company as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the receipt of notice from the Company or the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the Board shall determine prior to the Change in Control that the Accounting Firm is precluded from performing such services under applicable auditor independence rules or (ii) the Audit Committee of the Board determines that it does not want the Accounting Firm to perform such services because of auditor independence concerns or (iii) the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Board shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the costs of retaining experts) of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.  If Payments are reduced to the Safe Harbor Amount or the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive without a reduction in Payments, the Accounting Firm shall furnish the Executive with a written opinion to the effect that the Executive is not required to report any Excise Tax on the Executive's federal income tax return, and that the failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive.
 
(e)
                                 
The following terms shall have the following meanings for purposes of this Section.
 
(i)  "Equity Award Payment" means any Payment to the Executive on account of awards of compensation to the Executive in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or other forms of award payable in or exercisable with respect to Company stock.
 
(ii)  "Excise Tax" means the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, together with any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such excise tax.
 
(iii)  "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" means any reimbursement, payment or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement or otherwise that constitutes a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to Section 409A of the Code.
 
(iv)  "Non-Equity Award Payment" means any payment to the Executive other than an Equity Award Payment.
 
(v)  "Parachute Value" of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the change of control from purposes of Section 280G of the Code of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b)(2), as determined by the Accounting Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment.
 
(vi)  A "Payment" means any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.
 
(vii)  The "Safe Harbor Amount" means the maximum Parachute Value of all Payments that an Executive can receive without any Payments being subject to the Excise Tax.
