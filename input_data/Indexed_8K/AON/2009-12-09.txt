The New Credit Agreement provides the Company with a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $400,000,000 for a term of three years that will mature on December 4, 2012.  The New Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, default provisions and affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants with respect to the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense (which may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0) and the ratio of borrowings to EBITDA (which may not be more than 3.0 to 1.0).
 
The Company did not draw on the credit facility after entering into the New Credit Agreement.

The Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and certain of the Lenders, as well as certain of their respective affiliates, have performed, and may, in the future, perform for the Company and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting, and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees and expenses.  In addition, the Company and certain of its affiliates have performed, and may perform, various insurance brokerage and consulting services for the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and certain of the Lenders.
 
The foregoing summary of the New Credit Agreement contained in this Section 1.01 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and provisions of the New Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02.  Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

The credit facility available to the Company under the Previous Credit Agreement was undrawn at the time of its termination.
