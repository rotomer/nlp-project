Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Agreement and Plan of Merger
 
On July 11, 2010, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Aon"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Hewitt Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Hewitt"), Alps Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Aon ("Merger Sub"), and Alps Merger LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Aon ("Merger LLC").  The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Hewitt, with Hewitt surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon (the "Merger"), and (ii) following the completion of the Merger, the surviving corporation from the Merger will merge with and into Merger LLC (the "Subsequent Merger"), with Merger LLC surviving the Subsequent Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved and adopted by the boards of directors of each of Aon and Hewitt, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"),
each share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Hewitt ("Hewitt Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will convert into, at the election of each of the holders of Hewitt Common Stock, (i) 0.6362 of a share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Aon ("Aon Common Stock"), and $25.61 in cash (the "Mixed Consideration"), (ii) an amount of cash (the "Cash Consideration") equal to the sum of (a) $25.61 and (b) the product obtained by multiplying 0.6362 by the Closing Volume-Weighted Average Price (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or (iii) a number of shares of Aon Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration") equal to the sum of (a) 0.6362 and (b) the quotient obtained by dividing $25.61 by the Closing Volume-Weighted Average Price (the "Exchange Ratio").  Holders of Hewitt Common Stock who do not make an election will receive the Mixed Consideration.  The consideration to be paid to holders of Hewitt Common Stock electing to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration in connection with the Merger is subject, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, to automatic adjustment, as applicable, to ensure that the amount of cash paid and the number of shares of Aon Common Stock issued by Aon in the Merger each represents approximately 50% of the aggregate merger consideration (taking into account the roll-over of Hewitt options, as described below).  No fractional shares of Aon Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and holders of Hewitt Common Stock will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Aon Common Stock.
 
In connection with the Merger, each outstanding unvested Hewitt stock option will fully vest, and, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, each outstanding Hewitt stock option will be converted into an option to purchase Aon Common Stock, with the same terms and conditions (but taking into account any changes, including any acceleration or vesting of such option, by reason of the Merger), with adjustments to reflect the Exchange Ratio.  Shares of Hewitt restricted stock will vest and be converted into the Mixed Consideration, and restricted stock units of Hewitt and performance share units of Hewitt will be settled in Hewitt common stock and then converted into the Mixed Consideration.
 
The closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) approval and adoption by Hewitt stockholders of the Merger Agreement, (ii) approval by Aon stockholders of the issuance of Aon Common Stock in connection with the Merger, (iii) the
 
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and certain approvals by foreign governmental entities, (iv) no court order prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (v) receipt of tax opinions from counsel to each of Aon and Hewitt with respect to the treatment of the Merger and Subsequent Merger from a tax perspective, (vi) no exercise of appraisal rights by more than 12.5% of Hewitt stockholders and (vii) subject to materiality exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by Aon, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, on the one hand, and Hewitt, on the other hand, and compliance by Aon, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and Hewitt with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.
 
Each of Aon and Hewitt has made representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement.  Hewitt has agreed to certain covenants and agreements, including, among others, (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (ii) not to solicit alternate transactions and (iii) to call and hold a special stockholders' meeting and recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement.  Aon has also agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among other things, (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course of business during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger and (ii) to call and hold a special stockholders' meeting to approve the issuance of Aon Common Stock in connection with the Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement contains specified termination rights for both Aon and Hewitt.  If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Hewitt must pay Aon a termination fee of $85 million or $190 million, as applicable.  If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain other specified circumstances, Aon must pay Hewitt a termination fee of $190 million or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances relating to Aon's failure to obtain the requisite financing for the Merger, a termination fee of $225 million.
 
The Merger and the Subsequent Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes along with the other transactions effected pursuant to the Merger Agreement, are intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 
The Merger Agreement also provides that, at the Effective Time, the board of directors of Aon will consist of the fourteen current Aon directors and two directors mutually agreed upon by Aon and Hewitt.
 
The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby contained in this Item 1.01 does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Merger Agreement has been included in this communication to provide investors and stockholders with information regarding its terms.  It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Aon, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or Hewitt.  The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
 
Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors.  Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Aon, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or Hewitt or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Aon's or Hewitt's public disclosures.
 
Debt Commitment Letter
 
Concurrently, and in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Aon entered into a commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment Letter") with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch ("Credit Suisse"), Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ("CS Securities") and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. ("Morgan Stanley") pursuant to which, subject to the conditions set forth therein, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley committed to provide an unsecured term loan financing of up to $1.0 billion (the "Term Loan Facility") and an unsecured bridge financing of up to $1.5 billion (the "Bridge Facility" and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the "Facilities").  Aon has the option to issue up to $1.5 billion in senior notes in lieu of all or a portion of the drawing under the Bridge Facility or to refinance all or a portion of the Bridge Facility at a later date. The proceeds from these borrowings or issuances will be used by Aon to pay a portion of the cash consideration to be paid in the Merger, to refinance existing indebtedness of Hewitt and its subsidiaries and to pay related fees and expenses.  Pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, CS Securities and Morgan Stanley will act as joint lead arrangers and bookrunners for each of the Facilities, Credit Suisse, acting through one or more of its branches or affiliates, will act as administrative agent for each of the Facilities, and Morgan Stanley will act as syndication agent for each of the Facilities.  The Term Loan Facility will mature three years following the Effective Time, and the Bridge Facility will mature 364 days following the Effective Time.  The Debt Commitment Letter provides, among other things, that the closings of the Term Loan Facility and the Bridge Facility are subject to certain conditions.
 
The foregoing summary of the Debt Commitment Letter and the transactions contemplated thereby contained in this Item 1.01 does not purport to be a complete description and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
