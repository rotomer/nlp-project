On August 9, 2010, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Aon"), established the date for a special meeting of its stockholders to consider and vote on a proposal to issue shares of Aon common stock to stockholders of Hewitt Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Hewitt"), pursuant to the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 11, 2010 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Aon, Alps Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Aon ("Merger Sub"), and Alps Merger LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Aon ("Merger LLC").  The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into Hewitt, with Hewitt surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon (the "Merger"), and (ii) following the completion of the Merger, the surviving corporation from the Merger will merge with and into Merger LLC (the "Subsequent Merger"), with Merger LLC surviving the Subsequent Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon.  In addition to the approval of Hewitt's and Aon's stockholders, the completion of the transaction is subject to various customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals (including approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and certain approvals by foreign governmental entities).
 
The special meeting of stockholders of Aon will be held on September 20, 2010.  All Aon stockholders of record at the close of business on August 16, 2010, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting.

Potential factors that could impact results include: the possibility that the expected efficiencies and cost savings from the proposed transaction will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period; the ability to obtain governmental approvals of the merger on the proposed terms and schedule contemplated by the parties; the failure of stockholders of Hewitt to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; the failure of the stockholders of Aon to approve the proposal to approve the issuance of shares of Aon common stock to Hewitt stockholders in the merger; the loss of key Aon or Hewitt employees following the merger; the risk that the Aon and Hewitt businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the proposed transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships with customers, partners and others; the possibility that the proposed transaction does not close, including, but not limited to, due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; general economic conditions in different countries in which Aon and Hewitt do business around the world; changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets; fluctuations in exchange and interest rates that could impact revenue and expense; rating agency actions that could affect Aon's ability to borrow funds; changes in the funding status of Aon's various defined benefit pension plans and the impact of any increased pension funding resulting from those changes; Aon's ability to implement restructuring initiatives and other initiatives intended to yield cost savings, and the ability to achieve those cost savings; the impact on risk and insurance services commission revenues of changes in the availability of, and the premium insurance carriers charge for, insurance and reinsurance products, including the impact on premium rates and market capacity attributable to catastrophic events; the outcome of inquiries from regulators and investigations related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws; the impact of investigations brought by U.S. state attorneys general, U.S. state insurance regulators, U.S. federal prosecutors, U.S. federal regulators, and regulatory authorities in the U.K. and other countries; the impact of class actions and individual lawsuits including client class actions, securities class actions, derivative actions and ERISA class actions; the cost of resolution of other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies, including potential liabilities arising from error and omissions claims against Aon or Hewitt; the extent to which Aon and Hewitt retain existing clients and attract new businesses; the extent to which
 
Aon and Hewitt manage certain risks created in connection with the various services, including fiduciary and advisory services, among others, that Aon and Hewitt currently provide, or will provide in the future, to clients; the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which Aon and Hewitt operate, particularly given the global scope of Aon's and Hewitt's businesses and the possibility of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions in which Aon and Hewitt do business; and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits to Aon of the Benfield merger.  Further information concerning Aon, Hewitt, and their business, including factors that potentially could materially affect Aon's and Hewitt's financial results, is contained in Aon's and Hewitt's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
