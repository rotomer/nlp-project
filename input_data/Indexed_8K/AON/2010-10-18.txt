In addition, the Company and certain of its affiliates have performed, and may perform, various insurance brokerage and consulting services for the institutions serving as Arranger and Agent and with certain of the lenders.

agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of a Borrower not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.

Continuing guarantee
 
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part or any increase of the Commitments, and this guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection.

Reinstatement
 
If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of the Company under this Clause 18 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.
 
18.4

(a)
           
any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;
(b)
          
the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;
 
(c)

any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;

any insolvency or similar proceedings.

Immediate recourse
 
The Company waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from the Company under this Clause 18.  This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary.
 
18.6
      
Appropriations
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
 
(a)
           
refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and the Company shall not be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
 
(b)
          
hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from the Company or on account of the Company's liability under this Clause 18.

Deferral of Company's rights
 
Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Agent otherwise directs, the Company will not exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 18:
(a)
           
to be indemnified by an Obligor;

to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;

(d)
          
to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which the Company has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 18.1 ();
Guarantee and indemnity
 
(e)
           
to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
 
(f)
           
to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.
 
If the Company receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Agent or as the Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 29 ().

(a)
                                  
any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and
 
(b)
                                 
in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,
 
except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:
 
(i)
                                 
release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or
 
(ii)

Accrued Amounts
 
(b)
                                 
the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts, so that, for the avoidance of doubt:
 
(i)
                                 
when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable to the Existing Lender; and
 
(ii)
                              
the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Clause 24.9, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

Dear Sirs
 
1.
                                
We refer to the Agreement. This is a Utilisation Request. Terms defined in the Agreement have the same meaning in this Utilisation Request unless given a different meaning in this Utilisation Request.
 
2.
                                
We wish to borrow a Loan on the following terms:
 
 
3.
                                
We confirm that each condition specified in Clause 4.2 () is satisfied on the date of this Utilisation Request.
Further conditions precedent
 
4.
                                
The proceeds of this Loan should be credited to [account].
 
5.
                                
This Utilisation Request is irrevocable.
 
 
 
 
1.
                                
The Mandatory Cost is an addition to the interest rate to compensate Lenders for the cost of compliance with (a) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (b) the requirements of the European Central Bank.
 
2.
                                
On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "") for each Lender, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Mandatory Cost will be calculated by the Agent as a weighted average of the Lenders' Additional Cost Rates (weighted in proportion to the percentage participation of each Lender in the relevant Loan) and will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
Additional Cost Rate
 
3.
                                
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in a Participating Member State will be the percentage notified by that Lender to the Agent. This percentage will be certified by that Lender in its notice to the Agent to be its reasonable determination of the cost (expressed as a percentage of that Lender's participation in all Loans made from that Facility Office) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank in respect of loans made from that Facility Office.
 
4.
                                
The Additional Cost Rate for any Lender lending from a Facility Office in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Agent as follows:
 
(a)          in relation to a sterling Loan:
 
 
(b)          in relation to a Loan in any currency other than sterling:
 
 
Where:
 
A
                                           
is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which that Lender is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
 
B
                                             
is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Margin and the Mandatory Cost and, if the Loan is an Unpaid Sum, the additional rate of interest specified in paragraph (a) of Clause 9.3 ()) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Loan.
Default interest
 
C
                                             
is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which that Lender is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
 
D
                                            
is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Agent on interest bearing Special Deposits.
 
E
                                              
is designed to compensate Lenders for amounts payable under the Fees Rules and is calculated by the Agent as being the average of the most recent rates of charge supplied by the Reference Banks to the Agent pursuant to paragraph 7 below and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000.
 
5.

In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e. 5 per cent will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).  A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.  The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
 
7.
                                
If requested by the Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the Financial Services Authority, supply to the Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per 1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.
 
8.
                                
Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Agent for the purpose of calculating its Additional Cost Rate.  In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following information on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender:
 
(a)
                              
the jurisdiction of its Facility Office; and
 
(b)
                             
any other information that the Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Agent of any change to the information provided by it pursuant to this paragraph.
 
9.
                                
The percentages of each Lender for the purpose of A and C above and the rates of charge of each Reference Bank for the purpose of E above shall be determined by the Agent based upon the information supplied to it pursuant to paragraphs 7 and 8 above and on the assumption that,
 
unless a Lender notifies the Agent to the contrary, each Lender's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits and Special Deposits are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a Facility Office in the same jurisdiction as its Facility Office.
 
10.
                          
The Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Additional Cost Rate which over or under compensates any Lender and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by any Lender or Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above is true and correct in all respects.
 
11.
                          
The Agent shall distribute the additional amounts received as a result of the Mandatory Cost to the Lenders on the basis of the Additional Cost Rate for each Lender based on the information provided by each Lender and each Reference Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3, 7 and 8 above.
 
12.
                          
Any determination by the Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Mandatory Cost, an Additional Cost Rate or any amount payable to a Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all Parties.
 
13.
                          
The Agent may from time to time, after consultation with the Company and the Lenders, determine and notify to all Parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Schedule in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all Parties.
