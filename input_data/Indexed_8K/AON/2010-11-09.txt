On November 5, 2010 (the "Effective Date"), Aon Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Transition Agreement (the "Transition Agreement") with Andrew M. Appel, the Company's Chief Operating Officer and one of its named executive officers, regarding Mr. Appel's resignation as the Company's Chief Operating Officer and his transition from the Company.
 
On November 9, 2010, the Company issued a press release related to this event, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(e)
 
In connection with Mr. Appel's transition, the terms of the Transition Agreement provide that the Company has notified Mr. Appel that it will terminate his employment without cause effective as of December 31, 2010 (the "Termination Date").  As of the Effective Date, Mr. Appel resigned his position as the Company's Chief Operating Officer, as an officer of any of its affiliates, and as a member of the Company's management executive committee.
 
The Transition Agreement also provides that during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the Termination Date (the "Transition Period"), Mr. Appel will perform certain transitional duties as requested by the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  During the Transition Period, Mr. Appel will continue to receive his base salary at a rate equal to $950,000 and Mr. Appel will continue to participate in the Company's retirement and health care plans and programs on the same terms as other employees.  Mr. Appel has waived entitlement to any annual incentive payment covering performance in calendar year 2010.
 
The Transition Agreement provides for the following additional compensation and benefits:  (i) a lump sum payment of $4,263,000, subject to applicable withholdings, on May 5, 2011; (ii) office and secretarial assistance through the earlier of the date he is re-employed elsewhere or September 30, 2011; (iii) provided Mr. Appel elects continuation health care coverage under COBRA, reimbursement for the difference between the premium rate he is required to pay and the active employee rate for similar coverage through September 30, 2011; (iv) reimbursement for up to $17,500 in reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and documentation of the Transition Agreement; and (v) standard executive-level outplacement assistance for the 2011 calendar year.
 
The compensation and benefits to Mr. Appel under the Transition Agreement are subject to his executing and not revoking a release of claims.  In addition, the Transition Agreement contains certain confidentiality provisions and restrictive covenants that impose additional restrictions on Mr. Appel, including non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that apply for a period of two years beginning January 1, 2011.

extent not yet then provided) under this Agreement, excluding the provision of welfare benefits (but subject to normal COBRA continuation rights).

In all other cases, if during the Transition Period the Company terminates the Executive's employment, other than for Cause, or in the event of the Executive's inability to perform his duties under this Agreement due to physical or mental illness, injury or other disability, the Executive shall be entitled to the compensation and benefits provided to him under this Agreement to the extent not yet then provided.  Such a termination shall be deemed a termination by the Company without Cause for purposes of the compensation and benefit arrangements of the Company not specifically governed by this Agreement.  For purposes of this Agreement the Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause if (i) the Executive fails or refuses to perform any duties reasonably assigned to him under Section 2, (ii) Executive breaches Section 7 or 8 of this Agreement or (iii) Executive is convicted of a felony.

(d)           The Executive shall be entitled, to the extent permitted under any applicable law, to select and change a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following his death by giving the Company written notice thereof.  In the event there is no such named beneficiary, or no surviving named beneficiary, such compensation and benefits shall be paid to the Executive's estate.  In the event of the Executive's death or a judicial determination of his incompetence, reference in this Agreement to the Executive shall be deemed, where appropriate, to refer to his beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.
 
13.           .  Any notices or other communications given hereunder by either party shall, in every case, be in writing and shall be deemed properly served if (a) delivered personally, (b) sent by registered or certified mail, in all such cases with first class postage prepaid, return receipt requested, (c) delivered to a nationally recognized overnight courier service or (d) sent by

The Company's current officers (including any vice presidents or above) and members of its current Board shall not, at any time following the date of this Agreement, make any public statements or publish any derogatory, unfavorable, negative, disparaging, false, damaging or deleterious written or oral statements or remarks (including without limitation, the repetition or distribution of derogatory rumors, allegations, or negative or unfavorable reports or comments) about the Executive.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the ability of Executive or the Company's officers or members of its Board to give truthful testimony pursuant to valid legal process, including but not limited to, a subpoena, court order or a government investigative matter.
No disparagement
 
15.           .  Section headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision herein.
Section Headings
 
16.           .  This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the parties and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous written or oral negotiations, commitments, understanding and agreements relating to the specific subject matter contained herein.  Any failure of the Company or the Executive to demand full and complete adherence to
Entire Agreement
 
one or more of this Agreement's terms, on one or more occasions, shall neither be construed as a waiver nor deprive such party of the right at any time to insist upon strict compliance.  The parties have entered into this Agreement in the belief that its provisions are valid, reasonable, and enforceable.  However, if any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall be held to be unenforceable for any reason, such unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.  This Agreement shall be construed according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against either of the parties hereto.  Any modification of this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto.  This Agreement shall supersede the Employment Agreement and any other agreement to which the Company and the Executive are a party regarding termination of his employment with the Company, including the Change in Control Agreement dated as of September 19, 2008 by and between Executive and the Company (the "change in Control Agreement") or severance plan or agreement.  Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Change in Control Agreement shall terminate and no longer be effective on the Effective Date.
 
17.           .  The parties hereto agree that the Company and its subsidiaries would be damaged irreparably in the event that any provisions of Section 7 or 8 of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages would be an inadequate remedy for any such nonperformance or breach.  Accordingly, the Company and its successors and permitted assigns shall be entitled, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, including liquidated damages provided herein, to an injunction or injunctions to prevent any breach or threatened breach of any such provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically (without posting a bond or other security).

20.           .  It is intended that any amounts payable under this Agreement and the Company's and Executive's exercise of authority or discretion hereunder shall comply with the provisions of Section 409A so as not to subject the Executive to the payment of interest or any tax penalty which may be imposed under Section 409A.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if, at the Executive's separation from service, (i) the Executive is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A and (ii) any of the payments or benefits provided hereunder constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A, then, and only to the extent required by such provisions, the date of payment of such payments or
Section 409A Compliance
 
benefits otherwise provided shall be delayed for a period of six (6) months following the separation from service.
