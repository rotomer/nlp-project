(e)
 
On December 7, 2010, Aon Corporation ("Aon") entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Stephen P. McGill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aon Risk Solutions.  The Employment Agreement modifies and supersedes the existing employment arrangement between Mr. McGill and Aon Limited, a U.K. subsidiary of Aon, dated April 22, 2005, and amended from time to time thereafter (the "Prior Arrangement").  The terms of the Prior Arrangement were filed as Exhibits to Aon's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and further disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 4, 2009.
 
The principal terms of the Employment Agreement are described below:
 
Permanent Relocation.
  Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. McGill agrees to permanently relocate his residence to the United States and become directly employed by Aon.  Under the Prior Arrangement, Mr. McGill had been serving as an expatriate to Aon's U.S. operations since 2006.
 
Term. 
The Employment Agreement commenced effective as of November 18, 2010, and will expire November 18, 2015, unless terminated earlier.
 
Salary and Bonus. 
 Aon will pay to Mr. McGill an annual base salary of $1,100,000.  Mr. McGill is eligible for a target bonus of 175% (an increase from 150%) of base salary.  The Organization and Compensation Committee of Aon's board of directors retains the discretion to determine Mr. McGill's actual bonus payment.
 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation. 
Mr. McGill will continue to be eligible to participate in Aon's long-term incentive compensation plans, such as the Leadership Performance Program ("LPP"), a sub-plan of the 2001 Aon Stock Incentive Plan.  As a reflection of Mr. McGill's exceptional performance to date and his commitment to the extended term as set forth in the Employment Agreement, he will receive an additional award valued at $6 million under the LPP for the performance period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2013.  This additional award will be earned based on the same performance criteria and weightings as the regular award Aon anticipates awarding to Mr. McGill under the LPP for the same performance period.  The performance criteria and weightings will be the same as those applicable to other LPP award recipients.
 
Benefits.
Mr. McGill will be eligible to participate in Aon's employee benefit plans generally available to senior executives of Aon.  Under the Prior Arrangement, Mr. McGill participated in the employee benefit programs available to U.K. employees of Aon Limited and other statutory benefit programs.
 
One-Time Transfer Payment. 
Mr. McGill will receive a one-time transfer payment of $2.5 million.  The payment will be made in recognition of his willingness to enter into the Employment Agreement, which will result in the elimination of expatriate benefits, including housing allowance, and Mr. McGill forfeiting his participation in certain U.K. employee benefits, including car allowance and pension contributions, and incurring relocation costs to permanently relocate to the U.S.  If Mr. McGill voluntarily terminates his employment with Aon prior to November 18, 2015, he will be obligated to repay to Aon a prorated amount of such payment.
 
Noncompetition. 
The Employment Agreement contains a noncompetition provision that prohibits Mr. McGill from competing with Aon for two years following the termination of his employment.  A two-year nonsolicitation provision also applies.  Under the Prior Arrangement, Mr. McGill would have been bound by restrictive covenants for one year following the termination of his employment.
 
Termination Severance Provisions. 
 Mr. McGill's employment agreement provides that, in the event of Mr. McGill's death during the term of the agreement, his estate will receive an amount equal to Mr. McGill's base salary at the date of death through November 18, 2015, and the amount of any benefit payable under any life insurance policy maintained by Aon for his benefit. In the event of Aon's termination of Mr. McGill's employment by reason of disability, he will receive an amount equal to the difference between Mr. McGill's base salary at the date of termination through November 18, 2015, and the projected amount of any benefit paid under any disability insurance policy maintained by Aon for his benefit.  In the event of a termination due to death or disability, Mr. McGill or his estate, as applicable, will receive a pro rata bonus for the year in which the termination of employment occurs equal to the total value of the bonus paid to Mr. McGill for the year prior to the year of termination multiplied by a ratio equal to the number of days Mr. McGill was employed during the year of termination divided by 365.
 
If Aon terminates Mr. McGill's employment for cause as set forth in his employment agreement, Mr. McGill will receive: (i) his accrued base salary through his date of termination; and (ii) other employee benefits to which he was entitled at the time of termination. If Aon terminates Mr. McGill's employment for any reason, other than for cause, or other than due to death or disability, Aon must give Mr. McGill 365 days prior written notice of termination, and he will be entitled to receive: (i) all accrued base salary and benefits as of the notice date; (ii) during such twelve-month notice period his base salary at the rate in effect as of the notice date through his date of termination; and (iii) a cash payment payable on the termination date in an amount equal to Mr. McGill's base salary as of the notice date.  If Mr. McGill voluntarily terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the agreement), he must give Aon ninety (90) days prior written notice and will be entitled to receive the payments and benefits set forth in items (i) through (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. If Mr. McGill voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason (other than for good reason), he will only receive: (i) his accrued base salary through his date of termination; and (ii) other employee benefits to which he was entitled at the time of termination.
 
In addition, on December 7, 2010, Aon entered into a Change in Control Agreement (the "Change in Control Agreement") with Mr. McGill, which modifies and supersedes the existing severance agreement dated as of September 19, 2008 (the "Prior Change in Control Agreement").  The Prior Change in Control Agreement was filed with the SEC as an Exhibit to Aon's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, and was a Tier 1 Agreement the terms of which are described in Aon's proxy statement for the 2010 annual meeting of stockholders.    The Change in Control Agreement significantly reduces the financial protection to be afforded to Mr. McGill in the event of the termination of his employment in connection with a change in control of Aon.  The material changes are:
 
1.
              
Complete elimination of Aon's obligation to provide a gross-up payment to Mr. McGill in connection with excise taxes imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and
 
2.
              
Capping Mr. McGill's payments and benefits under the Change in Control Agreement to the greater of (i) the "safe harbor" amount under Code Section 280G, such that the payments and benefits are not deemed to be "excess parachute payments" or (ii)  the amount of payments and benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Change in Control Agreement so long as the payments and benefits outweigh the tax consequence to Mr. McGill of receipt thereof.
 
The foregoing summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to each of the Employment Agreement and Change in Control Agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

WHEREAS, the Executive is currently employed as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Aon Risk Solutions pursuant to an employment agreement between the Executive and Aon Limited (a U.K. subsidiary of the Company) dated April 22, 2005, as amended from time to time (the "UK Agreement"); and
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to the UK Agreement, the Executive has been serving as an expatriate to the Company's U.S. operations since 2006; and
 
WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain changes to the Executive's employment arrangement, including the Executive's permanent move to the U.S., the direct employment of the Executive by the Company, and an extension of the term of the Executive's employment, as set forth herein.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:
 
1.
 
.
Employment Term; Title; Responsibilities; Outside Activities
 
(a)           The Company will employ the Executive as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Aon Risk Solutions, which position is currently directly below that of the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), and the Executive will be employed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement.  The extended term of Employment of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement (the "Term of Employment") will begin effective as of November 18, 2010 (the "Effective Date") and will end on the fifth anniversary thereof, unless renewed pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or terminated during the Term of Employment as fully set forth in Section 3.  It will not be a breach of this Agreement if the Executive's title is changed by the Company so long as the new title is a Level 1A senior executive role for the Company (or comparable level if levels are changed).
Employment Term; Title. 
 
(b)           The Executive will report to the CEO.  The Executive will have the authority and responsibility consistent with the position in which he will serve.  The Executive will also perform such other duties (not inconsistent with the Executive's title) on behalf of the Company and its subsidiaries as may from time to time be authorized or directed by the CEO.

Outside Activities.
Officer
(the "CEO"), may serve as a director of any other business corporation, provided that (i) such activities or service do not interfere with the Executive's duties hereunder or violate the terms of any of the covenants contained in Sections 4 or 6 hereof and (ii) such other business corporation provides the Executive with director and officer insurance coverage which, in the opinion of the CEO, is adequate under the circumstances.
2.
 
.
Compensation during Term of Employment
 
(a)             During the Term of Employment, the Company will pay to the Executive a base salary at the rate of $1,100,000 per year ("Base Salary"), payable semi-monthly in accordance with the Company's executive payroll policy.  Such Base Salary will be reviewed annually on the Company's regular executive salary review schedule, and will be subject to increase (but not decrease) at the discretion of the CEO and the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"), which increased amount will be thereafter the Executive's "Base Salary" for all purposes hereunder.
Base Salary.
 
(b)         The Executive will be eligible to participate in the annual incentive compensation program for the Company's senior executives in accordance with the provisions of such program, as amended from time to time.  For calendar years 2010 and 2011, the Executive's target bonus will be 175% of the Executive's Base Salary, and his maximum bonus will be three times target (unless a lesser maximum is established pursuant to the Company's incentive compensation program); provided, however, that for the remainder of the Term of Employment the Executive's target, maximum and actual bonus opportunity will be established in accordance with the provisions of the Company's annual incentive compensation program, as amended from time to time.  The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the annual incentive compensation awards earned hereunder will be subject to payment pursuant to and in accordance with the Aon Incentive Stock Program,payable in a combination of cash and restricted stock units of Aon Corporation common stock ("RSUs"), if applicable.
Annual Incentive Compensation.

Such additional award shall have a grant date target value of $6 million.  It is intended that such award value will reflect the Executive's exceptional performance to date and his commitment to the extended Term of Employment set forth herein.  The $6 million value will be in addition to the value to be otherwise granted pursuant to the Company's regular annual long-term incentive award process, and will be earned based on the same performance criteria and weightings as the regular award, which will also be the same for other corporate participants for the performance period.
Leadership Performance Program Award.
(d)        In connection with the Executive's willingness to enter into this Agreement, he will forfeit participation in expatriate allowances and certain valuable UK employee benefits that are not available hereunder and incur certain relocation costs to permanently relocate from the UK to the US.  The relocation costs include additional taxes to be incurred on the sale of his residence as a result of his move outside the European Union. In recognition of those factors, the Company will pay to the Executive a lump sum transfer payment of $2,500,000, less authorized deductions.  The payment will be made as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days, after the execution date of the Agreement.   If the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company pursuant to Section 3(b) hereof prior to fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, the Executive agrees and acknowledges that the Executive will re-pay promptly to the Company a pro-rata portion of such transfer payment, and the portion to be repaid will be calculated according to the following formula: (number of months remaining before the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date divided by 60) x $2,500,000.
One-Time Transfer Payment. 
 
(e)           During the course of employment, the Executive will be entitled to participate in the Company's employee benefit plans generally available to senior executives of the Company.  Nothing in this Agreement will require the Company to establish, maintain or continue any of the benefits already in existence or hereafter adopted for executives of the Company and nothing in this Agreement will restrict the right of the Company to amend, modify or terminate such programs.
Employee Benefits.
 
(f)          The Executive will be entitled to paid vacation time in accordance with usual Company policies and procedures. The Company will not pay the Executive any additional compensation for any vacation time not used by the Executive except as required by law.
Vacation Time.
 
(g)        In accordance with Company policies and procedures and on prescribed Company forms, the Company will reimburse the Executive for all proper expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder.

Renewal; Termination
 
(a)         This Agreement may be renewed upon (i) the issuance by the Company of a notice of renewal ("Notice of Renewal") to the Executive at least six (6) months prior to the end date of the Term of Employment or any renewal period thereof and (ii) the written acceptance of the Notice of Renewal by the Executive within (60) days thereafter.
Renewal. 
 
(b)       
Termination.
 
(i)    The Executive's employment under this Agreement and the Term of Employment will be terminated immediately upon the death of the Executive or upon written notice given by the Company to the Executive in the event that the Executive  has, because of any illness, injury, accident or condition
Death or Disability.
of either a physical or psychological nature, been unable to perform substantially all of the Executive's duties and responsibilities for one hundred eight (180) consecutive calendar days (a "Disability Termination"); provided, that the Executive is still "disabled" (in accordance with the definition herein) on the date such notice is given; and provided, further, however, if prior to such notice, the Executive incurs a "separation from service" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1-409A-1(h) ("Separation from Service") as a result of illness, injury, accident or condition, such date shall be the date of the Disability Termination.  In addition to the other amounts expressly provided herein, (A) in the event of the Executive's death during the Term of Employment the Company will pay to the Executive's estate an amount equal to the Base Salary for the remainder of the full Term of Employment and the amount of any benefit payable under any individual or group life insurance policy maintained by the Company for the benefit of the Executive, with such amount being paid in a lump sum sixty (60) days after the date of the Executive's death, and (B) in the event of a Disability Termination an amount equal to the difference between the Base Salary for the remainder of the full Term of Employment and the projected amount of any benefit payable under any disability insurance policy maintained by the Company for the benefit of the Executive assuming that the Executive remained disabled for the remainder of the full Term of Employment, with such amount being paid in a lump sum sixty (60) days after the date of the Disability Termination, plus (C) in the case of both (A) and (B), a pro rata bonus for the year in which such termination of employment occurs equal to the total value of the bonus (i.e. cash portion plus equity portion) paid or payable to the Executive for the year prior to the year of termination multiplied by the ratio of the number of days the Executive was employed during the year of termination divided by 365 and paid in cash at the same time such annual bonus would have been paid if the Executive continued to be employed by the Company (or if applicable, as provided under any deferred compensation plan).
(ii)    This Agreement may be terminated by the Company without cause on no less than three hundred sixty-five (365) days' advance notice by the Company or by the Executive without cause on no less than ninety (90) days', but no more than 365 days', advance notice to the Company or by the Executive for Good Reason.  The notice from either party will specify the effective date of the Executive's employment termination (the "Termination Date").  If terminated without cause by the Company or for Good Reason by the Executive, the Company will pay to the Executive all accrued but unpaid Base Salary and benefits as of the date such notice of termination is delivered (the "Notice Date").  On the Termination Date, the Company will provide the Executive with a cash payment equal to the Executive's annual Base Salary as of the Notice Date.  In addition, if this Agreement is terminated without cause by the Company or for Good Reason by the Executive, so long as the Executive continues to abide by the provisions of Sections 4(b), 4(c) and 6 herein
       Without Cause
or for Good Reason.
notwithstanding any expiration of the period specified therein, the Company will continue to pay to the Executive an amount equal to the Base Salary as and when it would be paid to its executives generally through the Termination Date.
As used herein, "Good Reason" will mean any of the following which remains uncured by the Company for twenty (20) days after the Notice Date: (a) a substantial adverse alteration in the then-current responsibilities of the Executive; (b) any material breach of this Agreement by the Company, including any purported termination of the Executive's employment which breaches this Agreement; or (c) a change by the Company in the location at which the Executive is required to perform his principal duties hereunder to offices that are not located in the Chicago or New York greater metropolitan areas.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(b)(ii), the Company may require the Executive to leave Company premises immediately on the Notice Date. Such a requirement will not relieve the Company of its obligations herein, including its obligation to continue Base Salary and benefits through the Termination Date.
 
In the event the Executive terminates this Agreement without cause or Good Reason, the Company will only be required to pay or provide to the Executive all accrued but unpaid Base Salary and benefits as of the date of such termination.
 
(iii)  The Company may at any time during the initial Term of Employment and during any renewals thereof, terminate this Agreement for "cause", effective immediately by written notice of termination given to the Executive setting forth the basis for such termination.  For the purposes of this Agreement, "cause" will mean the Executive's: (A) willful failure to substantially perform his duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from the Executive's physical or mental incapacity), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Executive that specifically identifies the manner in which the CEO believes that the Executive has willfully and not substantially performed his duties, and the Executive has failed to remedy the situation within fifteen (15) business days of such written notice from the Company; (B) gross negligence with regard to material matters in the performance of the Executive's duties; (C) willful engagement in misconduct with regard to the Company or his duties that is, or is reasonably anticipated by the Company to be, materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise; (D) deliberate, voluntary or intentional material violation of the Company's written policies and procedures, (E) willful material violation of the Aon Code of Business Conduct or the Aon Code of Ethics, (F) willful material non compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to Sections 4 and 6, which is not promptly cured after written notice (with specificity as to the noncompliance) is given to the
        For Cause.
Executive thereof, or (G) conviction of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, any felony whatsoever or any other crime involving the personal enrichment of the Executive at the expense of the Company.  No act or failure to act on the Executive's part shall be considered "willful" if conducted by the Executive in good faith and with a reasonable belief that the Executive's act or omission was in, and not opposed to, the best interests of the Company.
In the event of a termination for "cause," the Company will only be required to pay or provide to the Executive all accrued but unpaid Base Salary and benefits as of the date of such termination.
 
(iv)  As of the effective date of termination, the Executive agrees that the Secretary of the Company may, as an irrevocable proxy and in the Executive's name and stead, execute all documents and things which the Company deems necessary and desirable to effect the Executive's resignation as an officer or director of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
 
(v)  Upon the effective date of termination, or other expiration of this Agreement, the obligations of the parties under this Agreement, other than the Executive's obligations under Sections 3(c), 4, 6, and 9(e), and the Company's obligations under Sections 3(b) will cease; provided further that any other provision which contemplates performance or observance by either or both parties subsequent to any termination of this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect.
 
(vi)  Any agreement herein by the Company to continue to pay Base Salary or any other benefits after the termination of employment will be reduced by any benefits provided by the Aon Severance Plan.
 
(vii)  For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "retirement," "termination of employment," "terminated," "termination," "this Agreement will be terminated" and variations thereof, as used in this Agreement, are intended to mean a termination of employment that constitutes a "separation from service" under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code Section 409A").
 
(c)
        
The Executive agrees that, prior to the commencement of any new employment in the insurance business, the Executive will furnish the prospective new employer with a copy of this Agreement.  The Executive also agrees that the Company may advise any prospective new employer of the Executive of the existence and terms of this Agreement and furnish the prospective new employer with a copy of this Agreement.

.
Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation
 
(a)               The Executive acknowledges that in the course of his employment with the Company, and any predecessor company or affiliated company, the Executive has and will become familiar with trade secrets and other confidential information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and that the Executive's services will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its affiliates.
General.
 
(b)                The Executive agrees that during the Term of Employment  and for a period of two years beginning on the effective date of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Noncompetition Period") the Executive will not in any manner, directly or indirectly, through any person, firm or corporation, alone or as a member of a partnership or as an officer, director, stockholder, investor or employee of or consultant to any other corporation or enterprise or otherwise, engage or be engaged, or assist any other person, firm, corporation or enterprise in engaging or being engaged, in any business, in which the Executive was involved or had knowledge, being conducted by, or contemplated by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the termination of the Executive's employment in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is then conducting such business.
Noncompetition.
 
(c)  The Executive further agrees that during the Noncompetition Period the Executive will not in any manner, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate or abandon his or her employment with the Company for any purpose whatsoever.
           Nonsolicitation.
 
(d)               Nothing in this Section 4 will prohibit the Executive from being (i) a stockholder in a mutual fund or a diversified investment company or (ii) a passive owner of not more than two percent of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation, any securities of which are publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
Exceptions.
 
(e)                If, at any time of enforcement of this Section 4, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.  This Agreement will not authorize a court to increase or broaden any of the restrictions in this Section 4.
Reformation.
 
(f)  The Company and the Executive agree that the payments to be made, and the benefits to be provided, by the Company to the Executive pursuant to Section 3 hereof will be made and provided in consideration of the Executive's agreements contained in Section 4 hereof.  In the event that the Company determines that the Executive has committed a material breach of any provision of Section 4 hereof, on written
               Consideration; Breach.
notice to the Executive setting forth the basis for such determination, the Company will be entitled immediately to terminate making all remaining payments and providing all remaining benefits pursuant to Section 3 hereof and upon such termination the Company will have no further liability to the Executive under this Agreement; provided, however, that if a court of law determines that no such material breach occurred, the Company will be obligated to make such payments in a timely manner.
5.
 
.
Company's Right to Injunctive Relief
 
The Executive acknowledges that the Executive's services to the Company are of a unique character which gives them a special value to the Company, the loss of which cannot reasonably or adequately be compensated in damages in an action at law, and that a breach of Section 4 or 6 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing harm to the Company and that therefore, in addition to any other remedy which the Company may have at law or in equity, the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief for a breach of this Agreement by the Executive.
 
6.
 
.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information; Inventions
 
(a)         The Executive acknowledges that the Company's business depends to a significant degree upon the possession of information which is not generally known to others, and that the profitability of the business of the Company requires that this information remain proprietary to the Company.
Trade Secrets and Confidential Information. 
 
The Executive will not, except as required in the course of employment by the Company, disclose or use during or subsequent to the course of employment, any trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information relating to the business of the Company of which the Executive becomes aware by reason of being employed by the Company or to which the Executive gains access during his employment by the Company and which has not been publicly disclosed (other than by the Executive in breach of this provision).  Such information includes client and customer lists, data, records, computer programs, manuals, processes, methods and intangible rights which are either developed by the Executive during the course of employment or to which the Executive has access.  All records and equipment and other materials relating in any way to any confidential information relating to clients or to the business of the Company or Aon Group will be and remain the sole property of the Company during and after the end of employment.
 
Upon termination of employment, the Executive will promptly return to the Company all materials and all copies or tangible embodiments of materials involving any confidential information in the Executive's possession or control.
 
(b)        The Executive hereby assigns to the Company his or her entire right, title and interest in and to all discoveries and improvements, patentable or otherwise, trade

secrets and ideas writings and copyrightable material, which may be conceived by the Executive or developed or acquired by the Executive during the Term of Employment, which may pertain directly or indirectly to the business of the Company or any of its affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries. The Executive agrees to disclose fully all such developments to the Company upon its request, which disclosure will be made in writing promptly following any such request. The Executive will upon the Company's request, execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company all instruments and do all other acts which are necessary or desirable to enable the Company or any of its affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries to file and prosecute applications for, and to acquire, maintain and enforce, all patents, trademarks, and copyrights in all countries.
7.
   Beginning on the Effective Date and extending through the Term of Employment, the Executive will be entitled to "Tier 1" Change in Control severance protection pursuant to the Company's standard form of change-in-control agreement ("CIC Agreement") in effect at such time, which agreement does not provide for gross-up protection for excise tax incurred by the Executive under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The parties agree and acknowledge that such CIC Agreement will supersede the Change in Control Agreement entered into by the parties on September 19, 2008, and any other prior or contemporaneous agreement providing severance protection in the event of a change in control of the Company.

Change in Control Protection
 
8.  .
Mergers and Consolidations; Assignability
 
The rights and obligations under this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns.

(h)           "Termination Date" means the date during the Termination Period on which the Executive's employment is terminated other than by reason of a Nonqualifying Termination.

Obligations of the Executive
 
3.             .  If during the Termination Period the employment of the Executive shall terminate, other than by reason of a Nonqualifying Termination, and the Executive (or the Executive's executor or other legal representative in the case of the Executive's death or disability following such termination) executes a noncompetition, nonsolicitation and confidentiality agreement and release of claims substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Noncompetition Agreement and Release") within 45 days following the Termination Date, the Company shall provide to the Executive, as compensation for services rendered to the Company, and in consideration of the covenants set forth in the Noncompetition Agreement and Release, the payments and benefits described in this Section 3.  The Executive shall forfeit the payments and benefits described in this Section 3 in the event that the Executive fails to execute and deliver the Noncompetition Agreement and Release to the Company in accordance with the timing and other provisions of the preceding sentence or revokes such Noncompetition Agreement and Release prior to the date the release of claims contained therein becomes effective.

th
 day following the later to occur of the Termination Date or the Change in Control:
 
(1)           a cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) equal to the sum of (i) the Executive's full annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies through the Termination Date, to the extent not theretofore paid, (ii) the average of the Executive's annual cash incentive for each of the three fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs and the denominator of which is 365 or 366, as applicable, and (iii) any accrued vacation pay, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid; plus
(2)           a lump sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) in an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (a) Executive's annual base salary from the Company and its affiliated companies in effect on the Termination Date and (b) the average incentive compensation paid to the Executive by the Company for the previous two years; plus
 
(3)           a lump sum cash amount (subject to any applicable payroll or other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to Section 7 and any deductions authorized by the Executive) in an amount equal to the amount forfeited by the Executive under any qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a result of the Executive's termination of employment.
 
(b)           The Executive shall become fully (100%) vested in the Executive's accrued benefits under the Aon Excess Benefit Plan, the Aon Supplemental Savings Plan, or successor plans in effect on the date of the Executive's termination of employment (the "Nonqualified Plans").  The Executive's accrued benefits under the Aon Supplemental Savings Plan, as applicable to the Executive on the date of the Executive's termination of employment, shall be determined by crediting the Executive with two (2) additional years of retirement plan contributions, which for purposes of this paragraph will be calculated using the Executive's compensation for the last full calendar year ending on or prior to the date of the Executive's termination of employment.
 
(c)           For the period commencing on the Termination Date and ending on the earlier of (i) the date which is two (2) years following the Termination Date and (ii) the date on which the Executive becomes eligible to participate in and receive medical, dental and life insurance benefits under a plan or arrangement sponsored by another employer having benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits provided pursuant to this Section 3(c), the Company shall continue the Executive's medical, dental and life insurance coverage, under the Company-sponsored plans or otherwise, upon the same terms and otherwise to the same extent as such coverage shall have been in effect immediately prior to the Executive's Termination Date, and the Company and the Executive shall share the costs of the continuation of such medical, dental and life insurance coverage in the same proportion as such costs were shared immediately prior to the Termination Date; provided, that the cost of any medical insurance plan premium reimbursement paid by the Company to the Executive following the end of the continuation coverage period under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, shall be the full cost thereof; provided, further, the Company's share of the cost of the continuation of coverage under any self-insured medical reimbursement plan that is subject to Section 105(h) of the Code shall be included in the Executive's taxable income from the Company.  Such continuation of medical and dental coverage shall be in satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA).  Payment or reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Executive pursuant to this Section 3(c) shall be made promptly and in no event later than December 31 of the year following the year in which such expenses were incurred, and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, in any year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other year, except
for any limit on the amount of expenses that may be reimbursed under an arrangement described in Section 105(b) of the Code.  Additionally, such right to payment or reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.  If the Executive is a "specified employee" under Section 409A of the Code, the full cost of the continuation or provision of employee benefits described under this Section 3(c) (other than any cost of medical or dental benefit plans or programs or the cost of any other plan or program that is exempt from Section 409A of the Code) shall be paid by the Executive until the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment, and such cost shall be reimbursed by the Company or the applicable subsidiary to, or on behalf of, the Executive in a lump sum cash payment on the earlier to occur of the Executive's death or the date that is six months and one day following the Executive's termination of employment.
 
4.             .  Immediately upon the Executive's Termination Date, all stock options and other equity awards, if any, granted by the Company to the Executive (or stock options and other equity awards granted in substitution therefor by an acquiror of, or successor to, the Company) that are not otherwise exercisable or vested shall become exercisable and vested in full.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the time or schedule of any payment or amount scheduled to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Section 4, including but not limited to any restricted stock unit or other equity-based award, payment or amount that provides for the "deferral of compensation" (as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code), may not be accelerated except as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code and the guidance and Treasury regulations issued thereunder.  With respect to any and all outstanding stock options granted by the Company to the Executive, each such option shall remain exercisable following the Executive's termination of employment until and including the expiration date of the term of the option (as set forth in the written agreement relating to such option).
Vesting of Equity Awards Upon Termination Date; Exercise Period
 
5.               (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it shall be determined that (i) any payment, award, benefit or distribution (or any acceleration of any payment, award, benefit or distribution) by the Company (or any of its affiliated entities) or any entity which effectuates a Change in Control (or any of its affiliated entities) to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (the "Payments") would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), and (ii) the reduction of the amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement to the maximum amount that could be paid to the Executive without giving rise to the Excise Tax (the "Safe Harbor Cap") would provide the Executive with a greater after-tax amount than if such amounts were not reduced, then the amounts payable to the Executive under this Agreement shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Safe Harbor Cap.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made to the extent necessary in the following order: (i) the acceleration of vesting of stock options with an exercise price that exceeds the then fair market value of the stock subject to the award and of other equity awards, provided that such stock options and of other equity awards are not permitted to be valued under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 Q/A  24(c); (ii) the payments under Section 3(a); (iii) the payments and benefits under Section 3(b); (iv) the payments and benefits under Section 3(c); (v) any equity awards accelerated pursuant to Section 4 or otherwise valued
Code Section 4999 Excise Tax.
at full value, provided that such equity awards are not permitted to be valued under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 Q/A  24(c); (vi) the acceleration of vesting of stock options with an exercise price that exceeds the then fair market value of the stock subject to the award and other equity awards, provided that such stock options and other equity awards are permitted to be valued under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 Q/A  24(c); and (vii) the acceleration of vesting of all other stock options and equity awards on a basis resulting in the highest amount retained by the Executive.  For purposes of reducing the Payments to the Safe Harbor Cap, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.  If the reduction of the amounts payable hereunder would not result in a greater after-tax result to the Executive, no amounts payable under this Agreement shall be reduced pursuant to this provision.
 
(b)           All determinations required to be made under this Section shall be made by the public accounting firm that is retained by the Company as of the date immediately prior to the Change in Control (the "Accounting Firm") which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Company or the Executive that there has been a Payment, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event (i) the Board shall determine prior to the Change in Control that the Accounting Firm is precluded from performing such services under applicable auditor independence rules or (ii) the Audit Committee of the Board determines that it does not want the Accounting Firm to perform such services because of auditor independence concerns or (iii) the Accounting Firm is serving as accountant or auditor for the person(s) effecting the Change in Control, the Board shall appoint another nationally recognized public accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder (which accounting firm shall then be referred to as the Accounting Firm hereunder).  All fees, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, the costs of retaining experts) of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Company.  If payments are reduced to the Safe Harbor Cap or the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Executive without a reduction in payments, the Accounting Firm shall provide a written  opinion to the Executive to the effect that the Executive is not required to report any Excise Tax on the Executive's federal income tax return, and that the failure to report the Excise Tax, if any, on the Executive's applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition of a negligence or similar penalty.  The determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive (except as provided in Section 5(c) below).
 
(c)           If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") proceeding which has been finally and conclusively resolved, that Payments have been made to, or provided for the benefit of, the Executive by the Company which are in excess of the limitations provided in this Section (referred to hereinafter as an "Excess Payment"), the Executive shall repay the Excess Payment to the Company on demand, together with interest on the Excess Payment at the applicable federal rate (as defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) from the date of the Executive's receipt of such Excess Payment until the date of such repayment.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the determination, it is possible that Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an "Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made under this Section.  In the event that it is determined (i) by the Accounting Firm, the Company (which shall include the position taken by the Company, or together with its consolidated group, on its federal income tax return) or the IRS or (ii) pursuant
