Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 15, 2011, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Aon"), entered into a Term Credit Agreement (the "Term Loan Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ("B of A"), as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto (collectively, the "Term Loan Lenders"), Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as syndication agent ("Morgan Stanley"), Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., ("Citigroup"), Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

The net proceeds of the loans under the Term Loan Facility were used, together with the net proceeds of Aon's May 24, 2011 offering of $500 million in senior unsecured notes, to repay all amounts outstanding under Aon's $1 billion three-year term credit agreement dated as of August 13, 2010, entered into in connection with Aon's merger transaction with Hewitt Associates, Inc., which agreement was described in Item 1.01 of Aon's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2010, and which description is incorporated herein by reference (the "Prior Credit Agreement").  The Prior Credit Agreement was terminated effective June 15, 2011.
 
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will bear interest, at Aon's option, at a rate equal to either (a) the rate for eurodollar deposits as reflected on the applicable Reuters LIBOR01 page for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (adjusted for any statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities) (the "Eurodollar Rate"), plus the applicable margin or (b) the highest of (i) the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank of America, N.A., as its prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5% and (iii) the one month Eurodollar Rate plus 1.0%, in each case plus the applicable margin.  The applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan Facility may change depending on Aon's achievement of certain public debt ratings.  The Term Loan Facility has a maturity date of October 1, 2013 and contains covenants with respect to the ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (which may not be less than 4.0 to 1.0) and the ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA (which may not be more than 3.0 to 1.0), as well as other customary covenants, undertakings and events of default.
 
Aon has a number of other commercial relationships with the Term Loan Lenders, lead arrangers and co-arrangers or their affiliates.  In addition, Aon and certain of its affiliates have performed, and may perform, various insurance brokerage and consulting services for the Term Loan Lenders, lead arrangers and co-arrangers or their affiliates.

Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.06.
 
(d)        Each Lender that is not incorporated or otherwise organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "") agrees that it will, not more than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (or, in the case of a Lender who becomes a party hereto after the date of this Agreement, the date it becomes a party hereto), deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or W-8IMY (and any required attachments), certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes.  Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes, to the extent lawful at such time, to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (i) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (ii) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be required by applicable law or otherwise reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.  In addition, each Non-US Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower any documents as shall be prescribed by applicable law or otherwise reasonably requested to demonstrate that
Non-U.S. Lender
 
payments to such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are exempt from any United States federal withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA.  All forms or amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments of interest under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred after the date it became a Lender hereunder and prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments of interest without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.  For purposes of this Section 3.05(d), each change of a Lender's Lending Installation in accordance with Section 2.17 shall be treated as though such Lending Installation became a party hereto on the date of such change of Lending Installation.
 
(e)        For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form or other document pursuant to clause (d) above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form or other document originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.05 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form or other document required under clause (d), above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.
provided
 
(f)         Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
 
(g)        Each Lender that is not a Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
 
(h)        If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its
 
exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason not caused by or constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this subsection, together with all reasonable costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent).  The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.05(h) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
 
Section 3.06To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender under Sections 3.01, 3.02 and 3.05 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.03, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender.  Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.04 or 3.05.  Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.  If any Lender fails to deliver such written statement within 180 days after the date on which the Lender becomes aware of the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim, the Borrower shall have no obligation to reimburse, compensate or indemnify such Lender with respect to any such claim under this Article 3 for any period more than 180 days before the date on which such statement is delivered.  Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.  Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement.  The obligations of the Borrower under Section 3.01, 3.02, 3.04 and 3.05 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

SCHEDULE 5.21
 
As disclosed in the Borrower's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), following inquiries from regulators, Borrower commenced an internal review of its compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In January 2009, Aon Limited, Borrower's principal U.K. brokerage subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with the FSA to pay 5.25 million arising from its failure to exercise reasonable care to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to counter the risks of bribery arising from the use of overseas firms and individuals who helped it win business. The SEC and the Department of Justice ("DOJ") continue to investigate these matters. Borrower is fully cooperating with these investigations and has agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current information, Borrower is unable to predict at this time when the SEC and DOJ matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.

News from Aon
 
Aon Enters into $450 million Term Credit Agreement
 
CHICAGO, IL  June 15, 2011
- Aon Corporation (NYSE: AON) announced today its execution of a $450 million Term Credit Agreement (the "Agreement").  The loans incurred under the Agreement will mature on October 1, 2013 and will bear interest at a variable annual rate of Libor plus a margin which varies depending on the Company's public debt ratings.  As of the closing of the Agreement, the applicable interest rate is Libor plus 137.5 basis points, currently 1.56%.
 
Net proceeds of the loans under the Agreement were used, together with the net proceeds of the $500 million of our Senior Unsecured Notes issued May 24, 2011, for the complete repayment and termination of Aon's $1 billion three-year Term Credit Agreement, which was entered into in connection with the merger transaction with Hewitt Associates Inc., had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $450 million as of June 15, 2011 (after application of the proceeds from the sale of the Senior Unsecured Notes), and bore interest at a variable annual rate of Libor plus 250 basis points, currently 2.71%.
 
In the second quarter, Aon will record a non-cash charge in interest expense of approximately $19 million as a result of the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the repaid Term Credit Agreement.
 
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. acted as joint book-runners and lead arrangers with Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, RBS Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as co-arrangers under the Agreement.

property and casualty markets and commercial premium rates that could impact revenues; the outcome of inquiries from regulators and investigations related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws; the impact of investigations brought by U.S. state attorneys general, U.S. state insurance regulators, U.S. federal prosecutors, U.S. federal regulators, and regulatory authorities in the U.K. and other countries; the impact of class actions and individual lawsuits including client class actions, securities class actions, derivative actions and ERISA class actions; the cost of resolution of other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies, including potential liabilities arising from error and omissions claims against Aon; the extent to which Aon retains existing clients and attract new businesses; the extent to which Aon manages certain risks created in connection with the various services, including fiduciary and advisory services, among others, that Aon currently provides, or will provide in the future, to clients; the extent to which Aon retains existing employees and attracts new personnel; the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which Aon operates, particularly given the global scope of Aon's  businesses and the possibility of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions in which Aon does business; changes in costs or assumptions associated with our outsourcing and consulting engagements that affect the profitability of these engagements; and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits to Aon of the Benfield merger.
