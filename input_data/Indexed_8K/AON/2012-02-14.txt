(b)           On February 13, 2012 (the "Effective Date"), Baljit Dail, a named executive officer of Aon Corporation (the "Company") and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Aon Hewitt, entered into a Separation Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") providing for the termination of his employment with the Company effective March 31, 2012 (the "Separation Date").  Mr. Dail's resignation as the Co-Chief Executive Officer of Aon Hewitt, as an officer of any other affiliate of the Company, and as a member of all committees of the Company, including the executive committee, is effective as of the Effective Date and his employment with the Company will cease effective as of the Separation Date.  Mr. Dail is leaving the Company to focus on his health and work-life balance.  Aon Hewitt will continue under the leadership of current Chief Executive Officer, Kristi Savacool.
 
(e)           The Separation Agreement provides that after the Separation Date, Mr. Dail shall be eligible for vesting pursuant to the "terminations without cause" provisions under certain of the Company's stock plans and programs with respect to certain awards.  However, Mr. Dail has waived entitlement to certain other stock awards and any annual incentive payments covering performance in 2011 or 2012.
 
The Separation Agreement provides for the following additional compensation and benefits: a lump sum payment of $1,000,000, subject to applicable withholdings, on October 1, 2012 and eligibility to participate through the end of 2012 in the Company's executive physical program and COBRA continuation coverage under the Company's health programs.
 
The compensation and benefits to Mr. Dail under the Separation Agreement are subject to his executing and not revoking a release of claims.  In addition, the Separation Agreement contains certain confidentiality provisions and restrictive covenants that impose additional restrictions on Mr. Dail, including non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that apply for a period of two years beginning on the Separation Date.
 
The foregoing summaries contained in this Item 5.02 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Separation Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Restrictive Covenants
 
(a)              The Executive acknowledges that he is bound to certain restrictive covenants as set forth in the Employment Agreement and various equity-based award agreements he entered into with the Company, that during the course of his employment with the Company, and any predecessor company or affiliated company, the Executive has become familiar with trade secrets and other confidential information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries and that the Executive's services were of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its affiliates.
 
(b)          
Noncompetition.
 
(i)            The Executive agrees that for a period of two years beginning on the Executive's Separation from Service (the "Noncompetition Period") the Executive will not in any manner, directly or indirectly, through any person, firm or corporation, alone or as a member of a partnership or as an officer, director, stockholder, investor or employee of or consultant to any other corporation or enterprise or otherwise, (i) engage or be engaged, or assist any other person, firm, corporation or enterprise in engaging or being engaged, in the business of insurance brokerage, reinsurance brokerage, employee benefits brokerage or benefits and human resources consulting and administration (the "Specified Businesses") provided that such Specified Business represents, or is reasonably expected to represent, the greater of $400 million dollars or at least 55% of the business' annual gross revenue, respectively, in the fiscal year prior to the Executive becoming affiliated with such entity or in the fiscal year of such affiliation (the "Limits") or (x) provide services to (A) a Listed Major Competitor (as defined below) or a successor in interest to all or substantially all of the assets of a Listed Major Competitor or (B) any business (or an entity owning such business) which is spun-off or otherwise disposed of by a Listed Major Competitor if (I) such spun-off or otherwise disposed business is a Specified Business or would be a Specified Business if the definition of "Specified Business" included human resources business process outsourcing services and (II) the Limits are satisfied, with the Limits being calculated based only on the spun-off or otherwise disposed business.  Provided, however, that nothing in this Paragraph shall preclude the Executive from working with or on behalf of any private equity entity that has an investment interest in, or provides management, business strategy or other advice to, a Listed Major Competitor, in keeping with the private equity entity's investment interest. For purposes of clarification, nothing in this Paragraph shall exclude the Executive from being employed by a private equity entity which has an investment interest in any of the Listed Major Competitors, or from providing management, business strategy or other advice or services in connection with said investment interest. This restriction will apply in any geographic area in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is then conducting such business.
 
(ii)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing prohibition, the following businesses are the "Listed Major Competitors": Marsh & McLennan Companies,
Inc.; Willis Group Holdings Limited; Towers Watson & Co.; the Hay Group; Xerox Corporation; Fidelity Investments; Accenture plc; International Business Machines Corporation; and any entity that satisfies the criteria in the following sentence.  A Listed Major Competitor shall also include any entity that is involved in human resources business process outsourcing services (x) in which more than 50% of the voting power to elect directors is owned by private equity funds, directly or indirectly, and (y) that has indicated (by words or actions) that its intent is to become a significant competitor to the Company with respect to human resources business process outsourcing services generally.
 
(iii)          For purposes of this Section 4(b), (x) "benefits and human resources administration" means providing recordkeeping services to and for retirement plans and health and other welfare benefit plans; (y) "benefits and human resources consulting" means providing consulting or actuarial services to clients in their capacity as employers and/or sponsors of retirement plans and health and other welfare plans but shall not include management consulting services; and (z) neither payroll services nor outsourcing services (other than the aforesaid record keeping or consulting to employers and/or sponsors as to selection of vendors) shall be within the meaning of "benefits and human resources consulting and administration."
 
Furthermore, in calculating the Limits, any entity's revenues from sub-segments of a segment of a business that competes with sub-segments of a segment of the Company that represents less than 10% of the revenues of Aon Hewitt in the fiscal year prior to the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company (consolidating such revenues of the prior entities for determinations made prior to January 1, 2012) shall not be considered as revenues of the Specified Businesses.
 
(c)The Executive further agrees that during the Noncompetition Period the Executive will not in any manner, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate or abandon his employment with the Company for any purpose whatsoever.
          
 
(d)              Nothing in this Paragraph 6 will prohibit the Executive from being (i) a stockholder in a mutual fund or a diversified investment company or (ii) a passive owner of not more than two percent of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation, any securities of which are publicly traded, so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of such corporation.
 
(e)              If, at any time of enforcement of this Paragraph 8, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances will be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court will be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.  This Agreement will not authorize a court to increase or broaden any of the restrictions in this Paragraph 8.
(f)The Company and the Executive agree that the payments to be made and the benefits to be provided pursuant to this Agreement by the Company are provided in consideration of the Executive's agreements contained in this Paragraph 6 hereof.  In the event that the Company determines that the Executive has committed a material breach of any provision of Paragraph 6 hereof, on written notice to the Executive setting forth the basis for such determination, the Company will be entitled immediately to terminate making all remaining payments and providing all remaining benefits pursuant to Paragraphs 2 and 4 hereof and upon such termination the Company will have no further liability to the Executive under this Agreement; provided, however, that if a court of law determines that no such material breach occurred, the Company will be obligated to make such payments or provide such benefits in a timely manner.
             
 
(g) The Executive acknowledges that the Executive's services to the Company are of a unique character which gives them a special value to the Company, the loss of which cannot reasonably or adequately be compensated in damages in an action at law, and that a breach of Paragraph 8 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing harm to the Company and that therefore, in addition to any other remedy which the Company may have at law or in equity, the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief for a breach of this Agreement by the Executive.
 
7.             .  The Executive shall not, at any time , make use of or disclose, directly or indirectly, any (a) trade secret or other confidential or secret information of the Company or of an of its subsidiaries or (b) other technical, business proprietary or financial information of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries not available to the public generally or to the competitors of the Company or to the competitors of any of its subsidiaries, except to the extent that such Confidential Information (i) becomes a matter of public record or is published in newspaper, magazine or other periodical available to the general public, other than as a result of any act or omission of the Executive, (ii) is required to be disclosed by any law, regulation or order of any court or regulatory commission, department or agency, provided that the Executive gives prompt notice of such requirement to the company to enable the Company to seek an appropriate protective order, or (iii) is necessary to perform properly the Executive's duties under this Agreement.  Promptly following the Termination Date the Executive shall surrender to the Company all records, memoranda, notes, plans, reports, computer tapes and software and other documents and data which constitute Confidential Information on the Termination Date, which he possesses or has under his control.

8.             .  The Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company following the Termination Date by making himself reasonably available to testify on behalf of the Company in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, and to assist the Company in any such action, suit, or proceeding, including by providing information and meeting and consulting with the Company's Board of Directors or its representatives or counsel, or representatives or counsel to the Company, as reasonably requested; provided, however, that the same does not materially interfere with his then-current professional activities.  If the Executive's cooperation is required in excess of two full business days, the Company agrees to reimburse the Executive at a rate of $400 per hour for any additional time.  The Company also agrees to reimburse the Executive for all reasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with his provision of testimony or assistance.
Cooperation
9.             .  The Company agrees to continue and maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy covering the Executive during any applicable statute of limitations period, to the extent the Company provides such coverage for its other executive officers and/or members of its Board of Directors, in addition to any rights to indemnification to which the Executive is entitled to pursuant to the Bylaws, or other policies of any Aon-related corporation with which he has been employed

The Company further agrees that, in the event of a sale or transfer of assets as described in the preceding sentence, it shall cause such assignee or transferee to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company hereunder.  No rights or obligations of the Executive under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by him other than his rights to compensation and benefits, which may be transferred only by will or operation of law, and as provided in Paragraph 11(c).

The Executive further agrees to waive his rights under any other statute or regulation, state or federal, which provides that a general release does not extend to claims which the Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing this Release, which if known to him must have materially affected his settlement with the Company.

In further consideration of the promises made by the Company in this Release, the Executive specifically waives and releases the Company from all claims the Executive may have as of the date of this General Release, whether known or unknown, arising under the ADEA.  The Executive further agrees that:
 
(a)
                                 
the Executive's waiver of rights under this Release is knowing and voluntary and in compliance with the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 ("");
OWBPA
 
(b)
                                
the Executive understands the terms of this Release;
 
(c)
                                 
the Company is hereby advising the Executive in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Release;
 
(d)
                                
the Company is giving the Executive a period of twenty-one (21) days within which to consider this Release;
 
(e)
                                 
following the Executive's execution of this Release, the Executive has seven (7) days in which to revoke Executive's release under the ADEA and OWBPA by written notice.  An attempted revocation not actually received by the Company prior to the revocation deadline will not be effective;
 
(f)
                                   
the provisions of this Release with respect to ADEA and OWBPA shall be void and of no force and effect if the Executive chooses to so revoke, and if the Executive chooses not to so revoke shall become effective and enforceable upon the expiration of the revocation period; and
(g)
                                
notwithstanding Executive's revocation of the portions of this Release covering the ADEA and OWBPA, upon execution hereof all other provisions of this Release shall become effective and shall be irrevocable.
 
5.
                                      
This Release does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the Executive signs this Release.  To the extent barred by the OWBPA, the covenant not to sue contained in Paragraph 2 does not apply to claims under the ADEA that challenge the validity of this Release. The Executive specifically acknowledges that, except as specifically described above, it is his intention to release all claims known and unknown.
 
6.
                                      
To revoke the portions of this Release covering the ADEA and OWBPA, the Executive must send a written statement of revocation to the Company to the address provided in Paragraph 12 of the Agreement.  The revocation must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on the seventh (7th) day following the Executive's execution of this Release.  If the Executive does not revoke, the eighth (8th) day following the Executive's acceptance will be the "effective date" of this Release with respect to the ADEA and OWBPA provisions, in all other regards, this Release shall be effective on the date this Release is executed by the Executive.
 
7.
                                      
Executive's right to revoke is limited to the ADEA and OWBPA and shall not be construed as a right to revoke other provisions of this Release.  If Executive revokes his release of claims under the ADEA or OWBPA all remaining terms of this Release shall continue to have full force and effect and the Release shall continue to be enforceable as if the ADEA and OWBPA release was severed, but the Company shall no longer be obligated to provide the additional benefits under Paragraph 4 of the Agreement and Executive shall forfeit the vesting of any equity awards under Paragraph 2 of the Agreement.
 
8.
                                      
The Executive warrants that he has not breached his fiduciary duties to the Company, has not bound the Company to any agreement not already disclosed, and has not engaged in any conduct involving the Company that would constitute a violation of his Employment Agreement or state or federal law.  In reliance on these warranties and in consideration of the foregoing, the Company releases the Executive, his heirs, executors, personal representatives, administrators, attorneys (current and former), assigns and agents from any claims, actions, causes of action, demands, obligations or damages of any kind arising from the Executive's employment by the Company and the separation of that employment or otherwise, that the Company ever had or now has upon or by reason of any matter, cause or thing, up to and including the day on which the Company signs the Agreement.
9.
                                      
This Release shall be governed by the internal laws (and not the choice of laws) of the State of Illinois.
 
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS A RELEASE OF ALL KNOWN AND UNKNOWN CLAIMS.
