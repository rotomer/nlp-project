(b)  On March 14, 2012, in connection with the nomination process for election of directors at Aon Corporation's (the "Company") 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each of R. Eden Martin and John Rogers, Jr.,
informed the Company of his decision to retire from the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") at the end of his current term.  Accordingly, they will not stand for re-election to the Board at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  The decision by each of the retiring directors not to stand for re-election was not due to any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
