Item 5.05.  Amendment to the Registrant's Code of Ethics, or Waiver of a Provision of the Code of Ethics.
 
On May 18, 2012, the Board of Directors of Aon plc (the "Company") approved a revised Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") as part of its normal periodic review of Company policies.  The Code applies to all of the Company's directors, officers and employees, and supersedes the Company's prior Code of Business Conduct and the Company's Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers.  The revised Code updates the prior Code of Business Conduct to enhance the readability of the Code, and adds new sections on business ethics, professional behavior, social media, corporate citizenship and charitable contributions.  A copy of the Code, as revised, is located on the Company's website at www.aon.com under the Company Overview and Corporate Governance captions.
 
The amendments took effect upon adoption by the Board of Directors.
