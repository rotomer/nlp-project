ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS Exhibits are filed herewith in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-32580) filed on March 15, 2000, by Apache Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Registration Statement, amended on March 29, 2000, and declared effective by the SEC on March 30, 2000, relates to the shelf registration of certain securities including Apache common stock, par value $1.25 per share, for delayed or continuous offering pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act of an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed $1,000,000,000. Reference is made to the Registration Statement for further information concerning the terms of the common stock and other securities and the offering thereof. As described in the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated January 13, 2003, to the Prospectus dated March 30, 2000, Apache expects to issue 6,200,000 shares of its common stock to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representative for the underwriters, for offering to the public. Apache has granted to the underwriters an option to purchase up to 930,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. The Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated January 13, 2003, to the Prospectus dated March 30, 2000, is listed under Item 7 as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. On January 11, 2003, (i) a Purchase and Sale Agreement, by and between Apache Corporation and BP Exploration & Production Inc., for the sale and purchase of BP's interests in 61 producing fields, including 113 blocks, in the Gulf of Mexico, and (ii) a Sale and Purchase Agreement, by and between Apache North Sea Limited and BP Exploration Operating Company Limited, for the purchase and sale of BP's interests in two producing fields in the North Sea, were signed. The Purchase and Sale Agreement relating to the Gulf of Mexico properties is listed under Item 7 as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Sale and Purchase Agreement relating to the North Sea properties is listed under Item 7 as Exhibit 2.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. Apache Corporation also signed a Deed of Guaranty and Indemnity, dated January 11, 2003, in favor of BP Exploration Operating Company Limited relating to the acquisition of the North Sea properties, which is listed under Item 7 as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The BP transactions have received all necessary corporate approvals by Apache and BP and are not conditioned upon financing, but are subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and, in the case of the North Sea properties, U.K. regulatory and other approvals. Both agreements will be effective as of January 1, 2003, with the purchase of the Gulf of Mexico properties scheduled to close late in the first quarter of 2003 and the purchase of the North Sea properties scheduled to close late in the second quarter of 2003. Apache expects to complete the transactions as scheduled. However, there can be no assurance that the transactions will be completed as expected until both are actually consummated. 1
The total purchase price for all of the properties being acquired is $1,300,000,000, with $670,000,000 being allocated to the Gulf of Mexico properties and the remaining $630,000,000 being allocated to the properties in the North Sea. The actual purchase price payable upon the closing of each purchase will be reduced by the net cash flow from the properties, and increased by interest on the purchase price, from January 1, 2003, until the date of closing. The purchase price is also subject to customary closing adjustments. Owners of working interests in certain Gulf of Mexico properties have preferential purchase rights which, if exercised, would reduce the interests Apache purchases in those properties and the purchase price Apache would pay. Neither acquisition is conditioned upon consummation of the other acquisition. Within 15 days of the closing of each transaction, Apache will file a current report under Item 2 of Form 8-K and within 60 days after such filing, if required, the financial statements and pro forma financial information under Item 7 of Form 8-K.

ARTICLE 3. PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS 3.1 Preferential Rights To Purchase. Seller shall use Buyer's Allocations to provide any required preferential right to purchase notifications as promptly as practicable after Buyer has furnished Buyer's Allocations, based on the form of Preferential Purchase Right Notice Letter attached hereto as Exhibit "L". If, prior to the Closing Date, a holder of a preferential purchase right notifies Seller that it elects to exercise its rights with respect to the Properties to which its preferential purchase right applies (determined by and in accordance with the agreement in which the preferential purchase right arises), the Properties covered by that preferential purchase right will not be sold to the Party originally executing this Agreement as "Buyer" (subject to the remaining provisions in this Article), and the Purchase Price will be reduced by Buyer's Allocations for such Properties if Buyer's Allocations are positive numbers and increased by Buyer's Allocations for such Properties if Buyer's Allocations are negative numbers. Buyer remains obligated to purchase the remainder of the Properties not affected by exercised preferential rights to purchase. If for any reason, other than Seller's breach, the purchase 13
and sale of the Properties covered by the preferential purchase right is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of the preferential purchase right, Seller shall so notify Buyer promptly, but no later than thirty (30) Days after the date set forth in Article 17.1.4, and within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Seller such Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the value allocated to such Properties in Buyer's Allocations (except "CLOSING DATE" with respect to such Properties shall mean the date of assignment of such Properties from Seller to Buyer).

TITLE REVIEW 4.1 Review of Title Records. After execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller shall make available (during Seller's regular business hours and at their current location) for Buyer's review, Records in Seller's possession or under Seller's control relating to title to the Properties. If Buyer requests copies of title Records, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyer's expense. Such review of Records will be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 4.2 Alleged Title Defects. (a) Should Seller's Disposition Team discover a Title Defect on or before Closing, Seller shall as soon as practicable, but in any event prior to Closing, deliver to Buyer a notice including a specific description of the Title Defect and the Real Properties affected. As soon as reasonably practicable (and on an ongoing basis), but no later than fifteen (15) Days prior to Closing, Buyer may notify Seller in writing of any Alleged Title Defects. Buyer's notice asserting Alleged Title Defects must include a reasonably detailed description and explanation (including any available supporting documentation) of each Alleged Title Defect claimed, the Real Properties affected, and the value Buyer in good faith attributes to the Alleged Title Defect. Buyer and Seller shall meet from time-to-time to attempt to agree on resolution with respect to Alleged Title Defects. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove on or before the Closing Date any Alleged Title Defects with respect to the Real Properties. If prior to Closing, Seller has commenced to cure the Alleged Title Defect in a timely manner and pursues such cure diligently, then Seller may, by notice to Buyer prior to Closing, elect to continue diligently attempting to cure such defect to completion for up to one hundred eighty (180) Days following Closing. (b) Should Buyer's Acquisition Team discover any Title Benefit on or before Closing, Buyer shall as soon as practicable, but in any case prior to Closing, deliver to Seller a notice including a specific description of the Title Benefit and the Real Properties affected. Seller shall have the right to deliver to Buyer a similar notice on or before Closing with respect to each Title Benefit discovered 14
by Seller, which in the case of Seller, shall include the value Seller in good faith attributes to the Title Benefit. (c) A Purchase Price adjustment shall be made under Article 2.2(k) by reducing the Purchase Price by the net aggregate value of all actual Alleged Title Defects timely reported under this Article (or of which Seller had knowledge and should have reported under Article 4.2(a)) and not timely cured as permitted under this Article, and increasing the Purchase Price by the net aggregate value of all actual Title Benefits timely reported under this Article (or of which Buyer had knowledge and should have reported under Article 4.2(b)), subject to the other terms of this Article. The value attributable to the uncured Alleged Title Defects shall be determined as follows: (i) Where Seller agrees in writing with the value of the Alleged Title Defect as set forth in Buyer's notice, that value shall be the value of the Alleged Title Defect. (ii) If the Alleged Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge upon a Real Property which is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the value of the Alleged Title Defect shall be the amount necessary to be paid to the obligee to remove the Alleged Title Defect from the affected Real Property. (iii) If the Buyer's Allocation for any Real Property is positive and the Alleged Title Defect represents a discrepancy between the Net Revenue Interest for such Real Property and the Net Revenue Interest for that Real Property stated on Exhibit "A", then the value of such Alleged Title Defect shall be the product of the Buyer's Allocation for such Real Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the decrease in Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit "A". (iv) If the Alleged Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the affected Real Property of a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the value of the Alleged Title Defect shall be determined by taking into account Buyer's Allocation for the Real Property so affected, the portion of the Real Property affected by the Alleged Title Defect, the legal effect of the Alleged Title Defect, the potential economic effect of the Alleged Title Defect over the life of the affected Real Property, and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation. Where the affected Real Property is an easement, right-of-way, servitude or subsurface lease that is not given a separate Buyer's Allocation, that easement, right-of-way, servitude or subsurface lease shall be considered a part of the Real Property or Real Properties to which it is appurtenant for purposes of taking into account Buyer's Allocation. 15
The Parties agree for all purposes of this Article 4 that Buyer's Allocation for each Real Property is the value of that Real Property if it has the Net Revenue Interest and Working Interest stated on Exhibit "A" and is free of liens, claims and encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. The value of any Alleged Title Defect or Title Benefit consisting of a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest and/or Working Interest shall be determined solely by starting with the Buyer's Allocation and calculating the effect of the percentage change in Net Revenue Interest and/or Working Interest. Such calculation shall be based on the same assumptions with respect to production rate, production profile, price, and amounts of future capital expenditures as were used in the calculation of Buyer's Allocation, which assumptions shall be disclosed to Seller and any applicable arbitrator. Furthermore, if an Alleged Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the adjustments or payments with respect to that Alleged Title Defect shall not exceed the reasonable costs of cure. (d) If prior to Closing, the Parties are unable to agree on a resolution associated with any Alleged Title Defects raised by Buyer (or of which Seller had knowledge and should have reported under Article 4.2(a)), the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being reduced by Seller's estimate of the value of all uncured Alleged Title Defects, in accordance with Article 4.2(c), excluding those Alleged Title Defects with respect to which Seller has provided notice of its election to continue curing under Article 4.2(a); provided, however, that within thirty (30) Days after the Closing Date, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. If prior to Closing, the Parties are unable to agree on a resolution associated with any Title Benefit raised pursuant to Article 4.2(b) (or of which Buyer had knowledge and should have reported under Article 4.2(b)), the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being increased by Seller's estimate of the increase in the value of the Properties above that shown in Buyer's Allocations (including any reduction in the negative value of any Property with a negative Buyer's Allocation) as a consequence of the Title Benefit, subject to the right of either Party to initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. (e) If by one hundred eighty (180) Days following Closing, Seller has failed to cure any Alleged Title Defects with respect to which Seller has provided notice of its election to continue curing under Article 4.2(a), and the Parties have been unable by such date to agree upon a resolution associated with such Alleged Title Defects, then Seller shall make a payment to Buyer equal to Seller's estimate of the value of such uncured Alleged Title Defects, in accordance with Article 4.2(c). Within thirty (30) Days after the one hundred eighty (180) Day cure period has expired, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. (f) ANY CLAIM FOR PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED TITLE DEFECT, AND ANY ASSERTION THAT ANY ALLEGED TITLE DEFECT FOR WHICH SELLER HAS PROVIDED NOTICE OF ITS INTENT TO CURE HAS NOT BEEN CURED, THAT ARE NOT RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT OF 16
THE PARTIES OR REFERRED TO ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FOLLOWING CLOSING (OR, IN THE EVENT SELLER PROVIDES NOTICE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ATTEMPTING TO CURE THE ALLEGED TITLE DEFECT AFTER CLOSING, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) DAY CURE PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING HAS EXPIRED) SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED, UNLESS THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD IS EXTENDED BY MUTUAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. (g) Any limitations contained in the definition of Alleged Title Defect or in this Article 4.2 on Buyer's right to compensation with respect to any Title Defect shall have no effect on Buyer's right to compensation, if any, with respect to any Claim for damages or other matter (except title) involving the Real Property subject to the Title Defect under any other provision of this Agreement. (h) Seller's election to attempt to cure an Alleged Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the Alleged Title Defect. Buyer's acceptance of any payment or adjustment based on Seller's estimate of the value of an uncured Alleged Title Defect shall not constitute a waiver of Buyer's right to dispute such estimate by initiating arbitration within the time permitted by this Article. 4.3 Waiver. EXCEPT FOR THE SPECIAL WARRANTY OF TITLE GIVEN BY SELLER IN ARTICLE 10.1.6, BUYER WAIVES FOR ALL PURPOSES ALL OBJECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING ALLEGED TITLE DEFECTS), UNLESS RAISED BY PROPER NOTICE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 4.2; AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME. ARTICLE 5. INSPECTION OF PREMISES 5.1 Inspection of Premises. After execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer access (during Seller's regular business hours) to Seller-operated Properties, and Seller will use reasonable efforts to obtain permission for Buyer to gain access to third party-operated Properties, to inspect the condition of the same. Such inspection shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and subject to any boarding agreements or releases or other agreements required by the operator of the Properties and the rules and regulations of such operator with respect to health, safety and the environment. Buyer may not operate equipment during such inspection. At Buyer's reasonable request, Seller shall conduct tests for sustained casing pressure on wells included in the Properties and any other equipment tests that Seller's on-site personnel deem reasonably acceptable in connection with Buyer's site visits. Buyer may not conduct testing or sampling of materials during such inspection without Seller's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and Seller shall use good faith efforts, considering the circumstances, to respond to Buyer's requests made while on-site on a Property prior to Buyer's departure from the Property). Seller shall arrange, at Buyer's cost, for any transportation to and from any such Properties as is reasonably requested by Buyer. BUYER TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD 17

As promptly as practicable, and taking into account to the extent practicable any priorities of which Buyer has provided notice, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after execution and delivery of this Agreement, Seller shall make available (during Seller's regular business hours and at their current location) for Buyer's review, Records in Seller's possession or under Seller's control relating to the Properties. If Buyer requests copies of Records, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to provide the requested copies to Buyer at Buyer's expense. Such review of Records will be conducted in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 5.2 Alleged Adverse Conditions. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable (and on an ongoing basis), but no later than fifteen (15) Days prior to Closing, Buyer may notify Seller in writing of any Alleged Adverse Conditions. Buyer's notice asserting Alleged Adverse Conditions must include a reasonably detailed description and explanation (including any available supporting documentation) of each Alleged Adverse Condition claimed, the Properties affected, and the value Buyer in good faith attributes to the Alleged Adverse Condition. Buyer and Seller shall meet from time-to-time to attempt to agree on resolution with respect to Alleged Adverse Conditions. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure or remove on or before the Closing Date any Alleged Adverse Conditions with respect to the Properties. If prior to Closing, Seller has commenced to cure the Alleged Adverse Condition in a timely manner and pursues such cure diligently, then Seller may, by notice to Buyer prior to Closing, elect to continue diligently attempting to cure such condition to completion for up to one hundred eighty (180) Days following Closing. (b) A Purchase Price adjustment shall be made under Article 2.2(l) by reducing the Purchase Price by the net aggregate value of all actual Alleged Adverse Conditions timely reported under this Article and not timely cured as permitted 18
under this Article, subject to Article 5.2(g) and the other terms of this Article. When calculating the value of any Alleged Adverse Conditions, if an Alleged Adverse Condition is reasonably susceptible of being cured, the adjustments or payments with respect to that Alleged Adverse Condition shall not exceed the reasonable costs of cure. (c) Notwithstanding the other terms of this Article 5.2, Seller may elect by notice to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to exclude from this Agreement any Real Property and associated personal Property affected by an Alleged Adverse Condition of which Buyer has provided timely notice if (i) the Real Property has a positive Buyer's Allocation and the cumulative adjustments and payments associated with the effects of Alleged Adverse Conditions on such Real Property and associated personal Property would exceed Buyer's Allocation for such Real Property or (ii) the Real Property has a negative Buyer's Allocation. In the event any Property is excluded from this Agreement pursuant to this Article, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by Buyer's Allocation for such Property, and no other adjustment shall be made with respect to such Property. (d) If prior to Closing, the Parties are unable to agree on a resolution associated with any Alleged Adverse Conditions raised by Buyer, the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being reduced by Seller's estimate of the value of all uncured Alleged Adverse Conditions, excluding those Alleged Adverse Conditions with respect to which Seller has provided notice of its election to continue curing under Article 5.2(a); provided, however, that within thirty (30) Days after the Closing Date, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. (e) If by one hundred eighty (180) Days following Closing, Seller has failed to cure any Alleged Adverse Conditions with respect to which Seller has provided notice of its election to continue curing under Article 5.2(a), and the Parties have been unable by such date to agree upon a resolution associated with such Alleged Adverse Conditions, Seller shall make a payment to Buyer equal to Seller's estimate of the value of such uncured Alleged Adverse Conditions. Within thirty (30) Days after the one hundred eighty (180) Day cure period has expired, either Party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions set forth in Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. (f) ANY CLAIM FOR PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITION, AND ANY ASSERTION THAT ANY ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITION FOR WHICH SELLER HAS PROVIDED NOTICE OF ITS INTENT TO CURE HAS NOT BEEN CURED, THAT ARE NOT RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES OR REFERRED TO ARBITRATION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FOLLOWING CLOSING (OR, IN THE EVENT SELLER PROVIDES NOTICE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE ATTEMPTING TO CURE THE ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITIONS AFTER CLOSING, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) DAY CURE PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING HAS EXPIRED) SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED, UNLESS THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD IS EXTENDED BY MUTUAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. 19
(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be entitled to an adjustment or other remedy under Articles 5.2, 8.3 or 8.4 unless the aggregate value (determined in accordance with those Articles) of all Alleged Adverse Conditions, Non-Environmental Claims and Environmental Claims timely reported under those Articles and not cured by Seller exceeds seventeen million five hundred thousand United States dollars (US $17,500,000), and then only to the extent such aggregate value exceeds seventeen million five hundred thousand United States dollars (US $17,500,000), and as between Buyer and Seller Group, Buyer shall be solely responsible for and bear all costs and expenses associated with any and all Alleged Adverse Conditions, Non-Environmental Claims and Environmental Claims up to seventeen million five hundred thousand United States dollars (US $17,500,000). (h) Seller's election to attempt to cure an Alleged Adverse Condition shall not constitute a waiver of Seller's right to dispute the existence, nature, or value of, or cost to cure, the Alleged Adverse Condition. Buyer's acceptance of any payment or adjustment based on Seller's estimate of the value of an uncured Alleged Adverse Condition shall not constitute a waiver of Buyer's right to dispute such estimate by initiating arbitration within the time period permitted by this Article. 5.3 Waiver. BUYER WAIVES FOR ALL PURPOSES ALL OBJECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PHYSICAL AND OTHER CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES (INCLUDING ALLEGED ADVERSE CONDITIONS), UNLESS RAISED BY PROPER NOTICE WITHIN THE APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 5.2; AND BUYER (ON BEHALF OF BUYER GROUP AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT CLAIMS UNDER SELLER'S INDEMNITIES PURSUANT TO ARTICLES 8.2, 8.3 AND 8.4, THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER GROUP ASSOCIATED WITH THE SAME. ARTICLE 6. ACCOUNTING 6.1 Products. Seller (or operator of the Properties) shall gauge all merchantable oil and liquid hydrocarbon substances associated with the Properties and stored in tanks and vessels to the bottom of the flange, as of the Effective Time. Buyer shall purchase from Seller, at Closing, all such oil and liquid hydrocarbon substances at a price equal to the average price received by Seller from sales during the month of December 2002 of comparable oil and liquid hydrocarbon substances from each field from which such substances were produced, net of royalties, excise, severance and other production taxes, and marketing costs (which include for purposes hereof, among other things, costs of gathering, treating, processing, compression, and transportation), to the extent such items are not treated as "Charges" under this Article 6.

Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement. 6.2 Revenues, Expenses and Capital Expenditures.

Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement, unless previously accounted for under the Transition Agreement. Whether Charges and Operating Revenues with respect to the Properties are attributable to periods before or after the Effective Time shall be determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board) and Council of Petroleum Accountants Societies (COPAS) standards, based on the accrual method of accounting. 6.3 Taxes. Seller (or, if applicable, BP America) shall bear all taxes and assessments, including excise taxes, severance or other production taxes, ad valorem taxes and any other federal, state or local taxes or assessments attributable to ownership or operation of the Properties prior to the Effective Time; and all deductions, credits or refunds pertaining to the aforementioned taxes and assessments, no matter when received, belong to Seller (or BP America). Buyer shall bear all taxes and assessments, including sales taxes, excise taxes, severance or other production taxes, ad valorem taxes and any other federal, state or local taxes and assessments attributable to ownership or operation of the Properties on and after the Effective Time (excluding Seller's and BP America's income taxes from the Effective Time through Closing); and all deductions, credits and refunds pertaining to the aforementioned taxes and assessments, no matter when received, belong to Buyer. Ad valorem or property or other taxes based on revenue from the Properties shall apply to the tax year for which the tax rendition is issued and be prorated based on the percentage of the assessment period occurring before and after the Effective Time. Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement. Buyer shall bear all Sales Tax, if any, on the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

Actual amounts shall be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement. 6.5 Miscellaneous Accounting. Unless previously accounted for under the Transition Agreement, in addition to the items set forth in Articles 6.1 through 6.4, any other amounts due between Buyer and Seller associated with ownership or operation of the Properties from the Effective Time through the end of the Transition Period will be accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement. 21
6.6 Final Accounting Settlement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than one hundred eighty (180) Days after the end of the Transition Period, Seller shall deliver the Final Accounting Statement to Buyer. As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty (60) Days after Buyer receives the Final Accounting Statement, Buyer may deliver to Seller a written report containing any changes Buyer proposes to such statement. Any matters covered by the Final Accounting Statement as delivered by Seller to which Buyer fails to object in the written report shall be deemed correct and is final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further review, audit or arbitration. As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than forty-five (45) Days after Seller receives Buyer's written report, the Parties shall meet to attempt to agree on any adjustments to the Final Accounting Statement. If the Parties fail to agree on final adjustments within that forty-five (45) Day period, either Party may submit the disputed items to the Accounting Referee no later than the thirtieth (30th) Day following the expiration of such forty-five (45) Day period. ANY ADJUSTMENT DISPUTE THAT IS NOT RESOLVED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES OR SUBMITTED TO THE ACCOUNTING REFEREE BY SUCH THIRTIETH (30TH) DAY SHALL BE DEEMED WAIVED UNLESS THE THIRTY (30) DAY PERIOD IS EXTENDED BY MUTUAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. The Parties shall direct the Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within thirty (30) Days after its receipt of relevant materials pertaining to the dispute. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the Accounting Referee's fees and expenses. The Final Accounting Statement, whether as agreed between the Parties or as determined by a decision of the Accounting Referee, shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the earlier of (i) the date the amounts are agreed by the Parties and (ii) the date the Parties receive the Accounting Referee's decision (A) Buyer shall pay to Seller (on behalf of itself and BP America) the amount by which the Adjusted Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment, or (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the Adjusted Purchase Price, as applicable. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Article 6.6 shall bear Computed Interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment. The revenues and expenses included in the Final Accounting Settlement shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to further review, audit or arbitration. 6.7 Post-Final Accounting Settlement Revenues.

(a) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for any and all Charges paid by Buyer (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Accounting 22
Settlement or under the Transition Agreement) attributable to the Properties prior to the Effective Time, and (b) Buyer shall reimburse Seller (on behalf of itself and BP America) for any and all Charges paid by Seller (or BP America) (to the extent not accounted for in the Final Accounting Settlement or under the Transition Agreement) attributable to the Properties on and after the Effective Time. The Party responsible for the payment of such Charges shall make full payment to the other Party within sixty (60) Days after receipt of an applicable invoice and proof that such invoice was paid. Seller or BP America, as applicable, shall be entitled to resolve all joint interest audits or other audits of such costs for periods for which Seller or BP America is responsible, and neither Party shall agree to settle any audit with respect to periods for which the other is in part responsible without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. ARTICLE 7. LOSS, CASUALTY AND CONDEMNATION 7.1 Notice of Loss. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of all instances of Casualty Loss that occur and become known to Seller between the date of this Agreement and Closing. 7.2 Casualty Loss. If, prior to Closing, a portion of the Properties is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty Loss, Seller and Buyer shall meet to attempt to agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the "reduction in value" of the Properties because of such Casualty Loss. For this purpose, "reduction in value" is based on the principle that Seller should generally bear the costs of repairing the Properties to the state existing immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, but if such repair results in equipment or facilities that are newer than or upgraded from that which existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, Buyer should bear a portion of such costs that is equitable under the circumstances because of the benefit to Buyer of such newer or upgraded equipment or facilities. Except as to those Real Properties with a negative Buyer's Allocation, no adjustment associated with a Casualty Loss shall exceed Buyer's Allocation for the affected Property. For those Real Properties with a negative Buyer's Allocation, Buyer may give Seller written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing and exclude from this Agreement the Real Property subject to the Casualty Loss and increase the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Buyer's Allocation for such Real Property. If the Parties are unable to agree on resolution of a Casualty Loss, the Parties shall Close with the Purchase Price being reduced by Seller's estimate of the reduction in the value of the Properties as a result of the Casualty Loss; provided, however, either Party may, within sixty (60) Days after the Closing Date (but not later), initiate binding arbitration in accordance with Article 18.1 to resolve the dispute. Any claim for a Casualty Loss not referred to arbitration within sixty (60) Days after Closing shall be deemed waived. Notwithstanding the preceding, if a platform is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty Loss, Buyer may elect by notice to Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to exclude from this Agreement the Real Properties on which wells served by such platform are located and other related Properties and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by Buyer's Allocations for such Real Properties, and no other adjustment shall be made with respect to such platform and other Properties. Seller shall retain any and all insurance proceeds and other payments associated with or attributable to any pre-Closing Casualty Loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate Casualty Losses and 23
Property exclusions under this Article exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Purchase Price, either Party may, by notice to the other at least one Business Day prior to Closing, elect to terminate this Agreement under Article 17.1.5. ARTICLE 8. ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND INDEMNITIES 8.1 OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW. EACH PARTY REPRESENTS THAT IT HAS HAD AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW ALL RELEASE, INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT THE SAME TO LEGAL COUNSEL FOR REVIEW AND ADVICE.

AS BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER GROUP, BUYER ASSUMES AND IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS NOT SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER AT THE TIME IN QUESTION UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ARTICLE. 8.4 SELLER'S ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY OBLIGATION.

BUYER RELEASES SELLER GROUP FROM AND SHALL PROTECT, DEFEND, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SELLER GROUP HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES OR ANY PART THEREOF PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME (NO MATTER WHEN ASSERTED) FOR WHICH SELLER'S INDEMNITY AND DEFENSE OBLIGATION IN ARTICLE 8.3 HAS CEASED, TERMINATED (IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 8.3 OR OTHERWISE) OR DOES NOT APPLY, AS WELL AS FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING AGAINST SELLER GROUP FROM BUYER'S ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 3, AND FROM AND AGAINST ALL NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS RELATING TO, ARISING 25
OUT OF, OR CONNECTED WITH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OWNERSHIP OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTIES OR ANY PART THEREOF ON AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME (NO MATTER WHEN ASSERTED), INCLUDING IN EACH CASE NON-ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS RELATING TO (A) INJURY OR DEATH OF ANY PERSON WHOMSOEVER, (B) DAMAGES TO OR LOSS OF ANY PROPERTY OR RESOURCES, (C) BREACH OF CONTRACT, (D) PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES, (E) COMMON LAW CAUSES OF ACTION SUCH AS NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, NUISANCE OR TRESPASS, OR (F) FAULT IMPOSED BY LAW OR OTHERWISE.

If a Claim is asserted against a Party for which the other Party may have an obligation of indemnity and defense or may be entitled to indemnity or defense (whether under this Article 8 or any other provision of this Agreement), the Party against whom the Claim is asserted shall give the other Party prompt written notice of the Claim, setting forth the particulars associated with the Claim (including a copy of the written Claim, if any) as then known by the Indemnified Party. In the event that the Party sending the notice is seeking indemnification under this Agreement, it shall include that request in its notice (a "CLAIM NOTICE"). Any Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this Agreement shall be referred to herein as the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and the Party from whom the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification shall be referred to herein as the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY." The failure of any Indemnified Party to give prompt notice of a Claim as required by this Article shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend against the Claim. 8.8 Defense of Claims. Within thirty (30) Days after the Indemnifying Party receives a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party will assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) Day period, to file any motion, pleading or other answer that it deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interests, or those of the Indemnifying Party, and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility for 26
defense and payment of the Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Claim as it deems appropriate without relieving the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligations the Indemnifying Party may have with respect to such Claim. The Indemnifying Party's failure to respond in writing to a Claim Notice within the thirty (30) Day period shall be deemed an election by the Indemnifying Party not to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume responsibility for defense and payment of the Claim: (a) the Indemnifying Party shall defend the Indemnified Party against the Claim with counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice (reasonably acceptable to Indemnified Party which shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in all reasonable respects in such defense), (b) the Indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect to such Claim, (c) the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Claim that (i) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to the Claim or (ii) contains terms that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity), and (d) if the Indemnified Party consents to entry of any judgment or enters into any settlement with respect to the Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent, then the Indemnified Party shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any right to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Claim. In all instances the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel and participate in defense of a Claim, but the Indemnified Party shall bear all fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party. 8.9 No Duplication of Remedies. In no event shall either Party be entitled to duplicate compensation with respect to any Claim or breach of representation, warranty or agreement asserted under the terms of this Agreement, even though such Claim or breach may be addressed by more than one provision of this Agreement. Non-Environmental Claims and Environmental Claims are excluded from Charges, which are adjusted between the Parties in accordance with the terms of Article 6. Payments for Claims under Article 8 shall not effect allocations of Charges and Operating Revenues under Article 6 and allocations of Charges and Operating Revenues under Article 6 shall not effect payments for Claims under Article 8. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer's claims for indemnification under this Agreement are limited to Seller's ownership interest in the asset giving rise to such a claim. 8.10 Other Contracts Between the Parties. The releases in this Article 8 are not intended to waive any existing contractual rights between any member of Seller Group and any member of Buyer Group under operating agreements, unit agreements, service contracts or other agreements not entered into and delivered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder. 8.11 WAIVER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO SEEK INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH HEREOF. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THIS ARTICLE 8.11 DOES NOT DIMINISH OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PARTIES' RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS TO BE INDEMNIFIED AGAINST, AND PROVIDE INDEMNITY 27
FOR, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AWARDED TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR WHICH INDEMNIFICATION IS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR SELLER'S RIGHT TO RECEIVE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, INCLUDING THE PERFORMANCE DEPOSIT, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF ARTICLE 17.2.

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall execute and deliver to Seller recordable instruments, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer, granting Seller (and, if requested by Seller, Seller's Affiliates) certain non-exclusive rights-of-way on, over and through the Properties and certain rights to use facilities (including pipeline usage rights, production handling arrangements, and other reasonable rights to use improvements) as appropriate for Seller and its Affiliates to continue to conduct operations on, over and across such Properties, as specified on Schedule 12.2, in connection with properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates at Closing and not being conveyed from Seller to Buyer in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that where an existing Contract governs such use, the terms of such Contract shall continue to govern such use following Closing. (b) At Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer recordable instruments, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer, granting Buyer certain non-exclusive rights-of-way on, over and through properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates as of Closing other than the Properties and certain rights to use facilities (including pipeline usage rights, production handling arrangements, and other reasonable rights to use improvements), to the extent appropriate for Buyer to continue to operate the Properties in the manner in which they were being operated at the Effective Time, as specified in Schedule 12.2, provided that where an existing Contract governs such use, the terms of such Contract shall continue to govern such use following Closing. (c) Articles 12.2(a) and 12.2(b) are not intended to apply to facilities of a regional nature not associated with any particular field or field area (e.g. oil spill facilities, fire training facilities, shorebases, communications systems, etc.). 32
(d) Provided that Buyer acquires Properties covering twenty (20) or more OCS blocks, Buyer shall be provided with certain mutually agreed rights to the shared use of certain of Seller's retained communication equipment to the extent appropriate for Buyer to continue to operate the Properties in the manner in which they were being operated at the Effective Time, as specified in Schedule 12.2. (e) Seller shall be provided with certain mutually agreed rights to the shared use of certain of Buyer's communication equipment transferred as part of the Properties to the extent appropriate for Seller to continue to operate properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates at Closing in the manner in which they were being operated at the Effective Time, as specified in Schedule 12.2. (f) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to offer rights of use under Article 12.2(a), 12.2(b), 12.2(d) or 12.2(e) above, as applicable, if such use would materially impair that Party's ability to operate the Properties, or Seller's and its Affiliates' other properties, as applicable, in the manner they were being operated at the Effective Time or make it uneconomic to do so. (g) It is the intent of the Parties that the arrangements described in Articles 12.2(a), 12.2(b), 12.2(d) and 12.2(e) above be on a cost-sharing basis with neither Seller nor Buyer making a profit or suffering a loss as a result of such arrangements. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Party to whom a benefit is assigned or with whom a benefit is shared shall, where provided under the terms of the applicable agreement, pay its pro rata share, based on usage, of required payments to Third Parties for the use of the shared facilities. If either Party proposes to sell or abandon its interest in the shared improvements separately from its rights in the lease on which the facility is located, it is the intent of the Parties that the other Party shall have, in the case of a sale, a preferential right of purchase or, in the case of abandonment, the right to acquire the interest to be abandoned at a price equal to the estimated cost of abandonment less any salvage value, each of the foregoing subject to any applicable rights of Third Parties. 12.3 Buyer's Assumption of Obligations.

The Properties may currently or have in the past contained asbestos and NORM, and special procedures associated with assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of asbestos and NORM may be necessary. It is the Parties' intent that Seller shall not be liable for and Buyer shall have no claim against Seller for the mere existence of asbestos or NORM on the Properties (except to the extent 33
the asbestos or NORM is as of the date of execution of this Agreement in a condition that violates applicable Environmental Laws and Buyer would be entitled to a remedy with respect to such violation under another term of this Agreement) or Buyer's actions such as removal or remediation thereof.

(d) During the Interim Period, Seller shall use (and, with respect to the BP America Properties, Seller shall cause BP America to use) its reasonable efforts to obtain all required consents and approvals, and all waivers of preferential purchase rights, applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that Seller (and BP America) shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain the required consents, approvals and waivers.

This Agreement may be terminated (except for the individual provisions specifically referenced in Article 17.2 below) at any time prior to Closing (unless another date is stated below): 17.1.1 by the Parties' mutual written agreement; 17.1.2 by either Party, if consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement would violate any non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any state or federal court or agency enjoining, restraining, prohibiting or awarding substantial damages in connection with (a) the proposed sale of Properties to Buyer hereunder, or (b) consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement; 17.1.3 by Seller, if Buyer refuses or fails for any reason to deliver to Seller the Performance Deposit in accordance with Article 2.3; 17.1.4 notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, by either Seller or Buyer, if Closing has not occurred on or before June 1, 2003 provided the terminating party is not then in breach in any material respect of its obligations under Articles 12, 13 and 16; or 17.1.5 by either Seller or Buyer pursuant to Article 7.2. 17.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 17.1, such termination is without liability to either Party, except performance of obligations in this Article 17.2 and Articles 14.2, 17.3, 17.4, 19.1, 19.3, 19.10, 19.11, 19.12, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15 (all of which provisions survive termination of this Agreement), and except as provided in the following sentence. If Closing does not occur, Seller shall refund the Performance Deposit together with Computed Interest to Buyer unless the Closing did not occur because of a failure of Buyer's representations and warranties in this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects, Buyer's material breach of a material obligation, covenant or condition of this Agreement, Buyer's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence pursuant to Section 15.1.3, or Buyer's failure or refusal to Close that is not permitted by the terms of this Agreement, in any of which events Buyer shall pay to Seller as Seller's exclusive remedy an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price, less the Performance Deposit, which Seller shall be entitled to retain together with any interest earned thereon as liquidated damages and not a penalty. 17.3 Dispute over Right to Terminate. If there is a dispute between the Parties over the termination of or over the right of a Party to terminate this Agreement, Closing shall not 49
occur on the Closing Date, and the Party that disputes the right of the other Party to terminate is entitled, within thirty (30) Days after the date on which notice of termination was provided by either Party to the other, to initiate litigation to resolve the dispute, unless the Parties mutually agree in writing to extend such time. If the Party that disputes the other Party's right to terminate this Agreement does not initiate litigation within the thirty (30) Day period (as extended in writing, if applicable), this Agreement shall be deemed properly terminated as of the original date of termination (without prejudice to Seller's right to receive liquidated damages, including retention of the Performance Deposit together with any interest earned thereon, pursuant to Article 17.2), AND THE PARTY THAT DISPUTES OR HAS A RIGHT TO DISPUTE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OF ITSELF AND ITS AFFILIATES, IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IT AND THEY MAY HAVE AGAINST THE TERMINATING PARTY FOR TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. In the event that there is a dispute between the Parties with regard to the termination of or the right to terminate this Agreement and litigation is initiated, Buyer may elect to place into an escrow account an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price, less the Performance Deposit, pending the resolution of the litigation. If Buyer so elects, Seller shall place into an escrow account an amount equal to the Performance Deposit. 17.4 Confidentiality. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement remain in full force and effect, provided that if and when Closing occurs and effective on the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate to the extent (and only to the extent) it applies to the Properties conveyed at Closing. The foregoing notwithstanding, after Closing: (a) Seller shall continue to comply with all current Third Party confidentiality agreements, as applicable, with respect to the Records, (b) Seller shall treat the geological, geophysical and engineering Records in accordance with the same standards of conduct by which Seller treats its own geological, geophysical and engineering records, provided that nothing in (b) above shall be construed as prohibiting Seller from disclosing the Records or information contained therein (i) to an Affiliate, (ii) to a governmental agency or other entity when required by Law or to the extent such data and information is required to be furnished in compliance with any applicable Laws, or pursuant to any legal proceedings or because of any order of any court binding upon Seller or Seller's Affiliate, (iii) to prospective or actual contractors, consultants and attorneys employed by Seller where disclosure of such data or information is essential to such contractor's, consultant's or attorney's work, (iv) to co-owners or joint venturers and bona fide prospective transferees of Seller's ownership interest in properties to which the information relates, (v) to a bank or other financial institution in order to arrange for financing, (vi) to the extent that it must be disclosed pursuant to any rules or requirements of any government or stock exchange having jurisdiction over Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, and (vii) to the extent it, through no fault of Seller, becomes a part of the public domain, provided that, in the cases of (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) above, the person to whom such Records or information is disclosed shall maintain the confidentiality thereof in accordance with Article 17.4. 50
ARTICLE 18. ARBITRATION 18.1 Arbitration. Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved through use of binding arbitration using three (3) arbitrators, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") as in effect on January 11, 2003, as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code). If there is any inconsistency between this Article and the Commercial Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, this Article shall control. Arbitration must be initiated within the applicable time limits set forth in this Agreement and not thereafter or if no time limit is given, within the time period allowed by the applicable statute of limitations. Arbitration, if initiated, must be initiated by a Party ("CLAIMANT") serving written notice on the other Party ("RESPONDENT") that the Claimant elects to refer the Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimant's notice initiating arbitration must identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. The Respondent shall respond to Claimant within thirty (30) Days after receipt of Claimant's notice, identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If the Respondent does not name an arbitrator within the thirty (30) Day period, the administrator of the Houston office of the AAA shall provide the Parties with a list of potential arbitrators from the National Panel of Commercial Arbitrators maintained by the AAA (subject to the qualification requirements of this Article 18) and an arbitrator for Respondent's account shall be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section R-13.b of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. The two (2) arbitrators so chosen shall select a third arbitrator within thirty (30) Days after the second arbitrator has been appointed. If the Party-appointed arbitrators cannot reach agreement upon the third arbitrator within the thirty (30) Day period, the third arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section R-15.c of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of AAA, provided that, all potential arbitrators shall meet the qualification requirements of this Article 18. With respect to arbitrators selected using the procedures set out in R-13.b or R-15.c, if any, the AAA shall submit lists to the Parties until an arbitrator is selected and shall not have the power to make an appointment other than through the exchange of lists. The Parties each shall pay one-half of the compensation and expenses of the arbitrators. All arbitrators must (a) be neutral persons who have never been officers, directors, employees, or consultants or had other business relationships with the Parties or any of their Affiliates, officers, directors or employees, and (b) have not less than seven (7) years recent experience in the U.S. oil and gas industry relevant to the matters in dispute. The hearing will be conducted in Houston, Texas, and commence as soon as practicable after the selection of the third arbitrator. The Parties and the arbitrators should proceed diligently and in good faith so that the award can be made as promptly as possible. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the arbitrators shall be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties.

under clause 7, the same shall operate by way of increases or decreases, as the case may be, in the Consideration. The following principles shall apply in respect of the Adjustments and the Consideration: 3.3.1 No item taken into account in calculating any one Adjustment or other increases or decreases as the case may be under the Adjustment Clauses or clause 7 shall be taken into account in calculating any of the other Adjustments so as to result in a Party making or receiving payment twice in respect thereof nor will any Party be entitled under clause 6 to reimbursement of any payment received from a third party to the extent such payment has been taken into account (to the benefit of that Party) in calculating any of the Adjustments. 3.3.2 No adjustment to the Consideration shall be made in respect of any matter to which clauses 6.6 or 6.7 apply. 3.4 WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT The Working Capital Adjustment, which if positive shall increase the Consideration and if negative shall reduce the Consideration, shall be the sum of all the amounts calculated separately in respect of the Interests as at the Economic Date by reference to the statements provided by the relevant Operators and otherwise in accordance with Schedule 3. 3.5 CASH CALLS ADJUSTMENT The Cash Calls Adjustment, which if positive shall increase the Consideration and if negative shall reduce the Consideration, shall be the net sum of the total amounts specified in clauses 3.5.1 and 3.5.2: 3.5.1 the positive adjustments are the total amount of all cash calls, billing invoices, claims, demands or statements paid pursuant to the Licensed Interest Documents by the Seller or on behalf of the Seller by the Operator, and which accrue or relate to the period from the Economic Date until Completion; and 3.5.2 the negative adjustments are the total amount of all credits, receipts, income, reimbursements or recoveries of any kind (other than any credit, receipt, income, reimbursement or recovery, which forms part of the Petroleum Sales Adjustment under clause 3.7) received pursuant to the Licensed Interest Documents by the Seller or on behalf of the Seller by the Operator which accrue or relate to the period from the Economic Date until Completion. 3.6 NPR ADJUSTMENT The NPR Adjustment, which shall decrease the Consideration, shall be the sum of all income and other receipts received by the Seller (other than those dealt with by the Petroleum Sales Adjustment under clause 3.7 or otherwise dealt with in clause 3.5) in respect of the Interests during the Interim Period, provided that any such income or receipt which relates to any period prior to the Economic Date and -10-
which has not been taken into account in the Working Capital Adjustment shall be for the benefit of the Seller and shall not result in any adjustment to the Consideration. 3.7 PETROLEUM SALES ADJUSTMENT 3.7.1 The Petroleum Sales Adjustment, which shall decrease the Consideration, shall be the sum of all receipts for the sale and/or supply of Petroleum from and in relation to the Interests that, on and from the Economic Date and in respect of any Petroleum which (being Oil) is lifted or (being Raw Gas) is delivered at any time on and after the Economic Date, are received by or credited to the Seller. 3.7.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that no adjustment shall be made at Completion as part of the Petroleum Sales Adjustment in respect of any receipts for the sale and/or supply of Petroleum as aforesaid where such receipts have not been received by or credited to the Seller prior to the Completion Date. Instead, the Parties agree that forthwith following each receipt by or crediting to the Seller of any such receipts after Completion, the Seller shall pay Purchaser the amount in Dollars or Sterling (as appropriate) equal to such receipts. The Parties further agree that any payments made by the Seller to Purchaser under this clause 3.7.2 shall be treated as a reduction in the Consideration where any Petroleum (being Oil) is lifted or (being Raw Gas) is delivered prior to the Completion Date and shall not be so treated where such lifting or delivery takes place after the Completion Date. 3.7.3 Receipts attributed to Raw Gas in accordance with clause 3.7.1 shall be determined by reference to the price set out in the Raw Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement. Receipts attributed to Oil in accordance with clause 3.7.1 shall be determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the Platts Crude Oil Marketline quotations for each publication day for Forties Blend f.o.b. Hound Point in Dollars per barrel for the month of lifting in question. 3.8 INTERIM PERIOD ADJUSTMENT The Interim Period Adjustment, which shall increase the Consideration, shall be the sum of all expenditure incurred and paid in respect of the Interests by Seller including, without limitation, Licence Royalty, demurrage, brokers' fees (other than fees of stockbrokers and advisers engaged in relation to the matters referred to herein), employees salaries, rent, insurance premia and deductibles and all other costs and expenses incurred and paid by Seller in respect of the Interests during the Interim Period and which have not been met by cash calls or other payments taken into account under the foregoing provisions of this clause 3. Any such costs and expenses which relate to any period prior to the Economic Date and which have not been taken into account in the Working Capital Adjustment shall be for the cost of Seller and shall not result in any adjustment to the Consideration. -11-
INTERIM COMPLETION STATEMENT/ESTIMATE OF ADJUSTMENTS 3.9 Seller shall provide Purchaser with a written statement (being a consolidation of separate statements prepared in respect of each Interest, with the separate statements attached), of the Consideration in Dollars, giving an estimate of the sum of all Adjustments (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Working Capital Adjustment referred to under clause 3.4 and the Cash Calls Adjustment under clause 3.5) which are expected to be required as at the Completion Date, together with amounts equivalent to interest in accordance with clause 3.15 to be made hereunder in respect of the Interests. Such statement shall be provided no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to Completion. Seller may update the same and the Parties shall endeavour to agree the statement before Completion, failing which the matter shall be dealt with in accordance with clauses 3.11 and 3.12. This interim completion statement (the "Interim Completion Statement") shall be in the format set out in Schedule 4. 3.10 If any of the amounts or portions thereof contained in the Interim Completion Statement to be delivered pursuant to clause 3.9 have not been agreed or determined prior to Completion, the disputed amounts or portions of the Adjustments shall be left out of account and shall be dealt with as part of the Final Completion Statement in accordance with clauses 3.11 and 3.12, and the undisputed balances of the Adjustments shall be set off against each other. The resultant balance in relation to the Interests shall be added to or subtracted from (as the case may be) the amount of the Consideration stated in clause 3.1, and such amount so adjusted shall be payable at Completion. 3.11 FINAL COMPLETION STATEMENT/FINAL ADJUSTMENTS Within sixty days after Completion, and without prejudice to the provisions of clause 6, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a written statement (being a consolidation of separate statements prepared in respect of the Interests, with the separate statements attached), together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation, giving the final amount of the Consideration and all Adjustments to be made hereunder in respect of the Interests (including any amounts left out of account under clause 3.10) together with amounts equivalent to interest in accordance with clause 3.15. If the Parties shall fail to agree any such amounts in dispute (the "Disputed Amounts") within fifteen Business Days of receipt by Purchaser, the statement shall be referred for determination in accordance with the provisions of clause 3.12. Any amounts so agreed within fifteen Business Days (the "Second Adjustment"), to the extent not already paid or taken into account on Completion, shall be paid by Purchaser or Seller within five Business Days following agreement of the relevant Parties. Payment of the Disputed Amounts or portions thereof shall be made within five Business Days following either agreement of the Parties or determination under clause 3.12 (as the case may be). This final completion statement (the "Final Completion Statement") shall be in the format set out in Schedule 4. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this clause 3.11 shall not apply to any tax adjustments pursuant to clause 12. -12-
3.12 INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION If the Parties cannot reach agreement on the contents of all or part of the statements referred to in clauses 3.9 and/or 3.11 within the time limit provided in clause 3.11, the Disputed Amounts may be referred by any Party for determination by an independent chartered accountant nominated by the Parties or, in the absence of agreement between the Parties within five Business Days of a Party notifying the other that it proposes to refer the dispute to an expert, by the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Within ten Business Days after the appointment of such expert, each Party may submit to the expert a statement of the nature of the dispute, a description of the submitting Party's claims with respect thereto, and any other supporting documentation or materials with respect thereto that the submitting Party desires the expert to consider. The Party submitting such statement shall provide a copy thereof to the other Party, who shall have five Business Days from receipt thereof to submit an answering statement to the expert. The nominated chartered accountant shall be afforded such access to books, records, accounts and documents in the possession of the Parties as he may reasonably request, and he shall act as expert not as arbitrator. The said accountant's determination shall, in the absence of fraud or manifest error or bias, be final and binding on the Parties, his fees and disbursements shall be borne by Seller as to one half and Purchaser as to the other half and each Party shall bear its own costs in respect of such reference. 3.13 Seller shall provide Purchaser with copies of all Operator's reports, billing statements and correspondence and any and all other relevant documentation in its possession or under its control necessary to support the statements referred to in clauses 3.9 and 3.11. The Parties shall liaise on the compilation and agreement of the said statements. 3.14 FINANCIAL INFORMATION Both prior to and after Completion, Seller shall provide Purchaser with access to Seller's financial records for the Interests for the calendar years 2001 and 2002 which were previously made available to Seller's auditors for purposes of preparing Seller's annual audited and quarterly reviewed financial statements for those years and to Seller's corresponding financial records for any portion of 2003 prior to Completion, including in each case records with respect to direct operating costs with respect to each of the Interests and the net revenues from such Interests and such other information as may be required for Purchaser's Form 8-K filing with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

preparation or furnishing of any such records to Purchaser, any actions, representations or certifications of Seller's and its Affiliates' personnel or auditors with respect to the information contained in such records, or Purchaser's use of the information contained in such financial records, regardless of cause or of any negligent acts or omissions (including sole negligence, concurrent negligence or strict liability), breach of duty (statutory or otherwise), violation of law, or other fault of Seller Group, or any pre-existing defect. 3.15 TIME-VALUE ADJUSTMENTS 3.15.1 An amount equivalent to simple interest (calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 365 day year) at the Agreed Rate shall be payable to Seller on the amount of the Consideration stated in clause 3.1 from the Economic Date up to and including the Completion Date. 3.15.2 In respect of the Adjustments: (a) an amount equivalent to simple interest (calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 365 day year) at the Agreed Rate shall be payable on the Working Capital Adjustment from the Economic Date up to and including the Completion Date, and, in the case of that element of the Second Adjustment attributable to it or Disputed Amounts, thereafter up to and including the date of settlement thereof; (b) an amount equivalent to simple interest (calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 365 day year) at the Agreed Rate shall be payable on each cash call or invoice, claim, demand or statement (adjusted in accordance with clause 12) comprised in the Cash Calls Adjustment from the date on which such cash call or invoice, claim, demand or statement is paid by Seller up to and including the date of settlement of such element of the Cash Calls Adjustment; (c) an amount equivalent to simple interest (calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 365 day year) at the Agreed Rate shall be payable on each receipt comprised in the NPR Adjustment from the date such income is received by the Seller up to and including the date of settlement of such element of the NPR Adjustment; (d) an amount equivalent to simple interest (calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 365 day year) at the Agreed Rate shall be payable on each receipt comprised in the Petroleum Sales Adjustment from the date of such receipt by or credit to the Seller up to and including the date of settlement of such element of the Petroleum Sales Adjustment; and (e) an amount equivalent to simple interest (calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 365 day year) at the Agreed Rate shall be payable on each item of expenditure comprised in the Interim -14-

The Purchaser shall not be concerned to see to the application of any such amounts so paid. Likewise, where this Agreement provides for any payment to the Purchaser's Account, the Purchaser irrevocably authorises and instructs the Seller to make that payment to the Purchaser's Account, delivery to which account shall be an effective discharge of the Seller's obligation to pay the amount concerned. The Seller shall not be concerned to see to the application of any such amounts so paid. 4.

likely to continue for not less than one year from the date of such event, (or if for any reason the Parties are unable or unwilling to agree upon such estimate within fifteen (15) Business Days of a request to do so from either Party, estimated as aforesaid by an independent expert appointed by the Parties, or if the Parties are unable to agree on such appointment within twenty-four (24) hours, as appointed by the President of the Institute of Petroleum); then the Purchaser shall have the right as prescribed in clause 4.2.2 to terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to the Seller, without either Party having any liability to the other. Save in the event of fraud, the agreement of the Parties or the expert's determination, as the case may be, shall be final and binding on the Parties and the expert shall be deemed to be acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator. 4.2.2 If the Parties agree or the expert determines that a total shutdown as provided in clause 4.2.1 is likely to continue for not less than one (1) year from the date of such event, the Purchaser shall be entitled at any time prior to the close of business on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Parties reach agreement or receive the expert's determination to give notice to the Seller to terminate this Agreement. If the Purchaser does not give such a notice or is not entitled to give such a notice by reason of the Parties reaching agreement or the expert determining that a total shutdown is not likely to continue for one year or longer, then the Parties shall (subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the Conditions Precedent) proceed to Completion or if the date of Completion has been delayed pursuant to clause 4.2.3 then as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of such agreement or the receipt of such determination. 4.2.3 If the Parties' estimate or expert's determination referred to in clause 4.2.1 has not been agreed or received, as the case may be, by the Purchaser prior to the date which is five (5) Business Days prior to Completion then the Completion shall be delayed until after receipt by the Purchaser of the Parties' estimate or expert's determination (subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the Conditions Precedent). 4.2.4 If the Purchaser does not exercise any right it may have under this clause 4.2 to terminate this Agreement and proceeds to Completion, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and all other rights it may have hereunder or otherwise in relation to the event referred to in clause 4.2.1 it being accepted by the Parties that the right of termination shall be in lieu of any other right of the Purchaser in relation to such event, including any right to claim damages, make any claim in respect of the Warranties or seek any reduction in the Consideration. 4.2.5 The rights set out in this clause 4.2 shall not apply in respect of any event giving rise to physical damage to the Forties Field Facilities which occurs after Completion. -17-
4.3 INTERIM PERIOD RISK AND INSURANCE 4.3.1 Subject to clause 4.2 and the other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall accept the assets comprising the Interests in the physical condition in which they exist at the date of this Agreement and, notwithstanding that title will not pass until Completion, shall assume the risk of damage thereto or the destruction thereof as from the date of this Agreement. 4.3.2 The Purchaser shall with effect from the date of this Agreement until this Agreement is terminated or Completion takes place (as the case may be) ensure that the insurance coverage provided by its Global Insurance Program includes the Interests. The Purchaser will not vary such insurance coverage in respect of the Interests without the Seller's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Purchaser shall provide to the Seller evidence that the Interests have been included under the Global Insurance Program as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. 4.3.3 If after the date of this Agreement the Interests sustain damage or are destroyed, the Seller shall cooperate with and provide all reasonable assistance and provide all such relevant information to the Purchaser or its insurers (including such insurers' representatives and contractors) as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser or its insurers, so as to enable the Purchaser to effect recovery under the Global Insurance Program. 4.4 Without prejudice to clause 4.1, Seller shall (subject to any confidentiality obligations by which it is bound, from which obligations Seller shall use reasonable endeavours to procure its release) ensure that pending Completion the Purchaser is kept informed in a timely manner of all material matters in relation to the Interests, including, but not limited to: (a) the making of any cash call; (b) the approval of any AFE; (c) the adoption or proposal of, or amendment to, any work programmes and budgets; (d) the receipt of Operators' billing statements and invoices; and (e) the receipt of any Data. 4.5 After execution of this Agreement, Seller shall make available (during Seller's regular business hours and at their current location) for review by Purchaser and its representatives all Data. If Purchaser requests copies of any of the Data, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to provide the requested copy to Purchaser at Purchaser's expense. -18-
4.6 As soon as practicable after execution of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser will create a transition team ("TRANSITION TEAM") consisting of approximately three (3) persons on each side for the purpose of: (a) providing information and background to Purchaser and Purchaser's personnel relating to the operation of the Interests (including the provision of services under the FPS Platform Services Agreement); (b) providing liaison with the Employees and any other personnel of the Seller who are responsible for such operations; and (c) planning the anticipated transfer of operatorship of the Interests to Purchaser. Seller will allow the Purchaser's representatives on the Transition Team reasonable access to Seller's premises at Dyce, Aberdeen and to sites on-shore and off-shore associated with the operation of the Interests which sites are under Seller's control all at Purchaser's sole risk and expense. 5.

published by the Inland Revenue or other taxing authority (in whatever jurisdiction) and in force at the date of this Agreement; 7.9.2 occurs or arises or, such Relevant Claim otherwise having arisen, is increased as a result of anything voluntarily done or omitted to be done between the date of this Agreement and the Completion Date by Seller with the Purchaser's prior written consent (provided that Seller shall have acted as a reasonable and prudent operator and in accordance with generally accepted oilfield practices in the UKCS), or at Purchaser's prior written request; 7.9.3 occurs or arises or, such Relevant Claim otherwise having arisen, is increased as a result of any voluntary act, default, omission, transaction or arrangement after Completion by the Purchaser, in the ordinary course of its business as now carried on. 7.10 Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve Purchaser of any duty, whether at common law or otherwise, to mitigate any loss or damage incurred by it in respect of any breach by the Seller of the representations, warranties, indemnities or any other term of this Agreement or in respect of its subject matter. 7.11 Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover from Seller the same sum or loss more than once in respect of any Relevant Claim. 7.12 Seller shall not be liable in respect of any Relevant Claim to the extent that a provision or reserve has been or will be made in calculating the Adjustments in respect of the matter or transaction giving rise to such Relevant Claim. 8.

Stewart, Executive Vice-President, Business Development Facsimile: +(1) (713) 296 6459 10.2 In proving the giving of a notice it shall be sufficient to prove that the notice was left or that the envelope containing such notice was properly addressed and posted or that the applicable means of telecommunications was properly addressed and despatched (as the case may be). 10.3 Any notice duly given within the meaning of clause 10.1 shall be deemed to have been both given and received: 10.3.1 if it is delivered in accordance with clause 10.1.1, on such delivery; 10.3.2 if it is duly posted or transmitted in accordance with clause 10.1.2 by any of the methods there specified, on the second Business Day after the day of posting or (in the case of a notice transmitted by facsimile transmission) upon receipt by the sender of the correct transmission report. 10.4 For the purposes of this clause 10 "notice" shall include any request, demand, instructions or other document. 11. COSTS AND EXPENSES 11.1 Save as stated in clause 11.3, Seller and Purchaser shall each pay its and its Affiliates' own costs, expenses, duties and, except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing, taxation in relation to the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the documents contemplated hereby or executed pursuant hereto. 11.2 Without prejudice to any other rights hereunder, if any amount payable hereunder is not paid when due, the defaulting Party shall pay interest on such amount from the due date of payment (after as well as before judgment) at a rate equal to three per cent (3%) above the Agreed Rate calculated on a compounded basis on the -34-
accumulated daily balances. The Parties agree that this constitutes a substantial contractual remedy. 11.3 Subject to the terms of the stamp duty agreement between Seller and Purchaser of even date herewith, Purchaser shall be responsible for payment in a timely fashion of any and all stamp duties and charges payable on or in respect of this Agreement, the Completion Documents, any related agreements and in respect of its or their subject matter and any similar duties and charges wheresoever arising. 12. TAXATION 12.1 12.1.1 Purchaser warrants that prior to Completion it will be registered for VAT in the United Kingdom and that it intends to use the Interests for its own trade of exploration/exploitation. 12.1.2 Seller warrants that it is registered for VAT in the United Kingdom. 12.2 12.2.1 Seller has incurred qualifying expenditure and/or has an amount of residue of expenditure in respect of mineral exploration and access allocations (as defined for the purposes of the Capital Allowances Act 2001) on each of (i) plant and machinery relating to the Interests and (ii) mineral exploration and access to which Consideration is allocated under Schedule 2 of an amount in respect of each such item at least equal to the amount so allocated to that item. 12.2.2 Seller has complied in all material respects with obligations relating to PAYE as they apply to the Employees. 12.2.3 Seller has kept and maintained proper books and records in respect of the Interests to the extent required by applicable United Kingdom taxation laws (including those books and records relevant to VAT and PRT) and to the extent necessary to enable Purchaser to comply with its United Kingdom tax obligations or to obtain tax rebates or other tax benefits in respect of the Interests, has made available to Purchaser copies of such books and records. 12.3 Purchaser undertakes that it will use the Interests acquired as part of its going concern for a sufficient period to comply with the requirements of Article 5 of the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995, so that the transfer thereof is neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services for VAT purposes. 12.4 The Parties believe that the transfer hereunder is a transaction which is outside the scope of VAT by virtue of Article 5 of the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions) Order 1995 and/or that the transfer contemplated hereby is of a right over land situated outside the United Kingdom and as such will be treated as outside the scope of Value Added Tax by virtue of Article 5 of the Value Added -35-
Tax (Place of Supply of Services) Order 1995. However, if Seller is advised in writing by HM Customs and Excise that such transaction is subject to VAT, Seller shall promptly inform Purchaser and shall co-operate with Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably request and at Purchaser's cost to persuade HM Customs and Excise that such transaction is not subject to VAT. In any event, Purchaser undertakes to pay to Seller, on delivery of a valid VAT invoice, any amounts due in respect of VAT within thirty (30) days of demand. 12.5 The Parties agree that Seller shall make application to the HM Customs and Excise under section 49(1)(b) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 for a direction that the records relating to the Interests which under paragraph 6 Schedule 11 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 have been maintained by Seller should be preserved by Seller notwithstanding the provisions of the said section. Seller shall forthwith upon receipt thereof provide the Purchaser with a copy of any such direction, and Purchaser shall retain access at all reasonable times during normal business hours to all books and records retained by Seller or its Affiliates in relation to VAT matters concerning the Interests, and Seller covenants to retain such records as required by paragraph 6 Schedule 11 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994. 12.6 Seller confirms that no election has been made and that no election will be made prior to the Completion Date under paragraph 2, Schedule 10 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 in relation to any of the Interests. 12.7 Reimbursements pursuant to clause 3 (Adjustments) shall be exclusive of VAT which Seller may be required to charge and, if called upon to do so by Seller, Purchaser undertakes to pay Seller on presentation of a VAT invoice any amounts properly due in respect of VAT set out in such invoice within thirty (30) days of demand. 12.8 Subject to clause 12.4 above, any adjustments pursuant to clause 3, clause 6.4 or clause 7 in respect of any payment or receipt being an amount in respect of which VAT has been paid or received shall be made on a basis disregarding the VAT element where the VAT paid is fully deductible or is required to be accounted for in full to HM Customs & Excise, but otherwise shall be made on a basis which leaves Seller in no better and no worse a position (after taking account of VAT, and subject to the application of the other provisions of this clause 12) than had the payment or receipt not been made or received. 12.9 In relation to each part of the Interests being an interest in an oil field (within the meaning of Schedule 1 to the Oil Taxation Act 1975), Seller shall prepare and Purchaser and Seller shall deliver to the Board of Inland Revenue in a timely fashion a notice under paragraph 3 of Schedule 17 Finance Act 1980, and shall not make application under paragraph 4 of the said Schedule for the provisions of Parts II and III of the Schedule not to apply. 12.10 The Parties acknowledge that in the periods up to Completion Seller may have incurred expenditure in relation to some or all of the Fields which can be claimed for PRT purposes under either Schedule 5 or 6 to the Oil Taxation Act 1975. Seller shall take all actions and do all things reasonably in its power to ensure that -36-
any such expenditure is claimed and, in particular, Seller shall prepare and sign all Schedule 6 claims in respect of such expenditure and provide copies of the same to Purchaser on or before Completion. 12.11 Seller and Purchaser agree that the allocation with respect to the Interests set out in Schedule 2 is a just apportionment of the Consideration. Seller and Purchaser agree that they will each present their returns for tax purposes on the basis of said allocation and that they will use all reasonable endeavours to agree with the OTO the figures so presented. 12.12 Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that, except as provided in clause 12.13 below, the Consideration represents expenditure incurred by the Purchaser in acquiring plant and machinery relating to the Interests only to the extent shown by the allocations set out in Schedule 2. Seller covenants that it will treat the said allocated expenditure on plant and machinery as disposal proceeds for the purposes of sections 60 and 61 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001, and Purchaser covenants that it will treat such amount as capital expenditure incurred for the purposes of Part 2 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. 12.13 Insofar as the Consideration is increased pursuant to clause 3, clause 6.4 or clause 7 by reference to expenditure qualifying for capital allowances under Part 2 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001 incurred by Seller, the allocation of the Consideration to expenditure incurred by Purchaser in relation to the relevant part of the Interests in acquiring plant and machinery, as set out in Schedule 2, shall be increased by a corresponding amount. 12.14 Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that it is not just and reasonable to attribute any part of the Consideration to allowable scientific research expenditure of a capital nature or mineral exploration and access except to the extent of the amounts set out in Schedule 2, and Seller and Purchaser undertake to submit to the Inland Revenue computations of liability to CT on that basis and not on any basis which is inconsistent therewith; and for the purposes of this paragraph, the expression "mineral exploration and access" shall have the same meaning as in Part 5 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. 12.15 Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that the Consideration is in respect of expenditure incurred by Purchaser on the construction of industrial buildings or structures within the meaning of Part 3 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001 only to the extent shown by the allocations set out in Schedule 2. Seller and Purchaser undertake to submit to the Inland Revenue computations of liability to CT on the basis that such allocations represent the sale moneys for the purposes of Part 3, Chapter 7 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. 12.16 For the avoidance of doubt no part of the Consideration payable by Purchaser to Seller falls to be treated as intangible drilling costs on production wells qualifying for relief under Part 5 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001. 12.17 Seller shall be liable for any liabilities arising under Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 1973 in respect of the Interests for periods ending prior to the Economic Date, and Purchaser shall be liable for all periods thereafter. -37-
12.18 Subject to clause 12.24, if any liability for or right to repayment of PRT in connection with the Interests which relates to the period of ownership prior to the Economic Date of Seller arises after the Economic Date and the adjustment giving rise to such liability or right is in respect of income and expenditure of Seller during such period of ownership then the liability or repayment shall be the responsibility or entitlement of Seller. Any repayment of PRT in connection with the Interests arising otherwise than in respect of Seller's period of ownership prior to the Economic Date shall be the entitlement of the Purchaser. 12.19 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall retain access to all books and records and operator information in relation to PRT income and expenditure claims under Schedules 5 and 6 of the Oil Taxation Act 1975 in relation to the Interests for all periods ended prior to the Completion Date. Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practical, ensure that all documentation relating to any PRT assessments, returns or claims issued by the Inland Revenue or Operators in respect of such periods, is communicated to Seller without unreasonable delay. 12.20 The Parties agree that all adjustments to Licence Royalty whether increases or decreases will be payable or receivable by Seller. 12.21 PRT ADJUSTMENTS The following provisions of this clause 12.21 are subject to the provisions of clause 12.26. 12.21.1 The Consideration shall be increased by Purchaser paying to Seller the following sums: (a) a sum equal to the amount of any PRT instalment paid by Seller in relation to the Interests under paragraph 2, Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1982 which, by virtue of paragraph 2(3) of the said Schedule, is regarded as a payment of PRT in respect of any Chargeable Period beginning on or after the Economic Date. Seller undertakes to withhold payment of such PRT instalments in accordance with paragraph 3 of said Schedule if the relevant conditions are met; (b) a sum equal to any amount of PRT assessed on, and paid by Seller in relation to the Interests, for any Chargeable Period mentioned in (a) above less amounts already paid by Purchaser under this paragraph (a) above. For the purpose of calculating any sums due under paragraph (b) above, PRT assessed on, and paid by Seller for the Chargeable Period including the Economic Date shall be recalculated to exclude any amounts brought into the assessment under section 2(4)(b) of the Oil Taxation Act 1975. For the purposes of calculating any sums due under paragraph (b) above the PRT assessed on, and paid by Seller for the Chargeable Period including the Economic Date or any subsequent Chargeable Period shall -38-
be recalculated to exclude any amounts brought into the assessment under section 2(6)(b) of the Oil Taxation Act 1975. (c) a sum equal to any effective PRT relief received by Purchaser, in relation to the Interests, either by way of a refund of PRT or a reduction in PRT due, in respect of any expenditure incurred by Seller prior to the Economic Date; and (d) a sum equal to any effective PRT relief received by Purchaser, in relation to the Interests, either by way of a refund of PRT or a reduction in PRT due in respect of expenditure incurred by Seller after the Economic Date which does not relate to the Interests. Seller and Purchaser shall use all reasonable endeavours to persuade the OTO that PRT relief in respect of the expenditure referred to in (d) above should be received by Seller and not Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller recognise that amendments of assessments to PRT may arise and to the extent that any amendment gives rise to overpayments having been paid by Purchaser to Seller under this clause 12.21 Seller will promptly repay to Purchaser, as a decrease in the Consideration on, any such overpayment. Purchaser and Seller also recognise that sums paid under paragraph (a) above may be in excess of the PRT assessed on Seller in which case paragraph (b) above shall not apply and Seller shall promptly pay to Purchaser, as a decrease in the Consideration, any repayment made by the Inland Revenue in respect of that excess. 12.21.2 For the purposes of calculating any sums payable under clause 12.21.1, the calculation of PRT shall be modified as follows: To the extent that clause 3.7.3 (Petroleum Sales Adjustment) operates, such PRT calculation shall be based on the amounts so amended by clause 3.7.3 and not the petroleum revenue included in the PRT return for the relevant sales. 12.21.3 (a) Increases to the Consideration arising under clauses 12.21.1(a) and 12.21.1(b) above shall be due for payment within thirty (30) days of Seller submitting reasonable documentary evidence to Purchaser in support of any request for payment. (b) Increases to the Consideration arising under clauses 12.21.1(c) and 12.21.1(d) above shall be due for payment within thirty (30) days of Purchaser having received effective PRT relief. (c) Decreases to the Consideration arising under the last paragraph of clause 12.21.1 above shall be due for payment within thirty (30) days of Seller receiving any PRT refund or within thirty (30) days of Purchaser having paid any PRT as the case may be. -39-
12.21.4 To the extent that Seller has a PRT liability arising in respect of a Chargeable Period within the Interim Period and expenditure relief for that Chargeable Period has been transferred to Purchaser under Paragraph 6 Schedule 17 Finance Act 1980 then, at the request of Seller, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly elect under Paragraph 14 Schedule 17 Finance Act 1980 to transfer the loss from Purchaser to Seller. 12.22 CT ADJUSTMENTS The provisions of this clause 12.22 are subject to the provisions of clause 12.26. 12.22.1 The Consideration shall be increased by Purchaser paying to Seller an amount equal to Notional CT paid by Seller on any income or other receipts taken into account for the purposes of clause 3. 12.22.2 The Consideration shall be decreased by Seller paying to Purchaser an amount equal to: (a) Notional CT relief received by Seller on: (i) any cash calls paid and taken into account for the purposes of clause 3 (but excluding any expenditure which qualifies for capital allowances pursuant to clause 12.13); (ii) any expenditure taken into account for the purposes of clause 3 (but excluding any expenditure which qualifies for capital allowances pursuant to clause 12.13); and (iii) any PRT paid, net of any PRT repayments received by Seller and taken into account for the purposes of clauses 12.21.1(a) and 12.21.1(b); and (b) Notional CT paid by Purchaser on, or arising from the effective PRT relief received by Purchaser and referred to under clauses 12.21.1(c) and (d). 12.22.3 The Parties recognise that adjustments to the Consideration under this clause 12.22 are notional adjustments, as opposed to actual payments of, reliefs from or reductions in CT liabilities. For the purpose of calculating the Notional CT it shall be assumed that both Seller and Purchaser are single companies with no brought forward losses who are paying CT at the standard rate applicable for the period concerned and that the Notional CT includes the Supplementary Charge to ring fence trades. Such notional adjustments shall be effected by deducting from each relevant payment a Notional CT charge. -40-
12.23 INTEREST ON LATE PAYMENT OF PRT 12.23.1 The Consideration shall be increased by Purchaser paying to Seller a sum equal to any interest charged to Seller under paragraph 15 of Schedule 2 to the Oil Taxation Act 1975, in respect of PRT in relation to the Interests for Chargeable Periods beginning on or after the Economic Date provided that the underpayment of PRT giving rise to the interest charge was not caused by the wilful default or neglect of Seller. 12.23.2 The Consideration shall be decreased by Seller paying to Purchaser a sum equal to any interest received by Seller under paragraph 16 of the Schedule 2 to the Oil Taxation Act 1975 in respect of PRT in relation to the Interests for Chargeable Periods beginning on or after the Economic Date. Adjustments to Consideration under this clause 12.23 shall be made within 30 days of Seller having received any PRT interest or having paid any PRT interest, as the case may be. 12.24 Should Seller receive any PRT refund as a result of a loss incurred by Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 15 of Schedule 17 to the Finance Act 1980, Seller shall within ten Business Days pay Purchaser an amount equal to the PRT refund together with any interest thereon less any CT payable by Seller on such refund and/or such interest and less any interest on such CT payable. 12.25 INFORMATION 12.25.1 Seller shall provide Purchaser in a timely fashion with copies of all records and tax returns relating to periods prior to the Completion Date and relating wholly or partly to the Interests which are reasonably required by Purchaser for the purposes of completing and filing any tax return. 12.25.2 Each Party shall use its reasonable endeavours to provide written advice to the other Party of any event giving rise to an adjustment under clause 6.4 within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such an event. This advice will include a copy of such documentary evidence, as is reasonably deemed to be necessary by the other Party, to verify the adjustment. 12.25.3 Seller shall prepare and submit on a timely basis to the OTO all claims reasonably possible under Schedule 6 to the Oil Taxation Act 1975 in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred by Seller from the Economic Date. 12.26 Seller and Purchaser agree that the overriding principle in respect of PRT adjustments and CT adjustments as provided for in clauses 12.21 and 12.22 is to put the Parties in the same position as they would have been in had Completion taken place on the Economic Date. -41-
12.27 INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION If the Parties cannot reach agreement on the contents of all or part of the adjustments referred to in clauses 12.21 and/or 12.22 within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt by Purchaser from Seller of Seller's estimate of such adjustments, the adjustments in dispute may be referred by any Party for determination by an independent expert nominated by the Parties or, in the absence of agreement between the Parties within five (5) Business Days of a Party notifying the other that it proposes to refer the dispute to an expert, by the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Within twenty (20) Business Days after the appointment of such expert, each Party may submit to the expert a statement of the nature of the dispute, a description of the submitting Party's claims with respect thereto, and any other supporting documentation or materials with respect thereto that the submitting Party desires the expert to consider. The Party submitting such statement shall provide a copy thereof to the other Party, who shall have ten (10) Business Days from receipt thereof to submit an answering statement to the expert. The nominated expert shall be afforded such access to books, records, accounts and documents in the possession of the Parties as he may reasonably request, and he shall act as expert not as arbitrator. The said expert's determination shall, in the absence of fraud or manifest error or bias, be final and binding on the Parties, his fees and disbursements shall be borne by Seller as to one half and Purchaser as to the other half and each Party shall bear its own costs in respect of such reference. 13. VARIATION The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall only be varied by an agreement in writing signed by each of the Parties and specifically referring to this Agreement. 14.

MATTERS NOT TO REDUCE THE PURCHASER'S GUARANTOR'S LIABILITY 3.1 If any purported obligation or liability of the Purchaser under the Sale and Purchase Agreement or the Stamp Duty Agreement which, if valid, would have been the subject of this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity is not or ceases to be valid or enforceable on any ground by reason of any defect in or want of powers of the Purchaser or irregular exercise thereof or lack of authority by any person apparently authorised to act on behalf of the Purchaser or any legal incapacity or any change in the constitution of or any amalgamation, reconstruction or liquidation of the Purchaser, the Purchaser's Guarantor shall nevertheless be liable in respect of that purported obligation or liability as if the same were fully valid and enforceable and as if the Purchaser's Guarantor were the principal debtor in respect thereof. The Purchaser's Guarantor hereby agrees to keep the Seller fully indemnified in accordance with the terms of this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity against all Losses and Expenses arising from any failure of the Purchaser to carry out any such purported obligation or liability by reason of it not being or ceasing to be valid or enforceable as aforesaid. 3.2 The Purchaser's Guarantor undertakes that if any of the Guaranteed Obligations are not recoverable on the basis of a guarantee for any reason, it will (as a separate and independent stipulation) pay the Seller on demand whatever amount or amounts shall equal what it would have been liable to pay but for such irrecoverability. 3.3 The Guaranteed Obligations shall be discharged by the full performance by the Purchaser of its obligations under the Sale and Purchase Agreement and the Stamp Duty Agreement, but otherwise shall not be discharged or affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this provision, might operate to release or otherwise exonerate the Purchaser's Guarantor from those obligations in whole or in part including: 6
3.3.1 the granting of time, or any waiver or other indulgence (including any extension, renewal, acceptance, forbearance or release in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations); 3.3.2 the taking, variation, compromise, renewal or release of or refusal or neglect to perform or enforce any rights, remedies or securities against the Purchaser; 3.3.3 any modification, variation or addition to the terms of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any other document or security; 3.3.4 any irregularity, defect or informality in the terms of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other document or security or any legal limitation, disability, incapacity or want of authority of any person other than the Seller or its Affiliates; 3.3.5 any corporate reorganisation, reconstruction, amalgamation, dissolution, liquidation, merger, acquisition of or by or other alteration in the corporate existence or structure of the Seller or the Purchaser or the Purchaser's Guarantor; 3.3.6 any composition or similar arrangement by the Seller or the Purchaser or the Purchaser's Guarantor or any other person; or 3.3.7 any other act or thing whatsoever done or omitted or neglected to be done by the Seller in relation to the Guaranteed Obligations. 4.

DISCHARGE Where any discharge (whether in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise) is made in whole or in part or any 7
arrangement is made on the faith of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored for any reason, the liability of the Purchaser's Guarantor under this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity shall continue as if the discharge or arrangement had not been made. 6. ENFORCEMENT 6.1 The Seller shall not be obliged before taking steps to enforce this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity: 6.1.1 to take any action or obtain judgement in any court against the Purchaser or any other person; 6.1.2 to make or file any claim in any bankruptcy or liquidation (or its equivalent in an relevant jurisdiction) of the Purchaser or of any other person; 6.1.3 to make, enforce or seek to enforce any claim against the Purchaser or any other person under any security or other document, agreement or arrangement; or 6.1.4 to enforce against and/or realise (or seek so to do) any security that it may have in respect of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations. 7.

licence, permit or consent by which Purchaser's Guarantor or any of its Affiliates or any of its assets is bound or affected; and 7.1.4 no litigation, arbitration, administrative proceeding, dispute or judgment against Purchaser's Guarantor or to which Purchaser's Guarantor is a party which is reasonably likely to by itself or together with any such other proceedings have a material adverse effect on its business, assets or condition and which would materially and adversely affect its ability to observe or perform its obligations under this Deed of Guarantee and Indemnity, is subsisting or, so far as Purchaser's Guarantor is aware, threatened or pending against Purchaser's Guarantor or any of its assets. 8.

LETTER OF CREDIT 9.1.1 If at any time the credit rating of the senior, unsubordinated, unsecured long term debt of the Purchaser's Guarantor ("Guarantor's Rating") falls below both "A-" by Standard and Poor's and "A3" by Moody's (or such other comparable credit rating agency or agencies as may be proposed by the Purchaser's Guarantor and approved by the Seller such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) (the "Relevant Rating") or is removed by both such rating agencies, then the Purchaser's Guarantor shall supply to the Seller a Letter of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 9 failing which it shall forthwith pay an amount equal to the face value of the Letter of Credit which should have been supplied into the LC Trust Account. Each Letter of Credit delivered pursuant to this Clause 9 shall have an expiry date of 31st December in the year for which the calculation of "Annual C", "Interim Annual C" or "Provisional Annual C" has been determined. 9
9.1.2 The Letter of Credit shall be renewed on or prior to its expiry date in accordance with Clause 9.6 unless a Guarantor's Rating is increased or reinstated to a rating level at least equivalent to either Relevant Rating. If at any time either Guarantor's Rating is increased or reinstated to a rating level at least equivalent to a Relevant Rating any then outstanding Letter of Credit shall forthwith be returned by the Seller to the Purchaser's Guarantor for surrender and cancellation. 9.2 Amount of Letters of Credit Subject as provided in this Clause 9, within 10 London and New York business days of the occurrence of a Rating Loss Date the Purchaser's Guarantor will supply a Letter of Credit in the amount of Interim Annual C (or if Annual C or Provisional Annual C shall have been previously calculated or determined for that relevant period, that amount), in each case less any Supplemental Security. 9.3 Calculation of the Annual C 9.3.1 (A) Calculation of Annual C shall be commenced and completed in accordance with this Clause 9 as soon as reasonably practicable after any Calculation Event, provided that if at any time the event that caused the Calculation Event ceases to apply then that calculation of Annual C shall cease and this Clause 9 shall not apply (save for Clause 9.3.3(D) and the provisions of Clauses 9.5 and 9.12, to the extent relevant) unless and until a further Calculation Event shall occur. (B) The Purchaser's Guarantor, acting reasonably, shall give the Seller its calculation of Annual C by no later than 1 month after the Calculation Event together with reasonable supporting calculations and documentation. The Seller shall give notice to the Purchaser's Guarantor within 1 month of receipt of that calculation stating whether it approves or disapproves the calculation of Annual C, and in the event that it fails to give such a notice within such period, it shall be deemed to have approved such calculation of Annual C. 9.3.2 Annual C shall thereafter be calculated for each subsequent calendar year, (provided that if the event that caused the Calculation Event ceases to apply then that calculation of Annual C shall cease and this Clause 9 shall not apply (save for Clause 9.3.3(D) and the provisions of Clauses 9.5 and 9.12, to the extent relevant) unless and until a further Calculation Event shall occur) by the Purchaser's Guarantor, acting reasonably, and will be provided to the Seller, together with reasonable supporting calculations and documentation, no later than 6 months before the expiry 10
date of the current Letter of Credit. The Seller shall give notice to the Purchaser's Guarantor within 1 month of receipt of that calculation stating whether it approves or disapproves the calculation of the Annual C, and in the event that it fails to give such a notice within such period, it shall be deemed to have approved such calculation of Annual C. 9.3.3 (A) If the Seller disapproves the calculation of the Annual C, then, by no later than 10 days after receipt by the Purchaser's Guarantor of the Seller's notice of disapproval, an independent expert shall be appointed to determine the value of Annual C. The independent expert shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Parties and in the absence of agreement shall be appointed on the application of either Party by the President for the time being of the Institute of Petroleum in England (or any successor body thereto). (B) The independent expert shall be a firm of engineers skilled by reason of its qualification, experience and expertise in the estimation of abandonment costs for offshore oil and gas facilities. (C) The independent expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, it shall be appointed on the basis that it keeps strictly confidential to the Parties all information provided to it by the Parties hereunder and its decision shall, in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding on the Parties. (D) The costs of the independent expert shall be borne as to fifty per cent (50%) by the Seller and fifty per cent (50%) by the Purchaser's Guarantor. (E) The Purchaser's Guarantor shall use its best endeavours to provide such data as the independent expert may reasonably require for the purposes of its determination. 9.3.4 Where an independent expert has been appointed it shall review the calculation of Annual C provided by the Purchaser's Guarantor and any calculation of Annual C provided by the Seller. The Purchaser's Guarantor shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the independent expert will notify the Seller and the Purchaser's Guarantor in writing by no later than the date falling 1 month after the date of its appointment of its approval of the calculation of Annual C by the Purchaser's Guarantor or (if any) the Seller or (where it approves neither) its own determination of Annual C. If the independent expert fails to 11
notify the Purchaser's Guarantor and the Seller as aforesaid, by the date falling 2 months after the date of its appointment then:- (A) (save where paragraph (B) below applies), the average of the respective estimates of Annual C prepared by the Purchaser's Guarantor and the Seller, will thereupon be the Annual C, or if no estimate has been provided by the Seller, the estimate provided by the Purchaser's Guarantor will thereupon be Annual C (such calculation or estimate being the "Provisional Annual C"). Annual C or the Provisional Annual C shall, less any Supplemental Security, (and subject as provided in Clause 9.3.5) determine the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit to be provided for the remainder of the calendar year; and (B) if an amount for Annual C has previously been determined and a Letter of Credit is outstanding calculated by reference to it or would have been but for a payment into the LC Trust Account under clause 9.1, the Annual C shall remain at the level last determined (such amount being the "Provisional Annual C"). Annual C or the Provisional Annual C shall, less any Supplemental Security, (and subject as provided in Clause 9.3.5) determine the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit to be provided for the following calendar year. In the event that the aggregate undrawn amount of the outstanding Letter of Credit issued pursuant to Clause 9.2, together with the Supplemental Security:- (C) is less than the value of Provisional Annual C calculated in accordance with Clause 9.4 the Purchaser's Guarantor shall, within 3 months of the date of appointment of the independent expert, deliver to the Seller a further Letter of Credit in an amount which, when taken together with all other undrawn amounts under any outstanding Letter of Credit and the Supplemental Security, equals the value of the Provisional Annual C; or (D) is more than the calculated value of Provisional Annual C, the Purchaser's Guarantor may, by the date of expiry of the outstanding Letter of Credit, deliver to the Seller a Letter of Credit in an amount which, together with the Supplemental Security, equals the value of the Provisional Annual C and the Seller shall promptly return to the Purchaser's Guarantor for surrender, upon the receipt of the replacement Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit which has been replaced. 12
9.3.5 If the independent expert notifies the Seller and the Purchaser's Guarantor that it has approved the calculation of Annual C of either the Seller or the Purchaser's Guarantor or has determined its own calculation of Annual C, then Annual C shall be the amount so approved or determined by the independent expert and where the amount so approved or determined is: (A) greater than the value of the Interim C or Provisional Annual C, then the Purchaser's Guarantor shall provide a further Letter of Credit in a sum which, together with the Supplemental Security, represents the difference between the value of the Interim Annual C or Provisional Annual C (as the case may be) and the amount so approved or determined as Annual C by the expert, within one month of such notification from the expert (or, if later, by no later than one month prior to the date the new Annual C is to become effective); or (B) is less than the value of Interim Annual C or the Provisional Annual C, then the Purchaser's Guarantor may provide a Letter of Credit in a sum, together with the Supplemental Security, equal to the amount of the Annual C so approved or determined by the expert and the Seller shall promptly return to the Purchaser's Guarantor for surrender, upon the receipt of the replacement Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit which has been replaced. 9.3.6 Each of "C", "Interim Annual C", "Annual C" and "Provisional Annual C" shall be determined in Sterling. 9.3.7 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the Purchaser's Guarantor fails to supply its calculation of Annual C to the Seller by the date specified in this Clause 9.3, then (without prejudice to any other remedies available to the Seller), for the relevant calendar year, the amount of Annual C shall be the then value of Interim Annual C. 9.4 Purchaser's Guarantor's obligation to provide further Letter of Credit for an increase in Annual C In the event that the aggregate undrawn amount of the outstanding Letter of Credit, together with the Supplemental Security: 9.4.1 is less than the value of Annual C calculated in accordance with Clause 9.3, the Purchaser's Guarantor shall, by no later than one month prior to the date of expiry of the outstanding Letter of Credit, deliver to the Seller a further Letter of Credit in an amount which, when taken together with all other undrawn amounts under any outstanding Letter of Credit and the Supplemental Security, equals the value of the Annual C; or 13
9.4.2 is more than the calculated value of the Annual C, the Purchaser's Guarantor may no later than one month prior to the date of expiry of the outstanding Letter of Credit, deliver to the Seller a Letter of Credit in an amount which, together with the Supplemental Security, equals the value of the Annual C and the Seller shall promptly return to the Purchaser's Guarantor for surrender, upon the receipt of the replacement Letter of Credit, the Letter of Credit which has been replaced. 9.5 Provision of information (A) The Purchaser's Guarantor shall at all times following Completion provide to the Seller in a timely manner data and information relating to the Interests which may have a material and adverse effect on one or more of the fields comprising the Interests or on the level of Abandonment Costs. (B) If the Seller considers that an event has occurred which is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Interests the Purchaser's Guarantor shall use its best endeavours to provide to the Seller in a timely manner data and information relating to the effect of the event on the Interests; and (C) Within 5 London and New York business days of the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Purchaser's Guarantor of its audited annual consolidated accounts, the Purchaser's Guarantor will notify the Seller of the updated amount of Interim Annual C together with a certificate from an officer of the Purchaser's Guarantor confirming that such figure is the amount used by the Purchaser's Guarantor for the asset retirement obligations associated with the Interests for the purposes of its most recent annual audited financial statements, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 9.6 Obligation to produce Letter of Credit before expiry of then current Letter of Credit The Purchaser's Guarantor shall no later than thirty (30) days before the expiry date of the then current Letter of Credit deliver to the Seller a replacement Letter of Credit in the amount of the expiring Letter of Credit (unless a different amount is otherwise provided for hereunder) and forthwith return to the Purchaser's Guarantor for cancellation, the Letter of Credit which has been replaced. 14
9.7 Reduction of undrawn amount under the Letter of Credit Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 9 the aggregate undrawn amount required to be outstanding at any time under the Letter of Credit provided to the Seller pursuant to this Clause 9 shall be reduced by the aggregate of: 9.7.1 the value of any security or other equivalent cover in respect of Abandonment Costs provided by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any document provided in accordance with the provisions of any JOA or pursuant to any scheme or requirement of the Secretary or any applicable law or guidance; 9.7.2 the aggregate credit balance standing to the credit of any trust fund established by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the provisions of any JOA or pursuant to any scheme or requirement of the Secretary or any applicable law or guidance; and 9.7.3 the aggregate credit balance in the LC Trust Account, provided that the aggregate undrawn amount referred to in this Clause 9.7 shall only be reduced if either (a) the Purchaser's Guarantor has procured that the Seller has become a party to the relevant JOA or such other agreement which governs the matters referred to in Clauses 9.7.1 and 9.7.2 with all rights in respect of such matters only but with no obligations such that the Seller will have the benefit of any security or other equivalent cover or trust fund referred to in Clauses 9.7.1 or 9.7.2; or (b) the Secretary will participate in any security or other equivalent cover or trust fund referred to in Clauses 9.7.1 or 9.7.2 and the Seller, acting reasonably, is satisfied that the arrangements are such that the amounts in question are and will remain available to be applied towards the Abandonment Costs and will be so applied to the extent required. 9.8 Events giving rise to demands under Letter of Credit The Seller shall be entitled to draw on the then current Letter of Credit if any of the following circumstances occur: 9.8.1 the Purchaser's Guarantor is in breach of Clause 9.6 by failing to deliver a replacement Letter of Credit in which case the Seller shall be entitled to draw down: (A) if no replacement Letter of Credit is provided, the whole of any Letter of Credit which the Purchaser's Guarantor was obliged to replace pursuant to Clause 9.6; or 15

This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that is important to you. You should carefully read this prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the other documents we refer to and incorporate by reference for a more complete understanding of us and this offering. In particular, we incorporate important business and financial information in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus by reference. Unless otherwise indicated, all information in this prospectus supplement assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option. Unless otherwise stated, the dollar amounts and financial data contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are presented in U.S. dollars. Unless this prospectus supplement otherwise indicates or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," "us" or "Apache" as used in this prospectus supplement refer to Apache Corporation. APACHE CORPORATION Apache Corporation is an independent energy company that, directly and through subsidiaries, explores for, acquires and develops oil and gas reserves and produces natural gas, crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. In North America, our exploration and production interests are focused on the Gulf of Mexico, the Anadarko Basin, the Permian Basin, the Gulf Coast and the Western Sedimentary Basin of Canada. Outside North America, we currently have exploration and production interests offshore Western Australia, Argentina and in Egypt and exploration interests in Poland and offshore The People's Republic of China. Through September 30, 2002, our average daily production was: -- 162 Mbbls of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids; and -- 1,082 MMcf of natural gas. As of December 31, 2001, our worldwide proved reserves totaled 1,267 MMboe, including: -- 599 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids; and -- 4,005 Bcf of natural gas. STRATEGY Our strategy is to increase our oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves: -- exploiting our existing asset base; -- acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value; and -- investing in high-potential exploration prospects. Exploiting Our Existing Asset Base. We seek to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while controlling per unit operating costs. In order to achieve these objectives, we rigorously examine our operations to reduce costs, identify production enhancement initiatives such as workovers and recompletions employing new technology, and divest marginal and non-strategic properties. Acquiring Properties To Which We Can Add Incremental Value. Generally, we seek to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by avoiding auction processes where we are competing with other buyers and timing our acquisitions to avoid the peak of the price cycle. Our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement, property consolidation and cash flow acceleration, thereby facilitating asset growth and debt reduction. During the past decade, we have consistently succeeded in adding value to acquired properties through this strategy. We made acquisitions totaling $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion and approximately $355 million, and acquired proved reserves of 253.8 MMboe, 212.6 MMboe and approximately 50 MMboe, in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the current environment is favorable for possible additional acquisitions. We continue to evaluate attractive opportunities. Any future acquisitions would be subject to a S-1
number of conditions, including conditions beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will enter into or actually consummate any such transactions. Investing In High-Potential Exploration Prospects. Our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long-term growth strategy. They complement our North American operations, which are more development oriented. We seek to concentrate our exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become a dominant operator in those regions. We believe that these investments, although higher-risk, offer the potential for significant reserve additions. A critical component in implementing our three-pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility. We are committed to preserving a strong balance sheet and credit position to give us the foundation required to pursue our growth initiatives. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Pending Transactions with BP p.l.c. On January 11, 2003, we signed two purchase and sales agreements with subsidiaries of BP p.l.c., which we refer to collectively as "BP," to purchase their interests in 61 producing fields, including 113 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and two producing fields in the North Sea. We will operate 36 of the producing fields in the Gulf of Mexico and both of the producing fields in the North Sea. Each of the purchase agreements is effective as of January 1, 2003. We anticipate the purchase of the Gulf of Mexico properties will close late in the first quarter of 2003, and the purchase of the North Sea properties will close late in the second quarter of 2003. The total purchase price for all of the assets being acquired is $1.3 billion, with $670 million allocated to the purchase of the Gulf of Mexico assets and $630 million allocated to the North Sea assets. The actual price payable upon the closing of each purchase will be reduced by the net cash flow attributable to the acquired fields, and increased by interest on the purchase price, from January 1, 2003, until the date of closing. The purchase price will also be subject to customary closing adjustments. Owners of working interests in certain Gulf of Mexico properties have preferential purchase rights which, if exercised, would reduce the interests we purchase in those properties and the purchase price we would pay. Neither acquisition is conditional upon the consummation of the other acquisition. The properties we are acquiring from BP in the Gulf of Mexico complement our extensive existing reserves and production in the Gulf, while the North Sea properties establish a new core area for us. Of the Gulf of Mexico properties we will acquire, most of the working interests exceed 50 percent, 19 of the fields are owned 100 percent and approximately 70 percent of the production will be operated by us. We are acquiring a 96 percent working interest in, and will be the operator of, the North Sea properties. We estimate that the properties we will acquire in the BP transactions had proved reserves as of January 1, 2003 of: -- 186.5 MMbbls of crude oil and natural gas liquids; and -- 279.9 Bcf of natural gas. Using the conventional equivalence of one barrel of oil to six Mcf of gas, these estimated proved reserves totaled 233.2 MMboe and were approximately 80 percent oil and 20 percent gas. Approximately 93 percent of these estimated proved reserves are developed reserves. We also estimate that 21 percent of the total oil reserves and 100 percent of the reserves of natural gas are in the Gulf of Mexico properties. The 2003 production estimates used to value the acquisition were: -- 65.5 Mbbls per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids; and -- 197.6 MMcf per day of natural gas. S-2
The estimates mentioned in the preceding three paragraphs are based on our analysis of historical production data, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines. The reserves and average daily production attributable to the BP transactions are based solely on our internal estimates and have not been reviewed by our independent reserve engineers. There is no assurance that the BP transactions will be completed or, if completed, that our estimates of reserves and average daily production will prove correct. In order to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices, we hedged 40.8 MMbbls of oil at an average price of $24.78 per Bbl and 70 Bcf of natural gas at an average price of $4.55 per MMbtu through 2004. We have agreed to sell all of the North Sea production from those properties over the next two years to BP at a combination of fixed and market sensitive prices pursuant to a contract entered into in connection with the North Sea purchase agreement. The fixed price portion of our contract with BP is included in the 40.8 MMbbl oil hedge. The BP transactions have received all necessary corporate approvals, and are not conditioned upon financing, but are subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and, in the case of the North Sea properties, U.K. regulatory and other approvals. Completed Acquisitions. A significant part of our growth strategy is to increase oil and gas reserves, production and cash flow through an active acquisition program. Apache has consummated several acquisitions since January 1, 2002. In December 2002, Apache completed the acquisition of certain South Louisiana properties comprising 234,000 net acres (366 square miles) with estimated net proved reserves of 30 MMboe, 88 percent of which is estimated to be natural gas, for approximately $260 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments. The acquisition also includes 135 producing wells and access to 849 square miles of 3-D seismic data covering the relatively contiguous acreage position. Based on our analysis of historical production rates, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines, we anticipate 2003 net daily production to approximate 55 MMcf of natural gas and 2,100 barrels of oil. We also entered into a separate exploration joint venture with the seller whereby the seller will actively generate prospects on certain South Louisiana acreage for a total cost of $25 million over a two year period. We have also completed several smaller acquisitions since January 1, 2002, for an aggregate of approximately $95 million. Together, these acquisitions include proved reserves of approximately 20 MMboe. 2002 Drilling Results. During 2002, we completed 1,018 gross wells as producers out of a total of 1,089 gross wells drilled. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we announced our fourth deep water discovery on our West Mediterranean concession offshore Egypt, and a new discovery in our Ras El Hekma concession in Egypt. These wells were, respectively, the 10th and 11th discoveries for us in Egypt and our 15th and 16th discoveries worldwide for the year. ------------------------ Our executive offices are located at 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056, and our telephone number is (713) 296-6000.

SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA We have provided in the tables below our selected financial and operating data. The financial information for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, and at December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, has been derived from our audited financial statements. The financial information for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2002, and at September 30, 2001 and 2002, has been derived from our unaudited financial statements. In our management's opinion, these unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements except as noted below. You should read the following financial information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that we have incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus. - ------------ (1) Includes the results of the acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties from Petsec Energy Inc., Shell Offshore Inc. and affiliated Shell entities, British-Borneo Oil & Gas Plc and Shell Canada Limited after February 1, 1999, May 18, 1999, June 18, 1999 and November 30, 1999, respectively. (2) Includes the results of the acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties from Repsol, Collins & Ware, Occidental and Phillips after January 24, 2000, June 30, 2000, August 17, 2000, and December 29, 2000, respectively. (3) Includes the results of the acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties from Repsol YPF and Fletcher Challenge Energy after March 22, 2001, and March 27, 2001, respectively. (4) As a result of the consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-10, "Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, third party gathering and transportation costs in the amount of $27.5 million have been reported as an operating expense instead of a reduction to revenues as previously reported. A reclassification has been made to reflect this change for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, resulting in an increase in reported revenue and operating expense for that period of $24.1 million. The change has no impact on income attributable to common stock. The income statement data for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, do not reflect the reclassification and report third party gathering and transportation costs as a reduction of revenues. For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the reclassification would result in an increase in reported revenue and operating expense of $15.1 million, $18.1 million and $32.3 million, respectively, with no impact on income attributable to common stock. S-5
(5) Does not take into account the 5 percent common stock dividend declared in December 2002. If the effects of the dividend had been taken into account, Net income per common share -- Basic would have been $1.50, $5.09 and $4.89 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and $4.37 and $2.47 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively. (6) Does not take into account the 5 percent stock common dividend declared in December 2002. If the effects of the dividend had been taken into account, Net income per common share -- Diluted would have been $1.49, $4.91 and $4.73 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and $4.22 and $2.43 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively. (7) Does not take into account the 5 percent common stock dividend declared in December 2002. If the effects of the dividend had been taken into account, Cash dividends per common share would have been $.24, $.18 and $.33 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and $.24 and $.29 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively. (8) Does not take into account the 5 percent common stock dividend declared in December 2002. If the effects of the dividend had been taken into account, common shares outstanding would have been 131,665,916 shares, 142,798,134 shares and 143,958,338 shares for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and 143,944,787 shares and 151,165,049 shares for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively. - ------------ (1) Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. (2) 6 Mcf of natural gas = 1 Boe. (3) Total reserve additions for the period, including revisions and net of property sales, divided by annual production. (4) Total proved reserves at period end divided by annual production.

RISK FACTORS Before making an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. In addition, please read "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this prospectus supplement, where we describe additional uncertainties associated with our business and the forward-looking statements included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. REPERCUSSIONS FROM THE TERRORIST ACTS COMMITTED IN THE UNITED STATES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS AND TO FULFILL OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND THE ACCOMPANYING PROSPECTUS. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, have caused instability in the world's markets. There can be no assurance that the current armed hostilities will not escalate or that these terrorist attacks, or the United States' responses to them, will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the United States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to the economic instability in the United States and the other regions in which we operate. Armed conflict, civil unrest, additional terrorist activities and the attendant political instability and societal disruption may reduce demand for our products or disrupt our ability to conduct our exploration, production, development and marketing activities, which could harm our business. OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE VOLATILE. VOLATILITY IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS AND THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THIS VOLATILITY ALSO MAKES VALUATION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES DIFFICULT AND CAN DISRUPT MARKETS. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, worldwide economic conditions, weather conditions, import prices, political conditions in major oil producing regions, especially the Middle East, and actions taken by OPEC. The prices for oil and natural gas could be significantly affected by the prospect and outcome of war in Iraq, for example. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of variations in oil and natural gas prices and production performance. In recent years, oil and natural gas price volatility has become increasingly severe. You can expect the market price of our common stock to decline when our quarterly results decline or at any time when events actually or potentially adverse to us or the industry occur. Our common stock price may decline to a price below the price you paid to purchase your shares of common stock in this offering. This volatility makes it difficult to estimate with precision the value of producing properties in acquisitions and to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving our oil and gas properties. In addition, unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and gas properties, as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties. A SUBSTANTIAL OR EXTENDED DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, quantities of oil and gas that may be economically produced, and access to capital. A significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would negatively affect us in several ways: -- our cash flow would be reduced, decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production; -- certain reserves would no longer be economic to produce, leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flow; and S-7
-- access to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable. Consequently, our revenues and profitability would suffer. OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE SERVICES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION AND PROCESSING. The sale of our oil and gas production, particularly outside of North America, depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. WE HAVE RECORDED WRITE-DOWNS BECAUSE OF FULL COST ACCOUNTING RULES AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO DO SO AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. Under the full cost accounting rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties--net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization, and deferred income taxes--may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, discounted at 10 percent, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, net of related tax effects. These rules generally require pricing future oil and gas production at the unescalated oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter. They also require a write-down if the "ceiling" is exceeded, even if prices declined for only a short period of time. If oil and gas prices fall significantly, a write-down may occur. Write-downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities. THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES DATA WE REPORT ARE ONLY ESTIMATES AND MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves of any category and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, which underlie the reserve estimates, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve data represent only estimates. In addition, the estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time. Any significant variance from the assumptions could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flows from them being materially different from the estimates. In addition, our estimated reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices, operating and development costs and other factors. At December 31, 2001, approximately 24 percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, which may not occur. IF WE FAIL TO ACQUIRE OR FIND ADDITIONAL RESERVES, OUR RESERVES AND PRODUCTION WILL DECLINE MATERIALLY FROM THEIR CURRENT LEVELS. The rate of production from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities, successfully apply new technologies or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. Future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves. S-8
WE INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, ESPECIALLY REGULATIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AND COULD INCUR EVEN GREATER COSTS IN THE FUTURE. Our exploration, production, development and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels, as well as by other countries in which we do business. We have made and will continue to make large expenditures in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations. Further, the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs. Hydrocarbon-producing states regulate conservation practices and the protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons we may produce and sell. In addition, at the U.S. federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates interstate transportation of natural gas under the Natural Gas Act. Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of royalty payments. As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could hurt our business. One of the responsibilities of owning and operating oil and gas properties is paying for the cost of abandonment. Upon closing of our acquisition of the North Sea properties, we have agreed to assume BP's abandonment obligation for those properties, the cost of which we took into consideration in determining the purchase price. Effective January 1, 2003, exploration and production companies are required to reflect abandonment costs as a liability on their balance sheets. Our purchase of the North Sea properties does not relieve BP of its liabilities if we do not satisfy our abandonment obligation. To ensure our payment of those costs, we have agreed to deliver a letter of credit to BP if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the North Sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change. If we are obligated to provide a letter of credit, it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED BY COMPETITION WITH OTHER COMPANIES. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and our business could be harmed by competition with other companies. Because oil and gas are fungible commodities, our principal form of competition is price competition. We strive to maintain the lowest finding and production costs possible to maximize profits. In addition, as an independent oil and gas company, we frequently compete for reserve acquisitions, exploration leases, licenses, concessions and marketing agreements against companies with financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess. Many of our competitors have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. WE DO NOT INSURE AGAINST ALL POTENTIAL LOSSES AND COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED BY UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES. Exploration for and production of oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts, cratering, fires and loss of well control, which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities, injure or kill people, and damage property and the environment. We maintain insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent. However, our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks. S-9
OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY PREVENT US FROM BENEFITING FROM PRICE INCREASES AND MAY EXPOSE US TO OTHER RISKS. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. In addition, we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations, particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver oil and gas volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed. THE PENDING BP TRANSACTIONS MIGHT NOT BE CONSUMMATED AS EXPECTED. The BP transactions have received all necessary corporate approvals and are not conditioned upon financing, but are subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and, in the case of the North Sea properties, U.K. regulatory and other approvals. We expect to satisfy those remaining conditions. Owners of other working interests in certain of the Gulf of Mexico properties have preferential rights to purchase portions of the interests we expect to acquire from BP that, if exercised, would reduce the interests we purchase in those fields and the purchase price we would pay. While we expect that the BP transactions will be closed and funded, we cannot be sure that the transactions will be completed. WHEN WE ACQUIRE OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, SUCH AS THOSE FROM BP, OUR FAILURE TO FULLY IDENTIFY AND CORRECTLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, TO PROPERLY ESTIMATE RESERVES OR PRODUCTION RATES OR COSTS, OR TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS COULD SERIOUSLY HARM US. We are actively engaged in acquiring oil and gas properties. When we acquire properties, such as those from BP, our failure to fully identify potential problems, to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could seriously harm us. Although we perform reviews of acquired properties and applicable records and contracts that we believe are consistent with industry practices, we do not review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily we focus on higher-value properties and sample the remainder. However, even a detailed review of properties and applicable records and contracts may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Our review may not sufficiently identify or evaluate applicable contracts under which third parties may assert preferential rights to purchase some of the properties that we believe we have acquired, rights to change or contest the operatorship of acquired properties, or rights with respect to acquired properties under agreements providing for areas of mutual interest. Even when we identify such third party rights, we may not correctly evaluate their applicability or potential consequences because of uncertain legal standards and for other reasons. Even when problems are identified, we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties. Actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. In addition, acquisitions may have adverse effects on our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations. OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. Our non-U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to: -- political and economic uncertainties, including, among others, changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in governmental energy policies or the personnel administering them; -- expropriation of property; S-10
-- cancellation or modification of contract rights; -- foreign exchange restrictions; -- currency fluctuations; -- risks of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities and insurrection; -- royalty and tax increases; and -- other risks arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted. These risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct these activities. Consequently, our non-U.S. exploration, development and production activities may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from our non-U.S. operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the United States or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States, which could adversely affect the outcome of the dispute. A DECLINE IN THE CONDITION OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR A SUBSTANTIAL RISE IN INTEREST RATES COULD HARM US. If the condition of the capital markets utilized by us to finance our operations materially declines, we might not be able to finance our operations on terms we consider acceptable. In addition, a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows. ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATES WITH SOME FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD HARM US. Our cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. Australian gas production is sold under fixed-price Australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in Australian dollars. Revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in Australian dollars are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate on the transaction date. Reported cash flow relating to Canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in Canadian dollars converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on the average of the Canadian and U.S. dollar exchange rates for the period reported. Substantially all of our international transactions, outside of Canada and Australia, are denominated in U.S. dollars. A decrease in value of 10 percent in the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and Polish zloty relative to the U.S. dollar from the September 30, 2002 exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately $16.0 million, based on September 30, 2002 amounts. The U.S. and Canadian energy markets continue to evolve into a single energy market. In light of this continuing transformation, we adopted the U.S. dollar as our functional currency in Canada, effective October 1, 2002. The U.S. dollar is now the functional currency for all our foreign operations. SUBSTANTIAL SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE. If our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock could significantly decline. All of the shares offered by this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws unless purchased by an "affiliate," as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. The outstanding shares subject to lock-up agreements between certain of our directors and executive officers and the underwriters may be sold 90 days after the effective date of this offering, except as noted in "Underwriting." S-11
OUR STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN, CHARTER, BYLAWS, DELAWARE LAW AND OUR DEBT SECURITIES DISCOURAGE UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER PROPOSALS AND COULD PREVENT YOU FROM REALIZING A PREMIUM FOR YOUR COMMON STOCK. We have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, our charter, bylaws, Delaware law and our debt securities contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. The stockholder rights plan and these provisions are described in "Description of Capital Stock--Stockholder Rights Plan" beginning on page 11 of the accompanying prospectus, and in "--Anti-Takeover Effect of Provisions of Apache's Charter and Bylaws and Delaware Law" beginning on page 13 of the accompanying prospectus. Our obligation to purchase our debt securities upon a change in control is described in "Description of Debt Securities--We Are Obligated to Purchase Debt Securities Upon a Change in Control" beginning on page 27 of the accompanying prospectus. Together these provisions and the stockholder rights plan may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for your common stock. INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN, RECOVERIES FROM ARTHUR ANDERSEN WITH RESPECT TO ITS AUDITS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. On March 14, 2002, our previous independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the federal government's investigation of Enron Corp. On June 15, 2002, a jury returned with a guilty verdict against Arthur Andersen following a trial. As a public company, we are required to file with the SEC periodic financial statements audited or reviewed by an independent public accountant. On March 29, 2002, we decided not to engage Arthur Andersen as our independent auditors, and engaged Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our new independent auditors for 2002. However, we are incorporating in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus financial statements for 2001, 2000 and 1999 that were audited by Arthur Andersen. Investors in our securities may encounter difficulties in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, from Arthur Andersen with respect to its audits of our financial statements relief that may be available to investors under the federal securities laws against auditing firms. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus, and the documents incorporated herein and therein by reference contain statements that constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including, without limitation, those relating to our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve information, projected levels of production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "believe" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe our expectations reflected in forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to have been correct. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements include, among others: -- the market prices of oil and gas; -- uncertainty of drilling results, reserve estimates and reserve replacement; -- operating uncertainties and hazards; -- economic and competitive conditions; S-12
-- natural disasters and other changes in business conditions; -- inflation rates; -- legislative and regulatory changes; -- financial market conditions; -- accuracy, completeness and veracity of information received from BP; -- wars and acts of terrorism or sabotage; -- political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments; and -- future business decisions. Additional factors are discussed under "Risk Factors" beginning on page S-7 of this prospectus supplement. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by our forward-looking statements might not occur. We undertake no obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate the net proceeds from the offering of common stock to be approximately $337.5 million, or $388.2 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, assuming an offering price of $56.60 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses of the offering payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, net cash generated from operations and short-term and long-term borrowings, to fund the cash requirements of the pending BP transactions. Pending such use, we will use the net proceeds of the offering to repay indebtedness under our commercial paper facilities and our money market lines of credit in the ordinary course of our business or to make short-term investments. The amount of repayment of indebtedness will depend, in part, on the closing of the BP transactions. We will use any net proceeds not used to finance the BP transactions for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2002, we had $271.4 million face amount of commercial paper discounted at an average weighted rate of 1.35 percent per annum and $8.9 million principal amount outstanding under our money market lines of credit bearing interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 15 basis points. S-13
CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2002, our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization on: -- an actual basis; and -- an as adjusted basis giving effect to our receipt of the estimated net proceeds from the sale of the shares we are selling in the offering and the application of the net proceeds pending the closing of the BP transactions. The as adjusted cash and cash equivalents and capitalization amounts assume that the over-allotment option is not exercised. The as adjusted amounts do not reflect the effects of our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002, which are not material to our capitalization, or the financing of the pending BP transactions. The as adjusted amounts are based on a common stock per share price of $56.60, which was the last reported sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on January 10, 2003. The table should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. S-14
PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK Our common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange under the symbol "APA." The following table sets forth on a per share basis the high and low sales prices for our common stock for the quarters indicated. Prices shown are from the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions Reporting System. On January 10, 2003, the last reported sale price for our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $56.60 per share. Stockholders should obtain current market quotations before making any decision with respect to an investment in our common stock. At December 31, 2002, there were 144,050,678 shares of our common stock outstanding, held by approximately 9,000 shareholders of record. Prices shown and shares outstanding exclude the shares issuable as a result of the 5 percent stock dividend declared on December 18, 2002. DIVIDEND POLICY We have paid cash dividends on our common stock for 36 consecutive years through December 31, 2002. We increased the annual stock dividend to $.40 per share in 2002. On December 18, 2002, we declared a special 5 percent common stock dividend to be paid on April 2, 2003, to stockholders of record on March 12, 2003. We also declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $.10 per share to be paid on February 21, 2003, to stockholders of record on January 22, 2003. Although we expect to continue the payment of dividends at that level, future dividend payments will depend upon our level of earnings, financial requirements and other relevant factors. In December 1995, we declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each share of our common stock outstanding on January 31, 1996 or issued after that date. These rights are more fully described on pages 11 and 12 of the accompanying prospectus. S-15
MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences expected to result under current law from the purchase, ownership and taxable disposition of common stock by non-U.S. holders of common stock. A "non-U.S. holder" is any person or entity other than one who is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: -- a citizen or resident of the United States; -- a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; -- an estate, the income of which is includable in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or -- a trust whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more U.S. persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. This summary does not address all of the U.S. federal income and estate tax considerations that may be relevant to non-U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances, such as a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person, or to non-U.S. holders that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary does not discuss any aspect of state, local or foreign taxation. This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations, judicial opinions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service and other applicable authorities, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. In this prospectus supplement, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, is called the "Code." Prospective purchasers of common stock are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of common stock. DIVIDENDS Apache pays cash dividends on its common stock. Any dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder on shares of common stock will be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30 percent, unless a lower rate is prescribed under an applicable tax treaty. U.S. federal income tax withholding will not be required, however, if the dividends are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder within the United States or, in the case of an applicable tax treaty, are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder. Dividends that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, or are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis which is not collected by withholding provided the non-U.S. holder files the appropriate certification with Apache or its agent. Any dividends received by a foreign corporation that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States may also be subject to a "branch profits tax" at a rate of 30 percent or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty. For purposes of the withholding tax rules discussed above and for purposes of determining the applicability of a tax treaty rate under current Treasury Regulations, dividends paid to an address outside the United States will be presumed to be paid to a resident of the country of address, unless the payor has knowledge to the contrary. Under Treasury Regulations (referred to as "final regulations") that are effective for payments made after December 31, 2000, a non-U.S. holder of common stock who wishes to claim the benefit of a tax treaty rate is required to satisfy applicable certification and other requirements. In addition, under the final regulations, in the case of common stock held by a foreign partnership: -- the certification requirement is generally applied to the partners of the partnership; and -- the partnership is required to provide certain information, including a U.S. taxpayer identification number. S-16
A non-U.S. holder of common stock that is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. federal income tax withholding pursuant to a tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts currently withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service. SALE OR DISPOSITION OF COMMON STOCK A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of common stock so long as: -- the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder within the United States and, under an applicable tax treaty, is not attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder; -- in the case of a non-U.S. holder who is an individual and holds the common stock as a capital asset, either: -- such holder is not present in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable year of the disposition; or -- such holder does not have a "tax home" in the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes and such holder does not maintain an office or other fixed place of business in the United States to which such gain is attributable; -- such non-U.S. holder is not subject to tax pursuant to the provisions of U.S. federal income tax law applicable to certain U.S. expatriates; and -- the common stock continues to be "regularly traded on an established securities market" for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the non-U.S. holder has not held, directly or indirectly, at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of disposition (or, if shorter, the non-U.S. holder's holding period) more than five percent of the outstanding common stock. INFORMATION REPORTING AND BACKUP WITHHOLDING Apache must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to, and the tax withheld with respect to, each non-U.S. holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of these information returns may also be made available under the provisions of a treaty or information exchange agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Under current law, U.S. backup withholding tax, which is a withholding tax at the applicable statutory rate on certain payments to persons who fail to furnish the information required under U.S. information reporting requirements, generally will not apply to dividends paid on common stock to a non-U.S. holder at an address outside the United States unless the payor has knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person. However, under the final regulations, dividends paid on common stock after December 31, 2000, may be subject to backup withholding unless applicable certification requirements are satisfied. Payment of the proceeds from a sale of common stock to or through a U.S. office of a broker will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the owner certifies as to its status as a non-U.S. holder under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption. Payment of the proceeds from a sale of common stock to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker generally will not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, if such broker is a U.S. person, a "controlled foreign corporation" or a foreign person that derives 50 percent or more of its gross income from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, such payment will be subject to information reporting, but currently not backup withholding, unless such broker has documentary evidence in its records that the owner is a non-U.S. holder and certain other conditions are met or the owner otherwise establishes an exemption. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be credited against the non-U.S. holder's federal income tax liability, if any, or refunded, provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. S-17
ESTATE TAX The fair market value of common stock owned, or treated as owned, by an individual at the time of his death will be includable in his gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes and thus may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax, even though the individual at the time of death is neither a citizen of nor domiciled in the United States, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise. GROWTH AND JOBS PLAN PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT BUSH ON JANUARY 7, 2003 President George W. Bush recently proposed a new tax plan that, if enacted, would eliminate U.S. federal income tax on certain dividends paid on common stock by corporations that pay U.S. federal income tax. Under the proposal, dividends would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if (i) they are paid from profits earned by corporations in 2002 or later, and (ii) the corporation has paid U.S. federal income tax on such profits. As currently proposed, President Bush's plan, if enacted, would require us, upon payment of dividends, to inform shareholders of the amount of the dividend that would be "tax-free" under the plan. The current proposal does not include sufficient detail to permit us to determine what effect, if any, the proposal would have on the withholding requirements applicable to non-U.S. persons who own shares of our common stock. The proposal is preliminary in nature and must be reduced to legislation that will be proposed in Congress. There can be no assurance that the proposal will be enacted into law. S-18
UNDERWRITING Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in an underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus supplement, the underwriters named below, for whom Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is acting as the representative, have severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to them, severally, the number of shares of our common stock indicated below: The underwriters are offering the shares of common stock subject to their acceptance of the shares from us and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus supplement are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus supplement if any such shares are purchased. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the underwriters' over-allotment option described below. The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the shares of common stock directly to the public at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement and part to certain dealers at a price that represents a concession not in excess of $ a share under the public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares of our common stock, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the representatives. The following table shows public offering price, underwriting discount and proceeds before expenses to Apache. This information assumes either no exercise or full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. The expenses of this offering, not including the underwriting discount and commissions, are estimated at $265,000 and are payable by Apache. We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus supplement, to purchase up to an aggregate of 930,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the shares of common stock hereby. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase approximately the same percentage of the additional shares of common stock as the number listed next to the underwriter's name in the next preceding table bears to the total number of shares of common stock listed next to the name of all underwriters in the next preceding table. S-19
We and our directors and executive officers have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of the underwriters, we, he or she will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of this prospectus supplement: -- offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock or file any registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the foregoing; or -- enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the common stock; whether any transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. In addition, our directors and executive officers have agreed that, without the prior consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of the underwriters, they will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of this prospectus supplement, make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of our common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock. The restrictions described in the preceding paragraph do not apply to: -- the sale of shares to the underwriters pursuant to the underwriting agreement; -- transactions by any person other than us relating to shares of our common stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of this offering; -- any shares of common stock issued pursuant to our existing dividend reinvestment program; -- the grant of options or common stock under our stock and incentive plans as in effect at the date hereof or the issuance of shares of our common stock under our non-employee director stock plan or dividend reinvestment plan; -- the issuance by us of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of an option or a warrant or the conversion of a security outstanding on the date hereof and disclosed in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus; or -- the issuance by us of shares of our common stock in connection with a purchase of assets or other transaction described in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. In addition, the restrictions on our directors and executive officers do not apply to the sale of shares of common stock upon the exercise of options for less than 9,000 shares of common stock held by one of our executive officers under our stock and incentive plans, which options will expire within 90 days of the date of this prospectus supplement, or any transfer or disposition of common stock to Apache pursuant to a cashless exercise of an option to purchase common stock granted pursuant to a benefit plan and existing as of the date of this prospectus supplement. In order to facilitate the offering of the common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the over-allotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of shares compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell shares in excess of the over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. As an S-20
additional means of facilitating the offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of common stock in the open market to stabilize the price of the common stock. The underwriting syndicate may also reclaim selling concessions allowed to an underwriter or a dealer for distributing the common stock in the offering, if the syndicate repurchases previously distributed common stock to cover syndicate short positions or to stabilize the price of the common stock. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the common stock above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. In the ordinary course of their business, certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, or may in the future provide, investment banking and other financial services to us or our subsidiaries, including underwriting, the provision of financial advice and the extension of credit. These underwriters and their affiliates have received, and may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for their services. Morgan Stanley has performed investment banking and other financial services for Apache and has received compensation for these services, which included services to Apache in connection with the BP transactions. Salomon Smith Barney Inc. acted as co-arranger on the $1.5 billion global credit facility that we entered into on June 3, 2002. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against a variety of liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. LEGAL MATTERS Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, White, Williams & Martin, Houston, Texas, our outside legal counsel, and our Vice President and Associate General Counsel, Eric L. Harry, or our Attorney and Assistant Secretary, Jeffrey B. King, will issue opinions about some legal matters in connection with the offering.

EXHIBIT 99.3 CONTACTS (APACHE): (MEDIA): TONY LENTINI (713) 296-6227 BILL MINTZ (713) 296-7276 DAVID HIGGINS (713) 296-6690 (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713) 296-6662 (WEB SITE): www.apachecorp.com CONTACT (BP): CLARE BEBBINGTON 011 + 44 (20) 7496 4851 (WEB SITE): www.bp.com FOR RELEASE AT 6 A.M. CENTRAL TIME APACHE TO ACQUIRE BP PROPERTIES FOR $1.3 BILLION; LEGACY NORTH SEA AND GULF OF MEXICO ASSETS Houston, Jan. 13, 2003--Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) today announced agreements to acquire producing properties in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $1.3 billion. The acquisition adds an estimated 29 percent to Apache's 2002 production and 14 percent to its year-end 2002 assets on a pro forma basis. Apache's acquisition economics estimate net proved reserves of 233.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (20 percent natural gas) and 2003 average daily production of 198 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and 65,500 barrels of oil. "Establishing the North Sea as an Apache core area extends our relationship to one of the world's premier integrated major companies and the largest crude oil producer in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea," said Apache CEO and President G. Steven Farris. -more-
APACHE ACQUIRES ASSETS FROM BP - ADD 1 "In the Gulf of Mexico, where Apache generated approximately $450 million in net operating income last year, the transaction adds production and reserves and a new exploitation portfolio in North America's strongest gas market. "The North Sea fits our balanced-portfolio business model and provides the potential for future internal growth similar to what we have experienced in places like Egypt. Since increasing our Khalda Concession interest to 100 percent 22 months ago, we have grown gross liquids production from 42,400 barrels per day to 65,500 barrels per day," said Farris. "We made seven Western Desert exploration discoveries just last year, plus another four in the deepwater portion of our West Mediterranean Concession." Apache has a physical sale agreement with BP to take all of Apache's North Sea production for two years at a combination of fixed and floating prices. A substantial portion of the oil and gas production, both in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, has been hedged at favorable prices through 2004 to preserve Apache's strong financial position in a period of cyclically high gas and oil prices, to protect the acquisition economics, and to maintain Apache's position as a reliable purchaser of major companies' assets as they adjust their worldwide portfolios. Approximately two-thirds of the reserves and daily oil production Apache is acquiring from BP are in the North Sea's Forties oil field, establishing a new international operating region for Apache. Apache will become field operator with a 96 percent working interest. Discovered by BP in 1970, the Forties field is the largest ever found in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea and still ranks eighth in production and reserves after having produced approximately 2.5 billion barrels to date. Apache's acquisition economics estimate average 2003 production of 45,100 barrels of oil per day and net proved reserves of 147.6 million barrels. Apache's production will be transported via the Forties Pipeline System. -more-
APACHE ACQUIRES ASSETS FROM BP - ADD 2 The Gulf of Mexico properties are located offshore Texas and Louisiana in areas where Apache has substantial existing operations. The acquisition economics estimate 2003 production of 198 MMcf per day and 20,400 barrels of liquid hydrocarbons per day and net proved reserves totaling 85.6 million barrels equivalent. The assets comprise 113 total blocks and 61 fields; 70 percent of the production is operated. Apache will acquire a 100 percent working interest in 19 of the fields. The effective date of the transaction is Jan. 1, 2003, with closing on the Gulf portion anticipated on or about March 31 and the North Sea portion projected for late in the second quarter. Both closings are subject to customary government approvals. Apache intends to finance the acquisition with a combination of internally generated funds, equity and debt. Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser to Apache for this transaction. Apache Corporation is a large independent exploration and production company with existing operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, Western Australia, China, Argentina and Poland. Maps and other materials relating to the BP transaction are available on Apache's Web site at www.apachecorp.com. The Web site will simulcast Apache's conference call on the acquisition on Monday, January 13, at 9:30 a.m. Central time. By midday the conference call will be available for replay both online and via telephone (dial 719-457-0820 and provide pass code number 700962).
