EXHIBIT 23.1 CONSENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS We consent to the incorporation by reference in this Current Report on Form 8-K of our report dated March 14, 2003 with respect to the financial statements of Apache Corporation and subsidiaries included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP ERNST & YOUNG LLP Houston, Texas June ______, 2003

EXHIBIT 99.4 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Shareholders of Apache Corporation: We have audited the accompanying statement of combined revenues and direct operating expenses of the oil and gas properties purchased by Apache Corporation from BP p.l.c. for the year ended December 31, 2002. This financial statement is the responsibility of Apache Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this financial statement based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards, generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The accompanying statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in Apache Corporation's Form 8-K/A and is not intended to be a complete financial presentation of the properties described above. In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the combined revenues and direct operating expenses of the oil and gas properties purchased by Apache Corporation from BP p.l.c. for the year ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

STATEMENT OF COMBINED REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES PURCHASED BY APACHE CORPORATION FROM BP p.l.c. (IN THOUSANDS) The accompanying notes are an integral part of this financial statement. A-2
NOTES TO STATEMENT OF COMBINED REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES PURCHASED BY APACHE CORPORATION FROM BP p.l.c. (1) THE PROPERTIES On January 13, 2003, Apache Corporation (Apache) entered into an agreement to purchase producing properties in the U.K. North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, with estimated proved reserves of 233.2 MMboe, from BP p.l.c. (BP), for $1.3 billion, subject to normal closing adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2003. The Gulf of Mexico segment of the transaction closed March 13, 2003 and the North Sea segment closed April 2, 2003. (2) BASIS FOR PRESENTATION During the periods presented, the BP properties were not accounted for or operated as a separate division by BP. Certain costs, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, interest, accretion, general and administrative expenses, and corporate income taxes were not allocated to the individual properties. Accordingly, full separate financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles do not exist and are not practicable to obtain in these circumstances. Revenues and direct operating expenses included in the accompanying statement represent Apache's net working interest in the properties acquired for the periods prior to the respective closing dates and are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Depreciation, depletion and amortization, interest, accretion, general and administrative expenses and corporate income taxes have been excluded. The financial statements presented are not indicative of the results of operations of the acquired properties going forward due to changes in the business and inclusion of the above mentioned expenses. (3) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement between BP and Apache, any claims, litigation or disputes pending as of the effective date (January 1, 2003) or any matters arising in connection with ownership of the properties prior to the effective date are retained by BP. Notwithstanding this indemnification, Apache is not aware of any legal, environmental or other commitments or contingencies that would have a material effect on the statement of combined revenues and direct operating expenses. A-3
SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION Proved oil and gas reserve quantities are based on estimates prepared by the Company's engineers and from information provided by BP p.l.c., in accordance with guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The following reserve data represents estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. A-4
SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS INFORMATION - CONTINUED (UNAUDITED) FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS Future cash inflows are based on year-end oil and gas prices except in those instances where future natural gas or oil sales are covered by physical contract terms providing for higher or lower amounts. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Future income tax expense on the BP properties is based on Apache's purchase price allocation. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company's oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used. The following table sets forth the principal sources of change in discounted future net cash flows. A-5

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASIS OF PRESENTATION The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, is based on the audited financial statements of Apache for the year ended December 31, 2002, the audited statement of combined revenues and direct operating expenses for the BP properties for the year ended December 31, 2002, and the adjustments and assumptions described below. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2003, and the unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2003, are based on the unaudited financial statements of Apache as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2003, the unaudited statement of combined revenues and direct operating expenses for the BP properties for the three months ended March 31, 2003, and the adjustments and assumptions described below. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS REFLECT THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS: a. Record incremental depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, using the units-of-production method, resulting from the purchase of the BP properties. b. Record assumed increase in general and administrative expense as a result of the purchase of the BP properties. c. Record interest expense associated with debt of approximately $604 million incurred under Apache's global credit facility to fund a portion of the purchase price before consideration of purchase price adjustments. Applicable interest rates on the facility were 1.9 percent for 2002 and 1.3 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. d. Record capitalized interest, assuming $123 million of the purchase price is allocated to unproved oil and gas properties with the balance of the purchase price allocated to proved properties. Capitalized interest relating to unproved properties reflects a rate of 6.6 percent for 2002 and 7.1 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. e. Record a pro forma income tax provision, assuming a 35 percent rate for the Gulf of Mexico portion and 43 percent for the North Sea portion. f. Record the issuance of 9.9 million shares of Apache common stock to finance the acquisition. g. Record asset retirement obligation on properties acquired from BP. h. Record adjustment to reflect issuance of 9.9 million shares as of January 1, 2003. B-5

Record the purchase price for the BP properties, net of estimated purchase price adjustments totaling $95 million, funded with: o Cash and proceeds from additional borrowings of approximately $604 million. o Purchase price adjustments are subject to further review and audit. 2.

APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES PRO FORMA SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED) The following table sets forth certain unaudited pro forma information concerning Apache's proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2002, giving effect to the BP transaction as if it had occurred on January 1, 2002. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating the quantities of proved reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. The following reserve data represents estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES B-7
APACHE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES PRO FORMA SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES - (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED) The following table sets forth unaudited pro forma information concerning the discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves of Apache as of December 31, 2002, net of income tax expense, and giving effect to the acquisition of the BP properties as if it had occurred on January 1, 2002. Income tax expense has been computed using assumptions relating to the future tax rates and the permanent differences and credits under the tax laws relating to oil and gas activities at December 31, 2002. Cash flows relating to the BP properties are based on Apache's evaluation of reserves and on information provided by BP. Future income tax expense on the BP properties is based on Apache's purchase price allocation. The information should be viewed only as a form of standardized disclosure concerning possible future cash flows that would result under the assumptions used, but should not be viewed as indicative of fair market value. Reference is made to Apache's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, and the Statement of Combined Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses included herein, for a discussion of the assumptions used in preparing the information presented. The following table sets forth the principal sources of change in discounted future net cash flows: B-8
