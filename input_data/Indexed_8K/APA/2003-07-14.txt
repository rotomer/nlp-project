ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS On June 24, 2003, Apache Corporation issued a press release announcing that it will begin directly marketing its U.S. natural gas production, beginning with its July production. Apache also announced that Cinergy Marketing and Trading, LLC and Apache had terminated the marketing arrangement between the two companies and dismissed the arbitration pending between them. This news release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. On July 3, 2003, Apache announced that it had acquired producing properties on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico from Shell Exploration and Production Company for $200 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments, including adjustment for the exercise by third parties of preferential purchase rights. The properties were subject to a volumetric production payment, which was sold by Shell to Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. for $300 million. Accordingly, Apache will not report any of the volumes delivered to Morgan Stanley as reserves or production. Apache is recording a liability of approximately $60 million, representing the estimated costs to operate and deliver the production to Morgan Stanley. Apache will book proved reserves of 124.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and 6.6 million barrels of oil, (which is net of the 68.4 Bcf equivalent production payment as of the acquisition date). The news release announcing the acquisition is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this report. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (c) EXHIBITS. EXHIBIT NO.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACTS: - --------- (MEDIA): TONY LENTINI (713) 296-6227 BILL MINTZ (713) 296-7276 (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713) 296-6662 (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM FOR RELEASE AT 8 A.M. CENTRAL TIME ---------------------------------- APACHE TO EXPAND GAS MARKETING OPERATIONS Houston, June 24, 2003 - Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) today announced that it will begin directly marketing its U.S. natural gas production, beginning with its July production. The company has marketed its international oil and gas production, Canadian gas and North American liquid hydrocarbons for some time. Apache's U.S. natural gas production has been marketed by Cincinnati-based Cinergy for the last five years. Apache and Cinergy have agreed to terminate that relationship and also dismissed the arbitration pending between them. "Five years ago, Apache was producing around 500 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day in the United States and Canada and our arrangement with Cinergy made sense," said G. Steven Farris, chief executive officer and president. "Today, with more than 1 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of gas production in North America and significant changes in the gas marketing arena, it is time for Apache to market its own gas." -over-
APACHE MARKETING OPERATIONS--ADD 1 Including gas from other producers, Apache will market approximately 1.2 Bcf of gas per day in North America: approximately 830 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the United States and about 420 MMcf per day in Canada. The company has established an oil and gas marketing department headed by Janine McArdle, a corporate vice president with an extensive energy marketing background. "We've put together a great team and we are eager to get started," McArdle said. "We want to get closer to our customers and provide them with the services they need," McArdle said. "In this new era of gas marketing, we believe more direct interaction between producers and consumers is good for both ends of the energy chain." Apache Corporation is a large oil and gas independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea, and Australia. -end-

EXHIBIT 99.2 CONTACTS: - --------- (MEDIA): TONY LENTINI (713) 296-6227 BILL MINTZ (713) 296-7276 (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713) 296-6662 (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM FOR RELEASE AT 10:58 A.M. CENTRAL TIME APACHE BUYS GULF OF MEXICO SHELF PROPERTIES FROM SHELL FOR $200 MILLION Houston, July 3, 2003 - Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of producing properties on the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico from Shell Exploration and Production Company for $200 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments, including preferential rights. The acquisition includes 26 fields covering 50 blocks (approximately 209,000 acres) and interests in two onshore gas plants. Apache will operate 15 of the fields with 91 percent of the production. Apache will book proved reserves of 124.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and 6.6 million barrels of oil at a cost of approximately $1.22 per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent (Mcfe). Prior to the transaction, Morgan Stanley paid Shell $300 million to acquire an overriding royalty interest in a portion of the lower-risk reserves to be produced over the next four years. Apache acquired the remaining reserves at a low cost per Mcfe and retains all of the potential upside from future exploration and development activities. Apache's acquired production for the last six months of 2003 is expected to average 70.4 million cubic feet of gas and 4,600 barrels of oil per day. "We are pleased to have negotiated another mutually beneficial transaction with Shell," said Apache Chief Executive Officer and President G. Steven Farris. "These assets lay down well with our existing Gulf of Mexico properties. We will not have to add additional staff and we expect to create efficiencies in our field operations. The Gulf Coast enjoys the highest netback natural gas pricing in North America. With the current shortage of natural gas, we are hopeful of adding production to help bring on new supplies." -over-
APACHE GULF OF MEXICO ACQUISITION--1 Farris said, "These assets have been capital-constrained for several years. Just as with the Gulf of Mexico property package we purchased from Shell in May 1999, we plan to invest money to maximize production and add new reserves." In the May 1999 transaction, Apache paid Shell $716 million and has invested another $550 million in exploitation activities. "By year-end 2002, we had recouped 91 percent of our total investment and still had 74 percent of the proved reserves that we booked at the time of the acquisition," Farris said. "Morgan Stanley's acquisition of the high-value, low-risk barrels enables us to concentrate our capital and abilities on adding reserves and value to mature fields, an Apache core competence," Farris said. Shell's sale of an overriding royalty interest to Morgan Stanley is commonly known in the industry as a volumetric production payment. Under its terms, Morgan Stanley is to receive a fixed volume of 68.4 Bcf equivalent estimated to be produced over the next four years. These reserves will not be booked by Apache. Overriding royalties are not burdened by production costs and therefore Apache will record a $58 million liability for the future cost to produce and deliver these volumes to Morgan Stanley. These costs will be amortized as the volumes are produced. Apache Corporation is a large oil and gas independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, the UK North Sea, Egypt and Australia. -end- For more information about this transaction, please go to Apache's Web site, www.apachecorp.com.
