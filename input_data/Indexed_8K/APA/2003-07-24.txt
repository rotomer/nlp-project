ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (c) EXHIBITS. EXHIBIT NO. DESCRIPTION - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated July 24, 2003, "Apache Reports Record Second-Quarter Oil and Gas Production." ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Apache"), is furnishing this Current Report on Form 8-K to report information pursuant to Item 12 - Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of Form 8-K. On July 24, 2003, Apache issued a press release announcing results for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2003. The press release is listed and furnished under Item 7 as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations or "cash flow." Cash from operations represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from operations is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Cash from operations is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash from operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations.
The press release discusses Apache's earnings per share before non-cash adjustments, a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings per share before non-cash adjustments, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes items (such as the impact of currency fluctuations on deferred taxes) that management deems not representative of the Company's financial performance. Management believes this measure provides a clearer understanding of the Company's financial results and enables investors to better compare its results with those of other companies.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1 [APACHE LETTERHEAD] CONTACTS: (MEDIA): BILL MINTZ (713) 296-7276 TONY LENTINI (713) 296-6227 DAVID HIGGINS (713) 296-6690 (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713) 296-6662 (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM APACHE REPORTS RECORD SECOND-QUARTER OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION Houston, July 24, 2003 - Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) today reported that record production fueled second-quarter earnings of $243 million, or $1.49 per diluted common share, including the impact of a non-cash charge related to foreign currency fluctuations. Apache reported net income of $143 million, or 95 cents per share, in the prior-year period. Excluding the non-cash charge, Apache earned $288 million or $1.76 per diluted common share. (See below for reconciliation of this non-GAAP number.) The $45 million charge (27 cents per share) was the result of recognizing unrealized foreign currency gains and losses caused by the weakening U.S. dollar. Approximately one half of the non-cash charge was the result of a theoretical tax on a theoretical gain calculated as though Apache had prepaid the U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt of its Canadian subsidiaries in stronger Canadian dollars. As the company did not prepay the debt, nor realize a gain, nor incur a tax, Apache believes it should not record the charge. Although Apache recorded the charge in the second quarter, the company will seek to resolve this issue with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. -more-
APACHE REPORTS RECORD PRODUCTION - ADD ONE Oil production rose nearly 40 percent to 211,701 barrels per day in the second quarter, compared with 151,480 barrels per day in the year-earlier period. Natural gas production averaged 1.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up 15 percent from 1.1 Bcf per day in the prior-year period. Natural gas liquids production averaged 9,342 barrels per day, up from 8,483 barrels per day in the prior-year period. Cash from operations increased to $639 million from $388 million in the prior-year period. (Please see below for a reconciliation of Apache's calculation of cash from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure.) For the six months ended June 30, Apache earned net income of $580 million, or $3.59 per diluted share, including $56 million, or 34 cents per share, in non-cash charges related to foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the non-cash charges, Apache earned $636 million, or $3.93 per share, in the first half. Apache earned $219 million, or $1.47 per share, in the first half of 2002. First-half cash from operations increased to $1.3 billion from $677 million in the prior-year period. "Record production was just part of the story behind Apache's second-quarter results," said G. Steven Farris, president and chief executive officer. "We had significant drilling successes and we have completed $1.5 billion in acquisitions year-to-date, the impact of which will be reflected in future quarters." Early in the second quarter, Apache completed its two-part acquisition of BP assets in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. On July 2, Apache announced an additional acquisition of fields in the Gulf from Shell Exploration and Production Company. "We also maintained our financial flexibility, with a lower debt-to-capitalization ratio than at the beginning of the year, even with the acquisitions," Farris said. -more-
APACHE REPORTS RECORD PRODUCTION - ADD TWO Apache recently announced several significant discoveries, three of which opened new plays: o The Qasr-1X tested at a combined rate of 51.8 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and 2,688 barrels of condensate per day from two zones and logged 606 feet of net pay from six formations. "We believe the Qasr-1X, in Egypt's Khalda Concession, is the most significant Western Desert discovery in the last decade, as it opens a new play over widespread acreage," Farris said. o On the Matruh Concession in Egypt, Apache drilled the Alexandrite-1X wildcat to 15,300 feet in the Jurassic Lower Safa formation. The well logged 146 net feet of gas and condensate pay; a test of the Kabrit interval flowed at a daily rate of 20 MMcf and 1,683 barrels of condensate. "These discoveries are important for Apache and for Egypt because the country shares in the economic benefit associated with finding oil and gas to meet its energy needs," Farris said. o In early July, Apache's Ravensworth-1 well discovered oil in the Exmouth Sub-Basin offshore Western Australia. "This discovery is the most important well we've drilled in Australia this year," Farris said. Apache Corporation is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Western Australia. -end- This news release contains certain "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding Apache's capital expenditures and future production. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are delays and difficulties in completing acquisitions and developing currently owned properties, the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells, delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, general economic conditions and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Apache's periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NOTE: Apache will conduct its quarterly conference call to discuss second quarter results on Thursday, July 24, at 1 p.m. Central Time. The call will be webcast live on Apache's Web site, www.apachecorp.com. The conference call will be available for delayed playback by telephone for one week beginning at approximately 5 p.m. on July 25. To access the telephone playback, dial (719) 457-0820 and provide Apache's confirmation code, 624896.
