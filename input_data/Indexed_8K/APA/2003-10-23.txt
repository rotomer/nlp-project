ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS (c) EXHIBITS. EXHIBIT NO. DESCRIPTION - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release dated October 23, 2003, "Apache Third Quarter Earnings of $1.69 per Share Fueled by Record Oil and Gas Production, Strong Prices" ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION On October 23, 2003, Apache issued a press release announcing results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2003. The press release is listed and furnished under Item 7 as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations or "cash flow." Cash from operations represents net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash from operations is presented because management believes it is a useful adjunct to net cash provided by operating activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Cash from operations is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company's ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Cash from operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities, as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations. The press release discusses Apache's earnings per share before non-cash adjustments, a non-GAAP financial measure. Earnings per share before non-cash adjustments, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of currency fluctuations (FX) on deferred taxes that management deems not representative of the Company's financial performance. Management believes this measure provides a clearer understanding of the Company's financial results and enables investors to better compare its results with those of other companies.
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1 [APACHE LETTERHEAD] CONTACTS: (MEDIA): BILL MINTZ (713) 296-7276 TONY LENTINI (713) 296-6227 DAVID HIGGINS (713) 296-6690 (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713) 296-6662 (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM FOR RELEASE AT 8 A.M. CENTRAL TIME APACHE THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS OF $1.69 PER SHARE FUELED BY RECORD OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, STRONG PRICES Houston, Oct. 23, 2003 - Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) today reported that record production and continued strong commodity prices fueled third-quarter earnings of $276 million, or $1.69 per diluted common share, compared with $145 million, or 95 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Absent the impact of non-cash foreign currency fluctuations on deferred taxes, Apache would have earned $1.81 per share. Apache produced 449,034 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day in the third quarter, up 34 percent from the year-earlier period and a 5 percent increase from the second quarter of 2003. Cash from operations was a record $730 million, up 81 percent from the year-earlier period and a 14 percent increase from the second quarter of 2003. (Please see below for Apache's calculations of cash from operations and earnings excluding the impact of non-cash foreign currency fluctuations, which are non-GAAP measures.) Oil production rose 51 percent to 228,698 barrels per day in the third quarter, compared with 151,143 barrels per day in the year-earlier period. Natural gas production averaged 1.26 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up 19 percent from 1.06 Bcf per day in the prior-year period. Natural gas liquids production averaged 9,686 barrels per day, up from 8,081 barrels per day in the prior-year period. -more-
APACHE THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS OF $1.69 PER SHARE - ADD ONE In the first nine months of 2003, Apache earned $856 million, or $5.27 per diluted share, surpassing the full-year record of $704 million set in 2001. Apache's cash from operations for the nine months exceeded $2 billion, more than the previous full-year record of $1.9 billion set in 2001. "Since the beginning of the year, Apache's production has increased by one-third, largely as a result of strategic acquisitions in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico but also as a result of our very successful drilling program," said G. Steven Farris, president and chief executive officer. "Exploration success in Egypt and Australia has added future production potential in both of those core areas. "During the third quarter, we increased production, completed a $200 million acquisition and still ended the period with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 28.5 percent," Farris said. Apache marked additional significant progress on the operational and financial fronts during the third quarter: o Production commenced in China. The Zhao Dong field is currently producing approximately 16,000 barrels per day. Apache has a 24.5 percent interest in the field but its share of production is approximately 60 percent until capital and carried funds are recovered. o Apache made two oil discoveries in Western Australia's offshore Exmouth Sub-Basin. Apache has a 28.57 percent working interest in Crosby-1 discovery and a 31.501 percent interest in the Ravensworth-1 discovery. o Apache completed its acquisition of fields in the Gulf of Mexico from Shell Exploration and Production Company. Thus far in 2003, Apache has completed $1.5 billion in acquisitions. Apache Corporation is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Western Australia. -more-

This news release contains certain "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding Apache's future production. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are delays and difficulties in completing acquisitions and developing currently owned properties, the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells, delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, general economic conditions and the risk factors detailed from time to time in Apache's periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. -end-
