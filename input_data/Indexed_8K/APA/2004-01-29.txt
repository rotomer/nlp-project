Exhibit 99.1 CONTACTS: (MEDIA): TONY LENTINI (713) 296-6227) DAVID HIGGINS (713) 296-6690) (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713) 296-6662 (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM FOR RELEASE AT 8:00 A.M. CENTRAL TIME APACHE EARNINGS CROSS BILLION-DOLLAR MILESTONE FULL-YEAR RESULTS BOOSTED BY STRONG COMMODITY PRICES, RECORD PRODUCTION AND DRILLING RESULTS Houston (Jan. 29, 2004) - Apache Corporation (NYSE, NASDAQ: APA) today reported full-year 2003 earnings of $1.1 billion, or $3.43 per diluted common share, on strong commodity prices and record production, up 105 percent from $544 million, or $1.80 per share in 2002. All per-share amounts in this release reflect the recent two-for-one stock split. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below) totaled $2.8 billion in 2003, up 79 percent from $1.6 billion in 2002. Apache's fourth-quarter net income of $260 million, or 80 cents per share, was 45 percent above net income of $179 million, or 59 cents per share, in 2002. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities (non-GAAP; see reconciliation below) grew 69 percent to $786 million. Absent the impact of non-cash deferred tax expenses resulting from the erosion of the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a reduction in Canadian tax rates, Apache would have earned $1.2 billion or $3.74 per share for the full year and $284 million or 87 cents per share in the fourth quarter. (Non-GAAP; see reconciliation below.) -more-
APACHE EARNINGS SURPASS $1 BILLION--ADD 1 "Strong commodity prices are only part of the story of our 2003 record results," said G. Steven Farris, president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. "In addition to earning over $1 billion--our best year ever--production increased 22 percent and worldwide reserves increased 26 percent. We replaced 330 percent of our production through a combination of strategic acquisitions and outstanding drilling success at an all-in 2003 finding cost of $6.07 per barrel of oil equivalent. In a year in which we added over half a billion barrels of oil equivalent on $3 billion of investments, Apache reduced its debt to 26 percent of capitalization." Among the financial and operational highlights for 2003: o Apache ended the year with proved reserves of 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), marking the 18th consecutive year of reserve growth; o Production averaged a record 417,400 boe per day, the 24th year of production increases in the last 25 years; o Apache added 234 million boe of proved reserves (154 percent of 2003 production) through exploration and development activities--one of the company's best drilling performances ever; o Another 267 million boe were added through acquisitions, including the company's strategic entree into the North Sea; and o Apache commenced production from the Zhao Dong block in Bohai Bay, China. "We had outstanding exploration success in Egypt and Western Australia last year that will help drive production and financial results in the future," Farris said. Apache's fourth-quarter production averaged 441,400 boe per day, compared with 338,300 boe per day in the prior-year period. Liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 231,400 -more-
APACHE EARNINGS SURPASS $1 BILLION--ADD 2 barrels per day, up 45 percent from the prior-year period, while natural gas production averaged 1.26 billion cubic feet per day, up 17 percent. Apache's results include the fourth-quarter after-tax write-down of $10.2 million reflecting remaining costs associated with the termination of operations in Poland. The impairment reduced full-year earnings by 3 cents per diluted common share. Apache Corporation is a large oil and gas independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Western Australia. NOTE: Apache will conduct its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth-quarter and full-year results on Thursday, Jan. 29, at 1 p.m. Central Time. The call will be webcast live and posted on Apache's Web site, www.apachecorp.com. The conference call will be available for delayed playback by telephone for one week beginning at approximately 5 p.m. on Jan 29. To access the telephone playback, dial (719) 457-0820 and provide Apache's confirmation code, 516142. This news release contains certain "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, without limitation, expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding production and financial results. Any matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking and, accordingly, involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. There is no assurance that Apache's expectations will be realized, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. -end-
APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands, except per share data)
APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands, except per share data) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. It is presented because management believes the information is useful for investors because it is used internally and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies, and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity, but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. Earnings and earnings per share absent non-cash deferred tax impacts, a non-GAAP measure, exclude certain tax items that management believes distort the Company's results of operations. These items relate to deferred tax expense resulting from currency fluctuations and the effects of a tax rate reduction in Canada. Management believes that, during periods of volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign tax rates, the exclusion of these items from earnings and earnings per share provides a more representative report of the Company's financial performance and will enable investors to better compare our results with other companies by eliminating items that have distinctive effects on the Company.
