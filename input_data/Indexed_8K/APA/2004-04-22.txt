EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACTS: (MEDIA): TONY LENTINI (713/296-6227) BILL MINTZ (713/296-7276) DAVID HIGGINS (713/296-6690) (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713/296-6662) (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM FOR RELEASE AT 7:45 A.M. CENTRAL TIME APACHE REPORTS RECORD FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS OF $1.06 PER SHARE Houston, April 22, 2004 - Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today reported record first-quarter 2004 earnings of $348 million, or $1.06 per diluted common share, up from the previous record established in the first quarter of 2003 of $338 million, or $1.05 per share, which included $27 million, or 8 cents per share, for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Apache's results benefited from a 23 percent increase in daily production over the prior-year period and strong commodity prices. Apache's per-share results have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one common stock split distributed in January 2004. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $737 million, up from $645 million in the year-earlier period. (This is a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below.) Apache's debt-to-capitalization ratio declined to 24.2 percent at the end of the quarter, from 26.3 percent at year-end 2003. "Higher production and strong commodity prices drove our record first-quarter financial results," said G. Steven Farris, president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. Strong prices for oil and gas also are driving the acquisition market for producing properties continually higher, Farris said. "We remain committed to long-term profitable growth; although we are always looking for acquisitions which have the potential to bring added value, in the current environment, we intend to continue our active drilling program and to be patient. -more-
Apache reports record first-quarter earnings - add one "During the first quarter, we completed 422 wells worldwide compared to just 156 a year ago. We were active in each of our core areas, and this activity should benefit our financial results in future quarters," Farris said. Apache's first-quarter production averaged 430,400 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, up from 348,600 boe per day in the prior-year period. Liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 228,300 barrels per day, up 37 percent, while natural gas production averaged 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, up 11 percent. Apache received $30.44 per barrel of oil during the first quarter, down slightly from $30.67 in the prior-year period; $23.83 per barrel for natural gas liquids, compared with $24.42 per barrel; and $4.77 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas, down from $5.29 per Mcf. Apache Corporation is a large gas and oil independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Western Australia. -end- NOTE: Apache will webcast its conference call live at 1 p.m. Central Time from its Web site, www.apachecorp.com.

APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands, except per share data)
APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. It is presented because management believes the information is useful for investors because it is used internally and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies, and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity, but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities.
