INDEX TO EXHIBITS

Exhibit 99.1 CONTACTS: (MEDIA): BILL MINTZ (713/296-7276) DAVID HIGGINS (713/296-6690) (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713/296-6662) (WEB SITE): WWW.APACHECORP.COM FOR RELEASE AT 7:45 A.M. CENTRAL TIME APACHE'S THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS RISE 57 PERCENT TO RECORD $432 MILLION, OR $1.31 PER SHARE, ON STRONG PRICES, RECORD PRODUCTION Houston, Oct. 28, 2004 - Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today reported record third-quarter earnings of $432 million, or $1.31 per diluted common share, up 57 percent from $276 million, or 84 cents per share in the prior-year period. The combination of continued strong prices for both oil and natural gas and record oil production fueled Apache's results. Apache's earnings improved 16 percent over the previous record, $372 million or $1.13 per share, which was reported in the second quarter of 2004. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled a record $883 million in the third quarter, up from $731 million in the year-earlier period. (This is a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below.) Apache's third-quarter earnings were reduced by 6 cents per share because of the impact of foreign currency swings on deferred taxes and by 4 cents per share because production was curtailed by Hurricane Ivan. Apache's worldwide daily production averaged 458,412 barrels of oil equivalent during the third quarter, up 2 percent from the prior-year period. Liquid hydrocarbon production averaged 252,800 barrels per day, up 6 percent from the prior-year period and an 8 percent increase from the second quarter of 2004. Higher production in Australia, the North Sea and
China more than offset the impact of Hurricane Ivan, which reduced Apache's U.S. oil production by 4,042 barrels per day during the quarter. Natural gas production averaged 1.23 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, down about 30 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day from the prior-year period, and about 20 MMcf below the second quarter level. Gas production would have been above second-quarter levels had it not been for the impact of Hurricane Ivan. In the third quarter, production from the Forties Field in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea averaged 58,000 barrels of oil per day, up from 47,200 barrels per day in the second quarter, while oil production in Australia averaged 32,200 barrels per day, up 45 percent from the second quarter. Apache's share of production from the Zhao Dong block in Bohai Bay, China, rose to 7,900 barrels per day, up 32 percent from the second quarter. "Apache established a new production record despite the negative effects of Hurricane Ivan," said G. Steven Farris, president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. "What made the difference was growth in other regions, including a 23 percent increase in production from the North Sea." Apache has drilled approximately 1,500 wells in the first three quarters of 2004. "With the impact of our recently completed acquisitions in the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with our active drilling program, we have great momentum going into the fourth quarter and into 2005," Farris said. Commodity prices remained strong in the third quarter. Apache received $38.04 per barrel of oil during the third quarter, up 39 percent from $27.34 in the prior-year period; $26.94 per barrel for natural gas liquids, compared with $18.99 per barrel, and $4.77 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas, compared with $4.45 per Mcf.
Apache's debt-to-capitalization ratio rose slightly to 26.3 percent at the end of the quarter, from 23.2 percent at the end of the second quarter, because of the cost of assets purchased from ExxonMobil and Anadarko Petroleum. Apache Corporation is a large oil and gas independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Western Australia. -end- NOTE: Apache will webcast its conference call live at 1 p.m. Central Time on Oct. 28, 2004, from its Web site, www.apachecorp.com.

This news release contains certain "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, without limitation, expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding production, operating costs, exploration and acquisition activities.

APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands, except per share data)
APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. It is presented because management believes the information is useful for investors because it is used internally and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies, and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity, but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Exhibit 99.2 CONTACTS: (MEDIA): BILL MINTZ (CELL) (281/770-8865) TONY LENTINI (CELL) (713/907-5841) (INVESTOR): ROBERT DYE (713/296-6662) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE APACHE EMPLOYEES REWARDED FOR SHAREHOLDER VALUE INCREASE OF $9 BILLION-PLUS IN FOUR YEARS Houston, Oct. 26, 2004 - Apache Corporation (NYSE, NASDAQ: APA) today announced that it has achieved its goal of doubling its share price in the last four years, adding more than $9 billion in shareholder value. Approximately 1,900 employees will share special incentives in the form of Apache stock paid in three annual installments, reducing Apache's fourth-quarter 2004 net income by approximately $54 million, or 16 cents per diluted common share. In April 2004, Apache employees passed the first threshold in the company's Share Price Appreciation Plan when the stock price reached $43.29 per share. Stock distributed as a result of that achievement will reduce 2004 net income by $16 million, or 5 cents per diluted common share. The second appreciation target was achieved today, when Apache's share price closed at $ 54.05. Under the second achievement, people employed at Apache when the conditional shares were granted in December 2000 will receive shares equivalent to at least 75 percent of their annual salaries at that time. Employees hired after December 2000 but before May 1, 2003, will receive prorated awards. More than 90 percent of the incentives will be paid to non-executive employees. For the two targets achieved to date, the company will issue approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock, net of tax withholding, for the employee awards. -more-
APACHE SHARE APPRECIATION PLAN - ADD 1 Total cost of the program is estimated at $215 million over three years, or about 2 percent of the increase in shareholder value. The current Share Price Appreciation Plan was conceived when the stock price was trading in the range of $60 per share ($25.97 adjusted for the subsequent split and stock dividends), with incentives tied to three appreciation thresholds of $100, $120 and $180 per share, each of which had to be attained for 10 out of 30 consecutive days before year-end 2004. Adjusted for the subsequent split and stock dividends, the threshold targets are now $43.29, $51.95 and $77.92 per share. "Reaching this goal is a great achievement, both for Apache shareholders and our employees," said G. Steven Farris, the company's president, chief executive and chief operating officer. "Higher prices have certainly helped, but in the last four years Apache's reserves have doubled to 1.7 billion barrels equivalent and production has increased 87 percent to approximately 460,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Apache employees under this plan are definitely happy campers." Along with very strong prices, Apache has added nearly $1 billion in properties through acquisitions this year and will drill approximately 1,950 wells that set the stage for future growth of the company. Apache Corporation is a large oil and gas independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Australia. -end- This release contains certain "forward-looking statements" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding Apache's drilling plans. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are the availability of needed personnel and equipment for the future exploration and development, fluctuations in oil and gas prices, and general economic conditions.
