CENTRAL TIME APACHE REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS RISE 62 PERCENT TO $559 MILLION OR $1.67 PER SHARE Houston, April 28, 2005 - Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today reported that higher oil and gas prices and strong production contributed to record first-quarter 2005 earnings of $559 million or $1.67 per diluted common share, up from $345 million or $1.05 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2004. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $1 billion, up from $737 million in the year-earlier period. (This is a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below.) Production averaged 462,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up 7 percent from the first quarter of 2004 and up slightly from last year's fourth quarter. High oil and gas prices were a strong driver for first-quarter financial results. Apache received $46.05 per barrel of oil in the quarter, up 51 percent from the prior-year period; $27.68 per barrel of natural gas liquids, up 16 percent; and $5.30 per thousand cubic feet of gas, up 11 percent. "We are off to a strong start in 2005, with record earnings," said G. Steven Farris, Apache's president, chief executive officer and chief operating officer. "Our successful drilling program in the first quarter and deep inventory of opportunities should contribute to Apache's financial and operating results in coming quarters."
Recent operational highlights include: o Apache drilled two significant discoveries in Egypt during the quarter. The Syrah 1X wildcat, on the company's 100 percent-contractor-interest Khalda Concession, tested 46.5 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas per day. The Tanzanite 1X discovery, located onshore on Apache's 65 percent-contractor-interest West Mediterranean Concession, was tested in two separate Alam el Bueib (AEB) zones. The first tested at a rate of 5,296 barrels of oil and 7 MMcf of gas per day and the second at a rate of 5,631 barrels of oil and 17 MMcf of gas per day. o Apache has drilled 86 wells on Canadian acreage acquired last year in a farm-in from ExxonMobil. Apache has tested 73 wells with productive capacity of 52 MMcf of gas per day. The wells are expected to be brought on production as processing and transportation infrastructure becomes available. o Apache's debt-to-capitalization ratio declined to 22.7 percent at the end of the first quarter, from 24 percent at year-end 2004. Apache Corporation is a large gas and oil independent with core operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea and Western Australia. -end- NOTE: Apache will webcast its conference call live at 1 p.m. Central Time on April 28, 2005, from its Web site, www.apachecorp.com.

APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands, except per share data)
APACHE CORPORATION FINANCIAL INFORMATION (In thousands) NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. It is presented because management believes the information is useful for investors because it is used internally and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies, and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity, but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities.
