Underwriting Agreement
     On January 23, 2007, Apache Corporation ("Apache") entered into a Terms Agreement (and together with the Underwriting Agreement Basic Terms incorporated therein, the "Underwriting Agreement") with Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Underwriters"), for the purchase and sale of (i) $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.625% notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and (ii) $1,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.000% notes due 2037 (the "2037 Notes" and collectively with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes").
     The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Apache, and customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of Apache and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Terms Agreement (including the Underwriting Agreement Basic Terms attached thereto as Annex A), a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Notes
     On January 26, 2007, Apache completed a public offering (the "Offering") of the Notes. Apache registered the sale of the Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-105536), as amended and declared effective by the Commission on January 30, 2004. The net proceeds from the Offering of approximately $1.481 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses but before offering expenses, were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper, which was incurred to finance in part acquisitions made by us in 2006, as described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, and for general corporate purposes. This repayment will reduce the principal amount of our outstanding commercial paper to approximately $220 million. As of January 19, 2007, we had approximately $1.7 billion in principal amount of commercial paper bearing interest at an average weighted rate of 5.37 percent per annum.
     The terms of the Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated as of February 15, 1996, between Apache and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor-in-interest to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as Chemical Bank), as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated November 5, 1996.
     The forms of the 2017 Notes and the 2037 Notes are filed herewith as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
Relationships
     The Underwriters and certain of their affiliates have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions.

     Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), may issue and sell from time to time its debt securities (the "Debt Securities"). The Debt Securities are issuable under an indenture, dated as of February 15, 1996, as supplemented and amended pursuant to a First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of November 5, 1996 (as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.

Each issue of Debt Securities may vary as to series, aggregate principal amount, maturity, interest rate or rates and timing of payments thereof, redemption provisions, if any, and any other variable terms as set forth in the Terms Agreement (as defined below) relating thereto which the Indenture contemplates may be set forth in the Debt Securities as issued from time to time.
     Whenever the Company determines to make an offering of Debt Securities, the Company will enter into an agreement (the "Terms Agreement") providing for the sale of such securities (the "Offered Securities") to, and the purchase and offering thereof by, one or more underwriters specified in the Terms Agreement (the "Underwriters", which term shall include any Underwriters substituted pursuant to Section 10 hereof).

In addition, each Terms Agreement shall specify whether the Company has agreed to grant to the Underwriters an option to purchase additional Offered Securities to cover over-allotments, if any, and the amount of Offered Securities subject to such option (the "Option Securities"). As used herein, the term "Offered Securities" shall include the Option Securities, if any, and "Representatives" shall mean the Underwriter or Underwriters so specified in the Terms Agreement or, if no Underwriter is so specified, shall mean each Underwriter. The Terms Agreement may be in the form of an exchange of any standard form of written telecommunication between the Underwriters and the Company. The offering of the Offered Securities will be governed by the Terms Agreement, as supplemented hereby (collectively, this "Agreement"), and this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon each Underwriter participating in the offering of the Offered Securities.
     The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-105536) for the registration of Debt Securities and other securities, including the Offered Securities, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"), and has prepared and filed such amendments thereto as may have been required to the date hereof.

Any preliminary prospectus supplement to the Base Prospectus that describes the Offered Securities and the offering thereof and is used prior to filing of the Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations is called, together with the Base Prospectus, a "Preliminary Prospectus".

(y) Except as disclosed in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, or in any document incorporated by reference therein, since the end of the Company's most recent audited fiscal year, there has been (i) no material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (whether or not remediated) and (ii) no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
     Any certificate signed by any director or officer of the Company and delivered to the Representatives or to counsel for the Underwriters shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company as to the matters covered thereby.
          SECTION 2. .
Purchase and Sale
     (a) The several commitments of the Underwriters to purchase the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein and therein set forth. Offered Securities which are subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes referred to as "Delayed Delivery Offered Securities" and Offered Securities which are not subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are herein sometimes referred to as "Immediate Delivery Offered Securities".
     (b) In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company may grant, if so provided in the Terms Agreement, an option to the Underwriters named in the Terms Agreement, severally and not jointly, to purchase up to the principal amount of Option Securities set forth therein at the same price per security (plus, except as otherwise provided in the Terms Agreement, interest, if any, accrued and unpaid from the Closing Time until the applicable Date of Delivery), as is applicable to the Offered Securities. Such option, if granted, will expire 30 days after the date of the Terms Agreement, and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time only for the purpose of covering over-allotments which may be made in connection with the offering and distribution of the Offered Securities upon notice by the Representatives to the Company setting forth the principal amount of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time and date of payment and delivery for such Option Securities. Any such time and date of delivery (a "Date of Delivery") shall be determined by the Representatives, but shall not be later than seven full business days and not earlier than two full business days after the exercise of said option, nor in any event prior to the Closing Time, as hereinafter defined, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company. If the option is exercised as to all or any portion of the Option Securities, each of the Underwriters, acting severally and not jointly, will purchase the proportion of the total principal amount of Option Securities then being purchased that the principal amount of
 
Immediate Delivery Offered Securities each such Underwriter has agreed to purchase, as set forth in the Terms Agreement, bears to the total principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives in their discretion shall make to eliminate any sales or purchases in less than authorized denominations.
     (c) Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters shall be made at the place set forth in the Terms Agreement, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, on the third business day (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10) following the date of the Terms Agreement or such other time as shall be agreed upon by the Underwriters and the Company (such time and date being referred to as the "Closing Time"). Except as specified in the Terms Agreement, payment shall be made to the Company by wire transfer in same day funds to the account of the Company specified in the Terms Agreement against delivery to the Underwriters for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by them (unless the Offered Securities are issuable only in the form of one or more global instruments registered in the name of a depository or a nominee of a depository, in which event the Underwriters' interest in such global instrument shall be noted in a manner satisfactory to the Underwriters and their counsel). In addition, in the event that any or all of the Option Securities are purchased by the Underwriters, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of certificates representing, such Option Securities shall be made at such place as shall be agreed upon by the Representatives and the Company, on each Date of Delivery as agreed by the Representatives and the Company. The Immediate Delivery Offered Securities shall be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may request in writing at least two business days prior to the Closing Time or relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be. The Immediate Delivery Offered Securities, which if agreed by the Representatives may be in temporary form, will be made available for examination and packaging by the Representatives on or before the first business day prior to the Closing Time or relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be.
     (d) If authorized by the Terms Agreement, the Underwriters named therein may solicit offers to purchase Offered Securities from the Company pursuant to delayed delivery contracts ("Delayed Delivery Contracts") substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto, with such changes therein as the Company may approve. As compensation for arranging Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company will pay to the Representatives at the Closing Time, for the account of the Underwriters, a fee equal to that percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities for which Delayed Delivery Contracts are made at the Closing Time as is specified in the Terms Agreement. Any Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors of the types set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. At the Closing Time the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts (for not less than the minimum principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities per Delayed Delivery Contract specified in the Terms Agreement) with all purchasers proposed by the Underwriters and previously approved by the Company as provided below, but not for an aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities in excess of that specified in the Terms Agreement. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility for the validity or performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts.
 
     (e) The Representatives are to submit to the Company, at least two business days prior to the Closing Time, the names of any institutional investors with which it is proposed that the Company will enter into Delayed Delivery Contracts and the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by each of them, and the names of the institutions with which the making of Delayed Delivery Contracts is approved by the Company and the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities to be covered by each such Delayed Delivery Contract.
     (f) The principal amount of Offered Securities agreed to be purchased by the respective Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced by the principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts, as to each Underwriter as set forth in a written notice delivered by the Underwriters to the Company; provided, however, that the total principal amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased by all Underwriters shall be the total amount of the Offered Securities covered by this Agreement, less the total principal amount of Delayed Delivery Offered Securities covered by Delayed Delivery Contracts.
     SECTION 3. . The Company covenants with each Underwriter as follows:
Covenants of the Company
(a) Immediately following the execution of the Terms Agreement, the Company will prepare a Prospectus Supplement in form approved by the Representatives setting forth the principal amount of Offered Securities and their terms not otherwise specified in the Indenture, if applicable, the names of the Underwriters and the principal amount of the Offered Securities which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of the Underwriters, the price at which the Offered Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the initial public offering price, the selling concession and reallowance, if any, any delayed delivery arrangements, and such other information as the Representatives and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities. The Company will promptly transmit copies of the Prospectus Supplement to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424 of the 1933 Act Regulations and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) as the Representatives shall reasonably request.
(b) If at any time when the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order that Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the Applicable Time, in the case of the Disclosure Package, or at the time the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, in the case of
 
the Prospectus, or if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly amend the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, whether by filing documents pursuant to the 1934 Act or the 1933 Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, as the case may be, comply with such requirements.
(c) The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days after the close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the 1933 Act Regulations) covering each twelve month period beginning, in each case, not later than the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following the "effective date" (as defined in such Rule 158) of the Registration Statement with respect to each sale of Offered Securities.
(d) While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will give the Representatives notice of its intention to file any additional registration statement with respect to the registration of additional Debt Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement (including any filing under Rule 462(b)) or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or, after the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package, whether pursuant to the 1934 Act, the 1933 Act or otherwise; will furnish the Underwriters with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed a reasonable time in advance of such proposed filing or use, as the case may be; and will not file any such amendment or supplement or other documents in a form to which the Representatives or counsel to the Underwriters reasonably object.
(e) While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will notify the Representatives immediately, and promptly confirm the notice in writing, of (i) the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (ii) the transmittal to the Commission for filing of any supplement to the Prospectus or any document to be filed pursuant to the 1934 Act which will be incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus, (iii) the receipt of any comments from the Commission with respect to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus Supplement, (iv) any request by the Commission for any amendment to the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or any Preliminary Prospectus or for additional information, (v) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
 
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose and (vi) any change in the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company or the public announcement by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
(f) The Company will deliver to each Underwriter one conformed copy of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus) and will also deliver to the Representatives as many conformed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment thereto (without exhibits) as the Representatives may reasonably request. While the Prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will furnish to the Representatives as many copies of the Prospectus (including the Prospectus Supplement) as the Representatives reasonably request.
(g) The Company will endeavor, in cooperation with the Underwriters, to qualify the Offered Securities for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriters may designate, and will maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as may be required for the distribution of the Offered Securities; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified. The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each jurisdiction in which the Offered Securities have been qualified as above provided. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale in any such state or jurisdiction or the initiating or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.
provided
however
(h) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act in connection with sales of the Offered Securities, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, will file all documents required to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act within the time periods prescribed by the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
(i) If specified in the Terms Agreement, between the date of the Terms Agreement and the completion of the distribution of the Offered Securities or the
 
Closing Time, whichever is later, or such other time as is specified in the Terms Agreement, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer or sell, grant any option for the sale of, or enter into any agreement to sell, any debt securities of the Company substantially similar to the Offered Securities (other than the Offered Securities that are to be sold pursuant to such agreement or commercial paper in the ordinary course of business).
(j) The Company will prepare a final term sheet containing only a description of the Offered Securities, in a form approved by the Representatives, and will file such final term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the 1933 Act Regulations within the time required by such rule (such term sheet, the "Final Term Sheet").
(k) The Company represents that it has not made, and agrees that, unless it obtains the prior written consent of the Representatives, it will not make, any offer relating to the Offered Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act Regulations) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations; provided that the prior written consent of the Representatives hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule 1 to the applicable Terms Agreement. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus". The Company agrees that (i) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, and (ii) has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. The Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations, and (b) contains only (i) information describing the preliminary terms of the Offered Securities or their offering, (ii) information permitted by Rule 134 of the 1933 Act Regulations or (iii) information that describes the final terms of the Offered Securities or their offering and that is included in the Final Term Sheet of the Company contemplated in Section 3(j) of this Agreement.
(l) If immediately prior to the third anniversary (the "Renewal Deadline") of December 1, 2005, any of the Offered Securities remain unsold by the Underwriters, the Company will prior to the Renewal Deadline file, if it has not already done so and is eligible to do so, a new shelf registration statement relating to the Offered Securities, in a form satisfactory to the Representatives, and will use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 60 days after the Renewal Deadline. The Company will take all other action necessary or appropriate to permit the public offering and sale of the Offered Securities to continue as contemplated in the expired registration
 
statement relating to the Offered Securities. References herein to the Registration Statement shall include such new shelf registration statement.
     SECTION 4. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements which the Company's officers made in any certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of all of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and under the Terms Agreement, and to the following further conditions:
Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations
(a) At the Closing Time, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission.
(b) At the Closing Time, the Representatives shall have received:
     (1) The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Andrews Kurth LLP, counsel to the Company, to the effect that:
          (i) The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any. To the best knowledge and information of such counsel, the Company is qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in the State of Texas and in each other U.S. jurisdiction listed in such opinion.
          (ii) Each Significant Subsidiary is validly existing as a corporation or other business organization in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation or organization, has the corporate or other entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge and information, is qualified as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each U.S. jurisdiction listed in such opinion; and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable, and to our knowledge is owned of record by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, claim or equity (except as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus); , that in respect of Apache North Sea Limited ("Apache NS"), as to its good standing in any jurisdiction, we opine only that no action is currently being taken by Registrar of Companies of England and Wales for striking Apache NS off the register and dissolving it as defunct, and as far as
provided, however
 
such Registrar is aware Apache NS is not in liquidation or subject to administrative order and no receiver or manager of Apache NS's property has been appointed; and as to the Company's ownership of shares of Apache NS, that all ordinary shares of Apache NS are owned by Apache North Sea Investment ("ANSI") and no charges or mortgages have been registered in Apache NS's or ANSI's register of charges at Companies' House.
          (iii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
          (iv) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Trustee) constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms under applicable laws of the State of New York.
          (v) The Offered Securities, in the form(s) certified by the Company as of the Closing Time, have been duly and validly authorized for issuance, offer and sale pursuant to this Agreement and, when issued, authenticated and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contract and the Indenture against payment of the consideration therefor, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms under applicable laws of the State of New York; and each holder of Offered Securities will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
          (vi) The Offered Securities and the Indenture conform in all material respects to the statements relating thereto in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and the statements in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of Notes" and "Description of Debt Securities", insofar as they purport to summarize certain provisions of documents specifically referred to therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
          (vii) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.
          (viii) The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, has been declared effective by the Commission under the 1933 Act and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission.
          (ix) The Registration Statement, including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, and the Prospectus (except for financial statements and engineering reports and other financial or engineering data, and except for those parts of the Registration Statement that constitute the Form T-1, as to which such
 
counsel need not express any opinion), as of their respective effective or issue dates, appeared on their face to be in all material respects appropriately responsive to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations.
          (x) The statements contained in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the heading "Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations", or similar heading, to the extent that they constitute matters of U.S. federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, are correct in all material respects.
          (xi) Neither the Company nor any Significant Subsidiary is required to be registered under the 1940 Act.
          (xii) No consent, approval, authorization, order, decree, registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental authority or agency under applicable laws is required in connection with the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Delayed Delivery Contract or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained or rendered, as the case may be, or as may be required under the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act, the 1934 Act Regulations or state securities laws; and to the best knowledge and information of such counsel, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contract, if applicable, and the Indenture and the performance by the Company of its obligations set forth herein and therein will not in any material respect conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any specified contract listed in such opinion; nor will such action result, in any material respect, in a violation of the provisions of the charter or bylaws of the Company or any applicable law or regulation, or, to the best knowledge and information of such counsel, any administrative or order or decree specified or described in such opinion.
          (xiii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and information, other than in respect of matters disclosed in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, there is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any court or governmental agency or body, domestic or foreign, now pending, or overtly threatened against or affecting, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, which would be reasonably expected to result in any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations or business affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, or would materially and adversely affect the properties or assets thereof or would materially and adversely affect the consummation of this Agreement, the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if applicable, or the Indenture or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.
          (xiv) Each document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act and incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus (except for
 
exhibits, financial statements, supporting schedules or other financial or statistical information as to which no opinion need be rendered) appeared on its face to be appropriately responsive as to form when so filed to the requirements of the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
     In rendering such opinion, counsel for the Company may rely as to matters of fact upon the representations of officers of the Company contained in any certificate delivered to such counsel and certificates of public officials, which certificates shall be attached to or delivered with such opinion. Such opinion shall be limited to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the laws of the State of New York, the laws of the State of Texas and the laws of the United States of America, and shall be further limited to applicable laws and regulations of such jurisdictions that, in the experience of such counsel, are normally applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, the Indenture and the Offered Securities. With respect to the opinions set forth in Section 4(b)(1)(ii) above, such counsel may rely upon, and assume the accuracy of, matters set forth in the opinions of counsel licensed in the jurisdiction in which each such Significant Subsidiary is organized, and the language of such opinion may be conformed to the language of such other opinions of local counsel. The opinion regarding enforceability referred to in Sections 4(b)(1)(iv) and 4(b)(1)(v) above will be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity, whether enforcement is sought at law or in equity. Such opinion of counsel shall further be subject to customary assumptions, qualifications and exceptions.
     (2) The favorable opinion, dated as of the Closing Time, of Sidley Austin LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (i) to (viii), inclusive, of subsection (b)(1) of this Section.
     (3) In giving their opinions required by subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2), respectively, of this Section 4, Andrews Kurth LLP and Sidley Austin LLP shall each additionally state that in the course of the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus such counsel has considered the information set forth therein in light of the matters required to be set forth therein, and has participated in conferences with officers and representatives of the Company including its independent public accountants, during the course of which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Such counsel need not independently check the accuracy or completeness of, or otherwise verify, and accordingly need not pass upon, and accordingly need not assume responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus and such counsel may, in good faith, rely as to facts necessary to the determination of materiality upon the judgment of officers and representatives of the Company. Such counsel shall additionally state that, however, as a result of such consideration and participation, nothing has come to such counsel's attention which causes such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at the time it became effective (or, if an amendment to the Registration Statement or an Annual Report on Form 10-K has been filed by the Company with the
 
Commission subsequent to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, then at the time such amendment became effective or at the time of such filing, as the case may be), or as of the "new effective date" with respect to the Underwriters pursuant to, and within the meaning of, Rule 430(B)(f)(2) of the 1933 Act Regulations, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time the Prospectus was issued at the time any such amendment or supplement was issued or, at the Closing Time included or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) the Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such counsel need not make any statement with respect to the financial statements and engineering reports and other financial or engineering data contained in the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus) or those parts of the Registration Statement which constitute the Form T-1, or the Disclosure Package).
(c) At the Closing Time, there shall not have been, since the date of the Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, or in the Disclosure Package, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, and the Representatives shall have received a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer, President or Vice President and the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer, the principal financial officer or principal accounting officer of the Company, dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that (i) there has been no such material adverse change with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 are true and correct as of the Closing Time, (iii) the Company has performed or complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the date of such certificate and (iv) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened by the Commission. As used in this Section 4(c), the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Underwriter or Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the Offered Securities.
 
(d) (1) On the date of the Terms Agreement, the Underwriters shall have received a letter from Ernst & Young LLP, dated as of the date thereof and in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters, to the effect that:
          (i) They are independent accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
          (ii) It is their opinion that the consolidated financial statements and supporting schedule(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and audited by them and covered by their opinions therein comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1933 Act Regulations, the 1934 Act and the 1934 Act Regulations.
          (iii) In addition to the audit referred to in their opinion, they have performed specified procedures, not constituting an audit, including a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its indicated subsidiaries, a reading of the minute books of the Company and such subsidiaries since the end of the most recent fiscal year with respect to which an audit report has been issued, inquiries of and discussions with certain officials of the Company and such subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters with respect to the latest available interim unaudited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter and setting forth the results of such inquiries and procedures.
     (2) At the Closing Time, the Underwriters shall have received from Ernst Young LLP, a letter, dated as of the Closing Time, to the effect that they reaffirm the statements made in the letter furnished pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this Section, except that the specified date referred to shall be a date not more than three days prior to the Closing Time.
(e) At the Closing Time, counsel for the Underwriters shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to evidence the accuracy and completeness of any of the representations and warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Company in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities as herein and in the Terms Agreement contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives.

     SECTION 6. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act as follows:
Indemnification
(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, including information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B of the 1933 Act Regulations, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact included in the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the information contained in the Final Term Sheet, or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or omission or such alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by an Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Base Prospectus, such preliminary prospectus supplement, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, such Final Term Sheet or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto);
(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission; provided that such settlement is effected with the written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including the fees and expenses of counsel chosen by such Underwriter), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is not paid under (i) or (ii) above.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in subsection (a) of this Section, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any
 
amendment thereto), any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the information contained in the Final Term Sheet, or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, such preliminary prospectus supplement, such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, such Final Term Sheet or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
     (c) Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that each Underwriter shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Underwriters and their respective controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Section if, in the judgment of any of the Underwriters, it is advisable for such Underwriter or Underwriters and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which shall not unreasonably be withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) For purposes of this Section 6, all references to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, Final Term Sheet or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to include, without limitation, any electronically transmitted copies thereof, including, without limitation, any copies filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR.
 
     SECTION 7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Offered Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total commission or underwriting discount received by each Underwriter, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Prospectus Supplement, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Offered Securities sold to or through such Underwriter as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities sold to or through such Underwriter were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the
Contribution
 
same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount of Offered Securities sold to or through each Underwriter and not joint.
     SECTION 8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person of an Underwriter, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any Offered Securities.
Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery
     SECTION 9. .
Termination
     (a) The Representatives may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to the Closing Time if (i) there has been, since the date of the Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the results of operations, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) there shall have occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Offered Securities or enforce contracts for the sale of the Offered Securities, or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended by the Commission or a national securities exchange, or if trading generally on either the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices for securities have been required, by either of said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental authority, or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal, New York or Texas authorities or if a banking moratorium shall have been declared by the relevant authorities in the country or countries of origin of any foreign currency or currencies in which the Offered Securities are denominated or payable, or (iv) the rating assigned by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of the Terms Agreement shall have been lowered since that date or if any such rating organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any debt securities of the Company, or (v) there has been a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States, or (vi) there shall have come to the attention of the Representatives any facts that would cause them to reasonably believe that (x) the Disclosure Package, at the Applicable Time, or (y) the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Offered Securities, including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172 of the 1933 Act Regulations, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
 
the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading. As used in this Section 9, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the applicable Underwriter or Underwriters for use in confirming sales of the related Offered Securities.
     (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except to the extent provided in Section 5. Notwithstanding any such termination, (i) the covenants set forth in Section 3(b), (d), and (e) with respect to any offering of Offered Securities shall remain in effect so long as any Underwriter owns any such Offered Securities purchased from the Company pursuant to this Agreement and during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered in connection with sales of the Offered Securities and (ii) the covenants set forth in Section 3(c), (g), (h) and, if applicable, (i), the provisions of Section 5, the indemnity agreement set forth in Section 6, the contribution provisions set forth in Section 7 and the provisions of Sections 8, 11, 12 and 13 shall remain in effect.
     SECTION 10. . If one or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time or a Date of Delivery to purchase the Immediate Delivery Offered Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then the Representatives shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, during such 24 hours the Representatives shall not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the Defaulted Securities, then:
Default
(a) if the amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the amount of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, each of the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or
(b) if the amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the number of Immediate Delivery Offered Securities to be purchased on such date, the applicable Terms Agreement or, with respect to any Date of Delivery which occurs after the Closing Time, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and of the Company to sell the Option Securities to be purchased and sold on such Date of Delivery shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement or, in the case of a Date of Delivery which is after the Closing Time, which does not result in a termination of the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase and the Company to sell the relevant Option Securities, as the case may be, either the Representatives or
 
the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Underwriter under this Section 10.

     APACHE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of            Dollars on January 15, 2017 ("Stated Maturity") and to pay interest thereon from January 26, 2007 or from the most recent date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for, on January 15 and July 15 of each year (each, an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing July 15, 2007, and at Stated Maturity or upon such other date on which the principal of this Note becomes due and payable, whether by declaration of acceleration, notice of redemption or otherwise, and including any Redemption Date or Change in Control Purchase Date (each such date, "Maturity"), at the rate of 5.625% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture referred to below, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered as of the close of business on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be (whether or not a Business Day), next preceding such Interest Payment Date (each such date, a "Regular Record Date"). Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder of this Note on such Regular Record Date, and shall be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to the Holder of this Note not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
     Payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, this Note will be made at the office or agency maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the related record date; provided further, that, notwithstanding anything else contained herein, if this Note is a Global Security and is held in book-entry form through the facilities of the Depository, payments on this Note will be made to the Depository or its nominee in accordance with the arrangements then in effect between the Trustee and the Depository.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the succeeding pages hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth herein.
CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein, referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company issued under an Indenture, dated as of February 15, 1996, and supplemented November 5, 1996 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor-in-interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), designated as the 5.625% Notes due 2017 (the "Notes"), limited to $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. Reference is made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. All terms used in this Note set forth below which are not defined herein and which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     The Indenture provides for the defeasance of the Notes and certain covenants in certain circumstances.
     This Note is unsecured as to payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest, and ranks pari passu with all other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company.
     Interest payments on this Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity hereof, as the case may be. Interest payments for this Note shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
     In the case where the applicable Interest Payment Date or Maturity with respect hereto, as the case may be, does not fall on a Business Day, payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest otherwise payable on such day need not be made on such day, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or at Maturity and, unless the Company defaults on such payment, no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the period from and after the Interest Payment Date or such Maturity, as the case may be, to the date of payment. "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.
     The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund and, except as provided in the Indenture or herein, will not be redeemable or repayable prior to their Stated Maturity.
     The Notes are redeemable as a whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100 percent of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Rate plus 15 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest to the Redemption Date. The Company will, however, pay the interest installment due on any Interest Payment Date that occurs on or before a Redemption Date to the Holders as of the close of business on the Regular Record Date immediately preceding that Interest Payment Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (a) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month); or (b) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the Calculation Date or does not contain such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date.
     The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day next preceding the date fixed for redemption (the "Calculation Date").
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the U.S. Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes.
 
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means either Banc of America Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., or their respective successors, as specified by the Company, or, if those firms are unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of (1) Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors; provided, however, that if either of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any three other Primary Treasury Dealers selected by the Company after consultation with the Independent Investment Banker.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date.
     Holders of Notes to be redeemed will be given notice of redemption, at their addresses as set forth in the Security Register for the Notes, by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, as provided in the Indenture.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
     If any Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
     As set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, the Indenture, no Holder of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes, or for any remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request, to the Trustee to institute such proceeding as Trustee, (iii) the Trustee shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days after receipt of such written notice, request and offer of indemnity and (iv) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60 day period; provided, however, that such limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment of the principal of or premium, if any, and any interest on this Note on or after the respective due dates expressed herein or to require the purchase of this Note by the Company upon the occurrence of a Change in Control in accordance with the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series thereunder to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66-2/3% in aggregate principal amount of such Securities then Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series thereunder at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain restrictive provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange for or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     No reference to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and any interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Note is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series and of like tenor of any authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this
 
Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any interest on this Note are payable or at such other offices or agencies as the Company may designate, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to, the Company and the Security Registrar or any transfer agent duly executed by the registered owner hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, if any Change in Control occurs prior to the Stated Maturity of the Notes, the Company shall, at the option of the Holders thereof, purchase all Notes for which a Change in Control Purchase Notice shall have been delivered as provided in the Indenture and not withdrawn, by a date which shall be 35 Business Days after the occurrence of such Change in Control, at a Change in Control Purchase Price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Change in Control Purchase Date, which Change in Control Purchase Price shall be paid in cash.
     Holders have the right to withdraw any Change in Control Purchase Notice by delivering to the paying agent a written notice of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.
     If cash sufficient to pay the Change in Control Purchase Price of all Notes or portions thereof to be purchased on the Change in Control Purchase Date is deposited with the Trustee on the Change in Control Purchase Date, interest shall cease to accrue on such Notes (or portions thereof) and on and after the Change in Control Purchase Date the Holders thereof shall have no other rights as such (other than the right to receive the Change in Control Purchase Price upon surrender of such Notes).
     Subject to the terms of the Indenture, prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture, the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     The Indenture and this Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.
     This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication hereon shall have been executed by the Trustee.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, APACHE CORPORATION has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
