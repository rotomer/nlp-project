Exhibit 99.1
FOR RELEASE AT 7 A.M. CENTRAL TIME
     Houston, July 26, 2007  Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today reported second-quarter earnings of $632 million or $1.89 per diluted common share on record production and strong commodity prices. In the year-earlier period, Apache earned $722 million or $2.17 per share. Excluding a non-recurring benefit of $132 million, or 39 cents per share, for a reduction in Canadian tax rates, Apache earned $590 million or $1.78 per share in the prior period.
     Production totaled 572,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, up 14 percent from the year-earlier period and 7 percent from the first quarter of 2007, driven by successful drilling in the United States, Australia and Argentina and an acquisition of producing properties in the Permian Basin.
     Worldwide liquid hydrocarbon production increased to 265,537 barrels per day, up 11 percent from the prior-year period. Gas production averaged 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, up 18 percent from the year-earlier quarter.
     Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled a record $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion in the year-earlier period. (This is a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation below.)
     "Apache's record second-quarter production was fueled by growth across our portfolio," said G. Steven Farris, Apache's president and chief executive officer. "With our strong first-half performance, we are well on our way to achieving growth at the top of our expected range of 9-12 percent in 2007."
     Apache continued to benefit from a positive oil price environment, especially in overseas markets. Worldwide, Apache received $64.12 per barrel, level with the prior-year period and up 15 percent from the first quarter. Apache received $66.75 per barrel produced by the company's overseas operations compared with $60.72 per barrel in North America.
     Apache received $5.51 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas, up from $4.97 per Mcf in the prior-year period and $5.22 per Mcf in the first quarter.
     "In Apache's core growth areas of Australia, Canada and Egypt, we have matured a number of high potential exploration plays, many of which are being drilled this year," Farris said. "We are also developing six projects that are expected to add production of 108,000 boe per day by 2010."
     In Australia, Apache announced a successful appraisal of the Julimar discovery. "The Julimar East-1 encountered 224 feet of net pay in six different zones, bolstering our belief that the recoverable reserves in the Julimar complex exceed 1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas," he said.
 
     Apache also announced plans to proceed with the Van Gogh and Pyrenees offshore developments; together, the two fields are expected to add net production of 40,000 barrels per day in 2009. The Van Gogh project's first horizontal development well, the Theo 3-H, tested at a rate of 9,694 barrels per day from the main top-Barrow field pay.
     In Egypt, Apache is on track to achieve its goal of doubling production by 2010 through exploration, waterflood projects and additional developments at the Qasr field on the Khalda concession.
     Apache is a large oil and gas independent with operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea, Egypt, Australia and Argentina.

This news release contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including, without limitation, expectations, beliefs, plans and objectives regarding production and exploration activities. Any matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking and, accordingly, involve estimates, assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our 2006
Form 10-K
and on our website. There is no assurance that Apache's expectations will be realized, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.
 
 
 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:
The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. It is presented because management believes the information is useful for investors because it is used internally and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies, and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity, but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities.
