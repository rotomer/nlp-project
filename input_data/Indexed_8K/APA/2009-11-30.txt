FOR RELEASE AT 7:45 A.M. CENTRAL TIME
HOUSTON, TX, November 27, 2009  Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) announced today that it has elected to redeem all $100 million of its outstanding 5.68% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, no par value per share (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), on December 30, 2009 (the "Series B Redemption Date").
Apache has also authorized Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Depositary under the Deposit Agreement dated as of August 25, 1998, to simultaneously redeem all of its Depositary Shares each representing one-tenth of one share of Series B Preferred Stock (CUSIP 037411 40 2) (the "Depositary Shares") on December 30, 2009 (the "Depositary Shares Redemption Date"). The Depositary Shares, which were issued in book entry form, are not listed on a stock exchange.
Apache ended the third quarter with $1.4 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and debt was 25 percent of total capitalization. By redeeming the $100 million, 5.68% Series B Preferred Stock with cash that is currently invested in short-term U.S. government securities, Apache will further reduce its average cost of funds.
The Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemed at a redemption price of $1,000 per share, plus $9.47 in accrued and unpaid dividends, through the Series B Redemption Date, for an aggregate redemption price of $1,009.47 per share of Series B Preferred Stock.
