Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On August 13, 2010, Apache Corporation (" ") entered into a $1.0 billion 364-day syndicated senior revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement (the " "), among Apache, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and Citibank, N.A., Bank Of America, N.A. and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as Co-Syndication Agents, and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc Of America Securities, LLC and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, As Co-Lead Arrangers And Joint Bookrunners, and the lenders party thereto.
Apache
364-Day Credit Agreement
     Apache may borrow, repay and reborrow under the 364-Day Credit Agreement subject to covenants, events of default and representations and warranties that are substantially similar to those in Apache's existing revolving credit facilities. The aggregate amount at any time outstanding under the 364-Day Credit Agreement may not exceed the total commitment amount of $1.0 billion. The 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for Apache's recently announced acquisition of BP properties and for its general corporate purposes, including any non-hostile acquisitions, or to backup its commercial paper facilities.
     The 364-Day Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due on August 12, 2011 unless Apache requests a 364 day extension not less than 90 days prior to the termination date or Apache elects the Term Out Option described below. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is subject to additional 364 day extensions provided that Apache requests such extension not less than 90 days prior to the effective termination date (as extended). No lender is under any obligation to consent to any 364 day extension; however, Apache may elect to repay loans from any non-consenting lender and terminate such lender's loan commitment, or replace any non-consenting lender, and in either case proceed with its requested 364 day extension with respect to the remaining balance of the loan commitments under the 364-Day Credit Agreement, provided that lenders having at least 51% of the aggregate total loan commitments have agreed to the requested extension.
     Apache may also elect to convert the outstanding revolving loans into a term loan of like amount on the termination date (as extended) (the " ") by providing notice to the Administrative Agent no less than three days prior to such termination date and paying a fee equal to 1.0% of the loans outstanding. If Apache exercises the Term Out Option, no amounts paid or prepaid may be reborrowed and the term loan will be due and payable in a single payment one year following the date of such conversion.
Term Out Option
     All borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement will bear interest at one of the following two rate options, as selected by Apache:
     Apache must also pay a commitment fee on the 364-Day Credit Agreement equal to a rate per annum that varies from .10% to .35% of the undrawn amount under 364-Day Credit Agreement based upon the rating for its senior, unsecured non-credit enhanced long term indebtedness for borrowed money. The commitment fee is currently .125%.
 
     The foregoing summary of the 364-Day Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.
     The 364-Day Credit Agreement has been filed with this report to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Apache. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the 364-Day Credit Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the 364-Day Credit Agreement. The representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the 364-Day Credit Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Apache or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the 364-Day Credit Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Apache's public disclosures.

     SECTION 10.13 . It is the intention of the parties hereto to conform strictly to applicable interest, usury and criminal laws and, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of Borrower to a Lender or any Agent under this Agreement shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest shall not be required to the extent that receipt thereof would be contrary to provisions of law applicable to such Lender or Agent limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Lender or Agent. Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be illegal, unenforceable, usurious or criminal under laws applicable to a Lender or Agent (including the laws of any jurisdiction whose laws may be mandatorily applicable to such Lender or Agent notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document but subject to hereof) then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is agreed as follows:
Interest Rate Limitation
Section 2.12
     (i) the provisions of this Section shall govern and control;
     (ii) the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received under this Agreement, or under any of the other aforesaid agreements or otherwise in connection with this Agreement by such Lender or Agent shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable law (such maximum lawful interest rate, if any, with respect to each Lender and the Agent herein called the ""), and any excess shall be cancelled automatically and if theretofore paid shall be credited to Borrower by such Lender or Agent (or, if such consideration shall have been paid in full, such excess refunded to Borrower);
Highest Lawful Rate
     (iii) all sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to such Lender or Agent for the use, forbearance and detention of the indebtedness of Borrower to such Lender or Agent hereunder or under any Loan Document shall, to the extent permitted by laws applicable to such Lender or Agent, as the case may be, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread throughout the full term of such indebtedness until payment in full so that the actual rate of interest is uniform throughout the full term thereof;
     (iv) if at any time the interest provided pursuant to this Section or any other clause of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with any other fees or compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document and deemed interest under laws applicable to such Lender or Agent, exceeds that amount which would have accrued at the Highest Lawful Rate, the amount of interest and any such fees or compensation to accrue to such Lender or Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be limited, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to that amount which would have accrued at the Highest Lawful Rate, but any subsequent reductions, as applicable, shall not reduce the interest to accrue to such Lender or Agent pursuant to this Agreement below the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest accrued pursuant to this Agreement or such other Loan Document, as the case may be, and such fees or compensation deemed to be interest equals the amount of interest which would have accrued to such Lender or Agent if a varying rate per annum equal to the interest provided pursuant to any other relevant
 
Section hereof (other than this Section), as applicable, had at all times been in effect, plus the amount of fees which would have been received but for the effect of this Section; and
     (v) with the intent that the rate of interest herein shall at all times be lawful, and if the receipt of any funds owing hereunder or under any other agreement related hereto (including any of the other Loan Documents) by such Lender or Agent would cause such Lender to charge Borrower a criminal rate of interest, the Lenders and the Agents agree that they will not require the payment or receipt thereof or a portion thereof which would cause a criminal rate of interest to be charged by such Lender or Agent, as applicable, and if received such affected Lender or Agent will return such funds to Borrower so that the rate of interest paid by Borrower shall not exceed a criminal rate of interest from the date this Agreement was entered into.
