Merger Agreement
Apache
Merger
     In connection with the Merger, Apache issued approximately 17.5 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $800 million in cash to former Mariner stockholders in exchange for their shares of Mariner common stock. The Apache shares issued to Mariner stockholders represent approximately 5% of Apache's issued and outstanding common stock after the Merger, based upon the number of Apache shares outstanding at November 10, 2010. Apache did not issue any fractional shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger. For each fractional share that would have otherwise been issued, Apache paid cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of the fractional share and the average of the closing price of Apache common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, for the five consecutive trading days ending on the calendar day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger.
 
     Under the merger agreement, Mariner stockholders had the option to elect to receive consideration consisting of cash, shares of Apache common stock or a combination of both in exchange for their shares of Mariner common stock, subject to a proration feature. Mariner stockholders electing to receive a mix of cash and stock consideration and non-electing stockholders were entitled to receive $7.80 in cash and 0.17043 shares of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock. Subject to proration, Mariner stockholders electing to receive all cash were entitled to receive $26.00 in cash for each share of Mariner common stock and Mariner stockholders electing to receive only Apache common stock were entitled to receive 0.24347 shares of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock.
     The final results of merger consideration elections by Mariner stockholders are not yet available. Apache intends to file an amendment to this Item 2.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K to include the final results of the merger consideration elections once they become available.
     The foregoing description of the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibits 2.1 to Apache's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16, 2010 and August 3, 2010 and incorporated herein by reference.
     The information set forth under Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.
     On November 10, 2010, Apache issued a press release announcing the completion of the Merger. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
     Houston, Nov. 10, 2010  Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today announced that it has completed its merger with Mariner Energy (NYSE: ME).
     The merger closed today following its approval by Mariner's stockholders and subsequent completion of documentation. Apache issued approximately 17.5 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $800 million in cash to Mariner stockholders. Apache also assumed Mariner's debt with current fair value of approximately $1.6 billion. As a result of the merger, former Mariner stockholders own approximately 5 percent of Apache's outstanding shares of common stock.
     At a special meeting, 79.1 percent of Mariner's stockholders voted to approve the merger.
     Under the merger agreement, Mariner stockholders had the option to elect to receive consideration consisting of cash, shares of Apache common stock or a combination of both in exchange for their shares of Mariner common stock, subject to a proration feature. Mariner stockholders electing to receive a mix of cash and stock consideration and non-electing stockholders will receive $7.80 in cash and 0.17043 shares of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock. Subject to proration, Mariner stockholders electing to receive all cash will receive $26.00 in cash per Mariner share and Mariner stockholders electing to receive only Apache common stock will receive 0.24347 shares of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock. Trading in Mariner's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange will cease after market close today.
     "The Mariner merger  along with our $7 billion acquisition of BP's upstream operating regions in the Permian Basin, Canada and Egypt and our earlier $1 billion acquisition of Devon's Gulf of Mexico
 
Shelf assets  will provide Apache with a rich inventory of growth and value-enhancement opportunities for years to come," said G. Steven Farris, Apache's chairman and chief executive officer.
     At year-end 2009, Mariner had estimated proved reserves of 181 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) (47 percent liquid hydrocarbons) in the Gulf Shelf and deepwater, onshore Gulf Coast, Permian Basin and unconventional onshore plays, as well as unbooked resource potential of 2 billion boe. Mariner's deepwater portfolio includes 125 blocks, seven discoveries in development  including interests in the world-class Lucius and Heidelberg discoveries  and more than 50 prospects. During the third quarter, Mariner produced 51,348 boe per day.
     "Apache's team  including new hands from Mariner, BP and Devon  is looking forward to tackling the enlarged opportunity base that these assets bring to three core regions in our portfolio," Farris said. "The Mariner merger also adds a new dimension to our portfolio  deepwater oil exploration.
     "Apache has a truly unique culture, with a strong sense of urgency, the empowerment of our employees, and an independent mindset; it's at the heart of how we build value," Farris said. "Apache's sense of urgency was a factor in our team's ability to attain seven of the 13 new drilling permits approved by federal regulators for all operators since June."
