Merger Agreement
Apache
Merger
     In connection with the Merger, Apache issued approximately 17.5 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $800 million in cash to former Mariner stockholders in exchange for their shares of Mariner common stock. The Apache shares issued to Mariner stockholders represent approximately 5% of Apache's issued and outstanding common stock after the Merger, based upon the number of Apache shares outstanding at November 10, 2010. Apache did not issue any fractional shares of its common stock in connection with the Merger. For each fractional share that would have otherwise been issued, Apache paid cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of the fractional share and the average of the closing price of Apache common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, for the five consecutive trading days ending on the calendar day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger.
 
     Under the merger agreement, Mariner stockholders had the option to elect to receive consideration consisting of cash, shares of Apache common stock or a combination of both in exchange for their shares of Mariner common stock, subject to a proration feature. Mariner stockholders electing to receive a mix of cash and stock consideration and non-electing stockholders were entitled to receive $7.80 in cash and 0.17043 shares of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock. Subject to proration, Mariner stockholders electing to receive all cash were entitled to receive $26.00 in cash for each share of Mariner common stock and Mariner stockholders electing to receive only Apache common stock were entitled to receive 0.24347 shares of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock.
     Mariner stockholders received the following consideration for each share of Mariner common stock they owned, depending upon the elections, if any, which they made, and the proration feature of the Merger Agreement:

Exhibit 99.2
     Houston, Nov. 15, 2010  Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today announced the final results of the merger consideration elections made by stockholders of Mariner Energy, Inc. concerning the form of consideration they wish to receive in connection with the acquisition of Mariner by Apache. Apache completed the acquisition on Nov. 10, 2010, after approval of the merger by Mariner's stockholders.
     A total of 101.37 million shares of Mariner common stock were outstanding at the time of the merger. The results of election for the outstanding shares of Mariner common stock are as follows:
 
     Under the merger agreement, Mariner stockholders had the option to elect to receive consideration consisting of cash, shares of Apache common stock or a combination of both in exchange for their shares of Mariner common stock, subject to a proration feature. Mariner stockholders electing to receive a mix of cash and stock consideration and non-electing stockholders were entitled to receive $7.80 in cash and 0.17043 of a share of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock. Subject to proration, Mariner stockholders electing to receive all cash were entitled to receive $26.00 in cash per Mariner share and Mariner stockholders electing to receive only Apache common stock were entitled to receive 0.24347 of a share of Apache common stock in exchange for each share of Mariner common stock.
     Based on the terms of the merger agreement, and the election results and proration feature:
 
     Pursuant to the merger agreement between Apache and Mariner, fractional shares of Apache common stock will not be issued. Mariner stockholders will receive cash in lieu of their fractional share interests in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.
