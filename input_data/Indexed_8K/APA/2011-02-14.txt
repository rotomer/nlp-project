On February 9, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Apache Corporation (the "Company") voted to increase the size of the Board from twelve persons to thirteen persons and to elect Messrs. Scott Josey and Chansoo Joung as new directors. Mr. Josey was elected to fill the vacancy created by the increase in the size of the Board, and will serve as a director with a term expiring at the Company's 2012 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Joung will fill a previous vacancy and will serve as director with a term expiring at the Company's 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. The Board has not yet determined the committees to which Mr. Josey and Mr. Joung will be appointed. On February 10, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing these elections, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
For their service, Messrs. Josey and Joung will receive compensation that is commensurate with that received by the Company's other non-employee directors, although the annual retainer will be pro-rated to reflect their length of service in 2011. The description of such compensatory arrangements under the caption "Director Compensation" in the Company's definitive proxy statement, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2010, is incorporated by reference herein.
Messrs. Josey and Joung have (i) no arrangements or understandings with any other person pursuant to which they were elected for the positions described above, (ii) no family relationship with any director or other executive officer of Apache or any person nominated or chosen by Apache to become a director or executive officer, and (iii) no transactions in which they have an interest requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
On February 9, 2011, Mr. Thomas P. Chambers, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the Company, was awarded 20,000 restricted stock units pursuant to Apache's 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. 4,000 of such restricted stock units will vest on each of April 2, 2012, February 9, 2013, February 9, 2014, February 9, 2015, and February 9, 2016. Upon vesting, Apache will issue one share of Apache's common stock as settlement for each restricted stock unit. 2,400 of the shares vesting each year for Mr. Chambers will be subject to the restriction that none of such 2,400 shares will be eligible for sale by the recipient until such time as he retires or otherwise terminates employment with Apache. A form of the restricted stock unit agreement is included as an exhibit to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

     3. . 2,400 of the Shares vesting each year pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan shall be subject to the restriction that none of such shares shall be eligible to be sold by the Participant until such time as the Participant retires or otherwise terminates employment with the Company. The remaining 1,600 Shares vesting each year shall vest free of restrictions, except those, if any, required by applicable securities laws, and may be sold at any time to pay taxes or for other reasons.

Custody
     6. . Subject to earlier settlement or forfeiture as provided in Section 9 and any deferral election under Section 8, Restricted Stock Units awarded hereunder shall vest in accordance with the following table.
Vesting and Settlement
The Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock on the date on which such Restricted Stock Units vest. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock if counsel to the Company determines that such sale or delivery would violate any applicable law or any rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any rule or regulation of, or agreement of the Company with, any securities exchange or association upon which the Common Stock is listed or quoted. The Company shall in no event be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the delivery of shares of Common Stock to comply with any such law, rule, regulation or agreement.
     7.  The company will pay to the Participant an amount equivalent to any cash dividends declared on the Common Stock as soon as administratively practicable after the payment date for such dividend, in proportion to the number of unvested Restricted Stock Units as of the record date for such dividend, with the following exception. Any such payments that would be made before March 9, 2012 shall instead be accumulated and paid as soon as administratively practicable after the earliest of the following dates, but only if the Participant is still employed by the Company on such date: March 9, 2012; the date of the Participant's death; the date the Committee determines the Participant is Disabled; or the date of a Change of Control that is described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the participant is not employed by the Company on such date, the accumulated payments shall be forfeited.

The Participant may, within 30 days of the Award Date and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Deferred Delivery Plan, elect to defer receipt of Shares that would otherwise be issued on a Vesting Date in settlement of all or any part of a Tranche of Restricted Stock Units. If the Participant makes such an election, effective as of the applicable Vesting Date, each Restricted Stock Unit so deferred shall thereafter be a Stock Unit (as defined in the Deferred Delivery Plan) and settlement of the Stock Units shall be in accordance with the Deferred Delivery Plan except that the restrictions in Section 3 shall

continue to apply to any shares of Common Stock issued in settlement of the Stock Units until such restrictions would have expired had such shares been issued in settlement of the Restricted Stock Units. Any such deferral of less than 100 percent of the Shares shall apply on a pro rata basis to both Shares subject to the restriction against sales and those Shares not subject to restriction.
     9. . Except as set forth below, this Agreement and each Award shall be subject to the condition that the Participant has remained an Eligible Employee from the initial award of an Award until the applicable Vesting Date as follows:

     (b) If the Participant dies or becomes Disabled before an applicable Vesting Date, the Restricted Stock Units that would have vested at the next Vesting Date shall thereupon vest, the restrictions in Section 3 shall lapse and the then vested Restricted Stock Units shall be settled as soon as administratively practicable following the date the Participant dies or becomes Disabled. Any Restricted Stock Units not already vested or vested by reason of death or Disability shall be immediately cancelled. If the Participant dies before settlement, settlement shall be made to the beneficiary designated for this purpose in the manner prescribed by the Committee, or, if there is no such beneficiary, to the estate of the Participant.
     (c) If, before March 9, 2012, the Participant is terminated by the Company without Cause and not by reason of becoming Disabled or if the Participant terminates his employment for Good Reason, then all unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be cancelled. If, after March 8, 2012, the Participant is terminated by the Company without Cause and not by reason of becoming Disabled or if the Participant terminates his employment for Good Reason, then all Restricted Stock Units shall thereupon vest, the restrictions in Section 3 shall lapse, and, subject to the terms of the Deferred Delivery Plan, if applicable, the Restricted Stock Units shall be settled as soon as administratively practicable following the date the Participant's employment is terminated.
     (d) Notwithstanding Section 12 of the Plan or subsections 9(a), 9(b), or 9(c), if the Participant is employed by the Company when a Change of Control that is described in Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Internal Revenue Code occurs, any unvested Restricted Stock Units shall vest, the restrictions in Section 3 shall lapse, and settlement of the newly vested Restricted Stock Units shall occur on the date of such Change of Control or as soon thereafter as is administratively practicable.

The Participant may pay all or any portion of the taxes required to be withheld by the Company or paid by the Participant in connection with all or any portion of this Award by delivering cash or by electing to have the Company withhold shares of Common Stock that would have otherwise been delivered to Participant having a Fair Market Value determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan, equal to the amount required to be withheld or paid.

No Ownership Rights Prior to Issuance of Shares
     12. . Subject to the conditions and exceptions set forth in Deferred Delivery Plan, if elected, and Section 14.2 of the Plan, the Restricted Stock Units (and, while subject to the restrictions in Section 3, the Shares) shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or to a trust for estate planning purposes or a family partnership.
Non-Transferability of Restricted Stock Units
     13. . Neither the Restricted Stock Units nor any terms contained in this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any express or implied right to be retained in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate for any period, nor restrict in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate, which right is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate the Participant's employment or service at any time for any reason. The Participant acknowledges and agrees that any right to have restrictions on the
No Right to Continued Employment

Restricted Stock Units lapse is earned only by continuing as an employee of the Company or an Affiliate at the will of the Company or such Affiliate, or satisfaction of any other applicable terms and conditions contained in the Plan and this Agreement, and not through the act of being hired, being Awarded the Restricted Stock Units or acquiring Shares hereunder.
     14. . In consideration for this award of Restricted Stock Units, the Participant agrees to comply with the terms of the Plan and this Agreement. This Agreement is subject to all the terms, provisions and conditions of the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, and to such regulations and administrative interpretations thereunder as may from time to time be adopted by the Committee.

     HOUSTON, Feb. 10, 2011  Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) today announced the election of Chansoo Joung, a senior advisor at Warburg Pincus LLC, and Scott Josey, former chairman and chief executive officer of Mariner Energy, to its board of directors.
     Joung, who joined Warburg Pincus in 2005, provides advice on new and existing investments in the energy sector for the firm. Previously, he was an investment banker at Goldman Sachs for nearly 18 years. He headed the firm's Americas Natural Resources Group from 1999-2004.
     "Chansoo has spent almost his entire career in finance in the energy industry, both advising and investing in companies across a number of energy sectors," said Charles J. Pitman, chairman of the Apache board's corporate governance and nominating committee. "He has broad experience that enables him to identify, assess, and manage risks that can affect a large energy company such as Apache."
     Josey served as the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Mariner Energy from August 2001 until November 2010, when it merged with Apache. Previously, he served as vice president of Enron North America and co-managed its Energy Capital Resources group, provided investment banking services to the oil and gas industry and portfolio management services to institutional investors as a co-founder of Sagestone Capital Partners, and was a director with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. in its energy investment group. From 1982 to 1993, he worked in all phases of drilling, production, pipeline, corporate planning and commercial activities at Texas Oil and Gas Corp.
     "Scott has spent his entire career, spanning 30 years, in the oil and gas industry," Pitman said. "As the former chief executive officer, president and chairman of the board of Mariner, he gained extensive management, financial and technical expertise in oil and gas, and an excellent understanding of the many issues that confront exploration and production companies."
