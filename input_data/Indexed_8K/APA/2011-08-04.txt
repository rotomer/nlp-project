Exhibit 99.1
FOR RELEASE AT 7:15 A.M. CENTRAL TIME
Houston, August 4, 2011  Apache Corporation (NYSE, Nasdaq: APA) reported production of 749,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day and earnings of $1.2 billion, or $3.17 per diluted share, for the three-month period ending June 30, 2011. These compare with production of 647,000 boe per day and net income of $860 million, or $2.53 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year.
     "Apache had an outstanding quarter with record production in oil, gas, and natural gas liquids," said G. Steven Farris, chairman and chief executive officer. "This reflects the scale and balance of our portfolio, which comes from diversity across geographic regions, gas and liquids production, and a constant focus on rate of return. We're realizing additional value from last year's acquisitions and pursuing opportunities for future growth at both our legacy assets and in new areas."
     The combination of higher oil prices and record production levels resulted in record quarterly revenues for second quarter 2011. Oil and gas revenues were $4.4 billion, a 47 percent increase from revenues of $3.0 billion for the same period last year. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities* also were a quarterly record at $2.6 billion, up 44 percent from the prior year's $1.8 billion. Excluding certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results, Apache reported adjusted earnings* of $1.3 billion in second quarter 2011 compared with $834
 
million in the year-earlier period. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were $3.22 in the second quarter compared with $2.46 per diluted share in the prior-year period.
     Liquid hydrocarbons represented 49 percent of production and 78 percent of revenues. Apache benefited from higher oil prices for its international production indexed to Dated Brent benchmarks, as well as sweet crudes from the Gulf of Mexico, which continue to receive a meaningful premium per barrel compared with production benchmarked to West Texas Intermediate prices.
     On the operational and commercial front, the company has achieved several recent milestones. These include:
 
     "Our regional business model is central to our value creation," Farris said. "It provides us with many ways to win  we're not dependent on any single market or play. This results in more predictable, profitable long-term growth."
     Apache Corporation is an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom North Sea, Australia and Argentina.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:
:
Reconciliation of income attributable to common stock to adjusted earnings
The press release discusses Apache's adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results and are meaningful for the following reasons:
:
Reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities
The press release discusses Apache's cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities. It is presented because management believes the information is useful for investors because it is used internally and widely accepted by those following the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of a company's ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities, fund dividend programs, and service debt. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas exploration and production companies, and is frequently included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities, therefore, is an additional measure of liquidity, but is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities.
