Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:

News
) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2002 and operating results from worldwide exploration and development drilling activity.
FOURTH QUARTER 2002
For the fourth quarter of 2002, the company reported net income available to common shareholders of $309 million, or $1.21 per share (diluted), compared with earnings of $108 million, or 41 cents per share (diluted)(1) for the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in earnings is primarily due to higher commodity prices and higher oil sales volumes, which were partly offset by lower natural gas sales volumes.
Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $713 million, or $2.76 per share (diluted), compared with $528 million, or $1.99 per share (diluted), for the same period in 2001.
Sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2002 were flat compared to the same period in 2001 at about 49 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). Production increases in Algeria, Wyoming and Western Canada were offset by the effects of natural field declines and asset sales, along with two hurricanes in the Gulf.
FULL YEAR 2002
For the full year 2002, Anadarko reported net income available to common shareholders of $825 million, or $3.21 per share (diluted), on revenues of $3.86 billion, compared with a net loss of $188 million, or 75 cents per share (diluted)(1), on revenues of $4.72 billion(2) for 2001. Results for 2001 included the effect of a $1.57 billion non-cash, after-tax impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties. Excluding the effect of the impairment, 2001 earnings were $1.38 billion, or $5.21 per share (diluted). Earnings in 2002 were lower compared with 2001 excluding the impairment mainly because natural gas prices were 33 percent lower in 2002 compared with 2001.
Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for 2002 totaled $2.21 billion, or $8.52 per share (diluted), compared with $3.43 billion, or $12.89 per share (diluted) in 2001.
Total natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes for 2002 were 197 million BOE, compared with 199 million BOE in the prior year. Despite the modest decline in annual production, the company achieved growth in several areas of North America, taking into account the effect of divestitures of producing properties in Canada, Texas and Louisiana in 2002.
"We had a successful 2002, despite a challenging market environment in the first half of the year," said John Seitz, Anadarko President and CEO. "We did what we set out to do in terms of positioning Anadarko for sustainable growth in the future.
"We had expected 2002 to be an 'opportunity building' year and it was. By executing our strategic plan, we more than replaced our production with new reserves, made several good discoveries and an important acquisition that will add to our production and reserves in 2003 and in the future, and built a strong inventory of drilling locations," Seitz said.
"Despite production losses due to two hurricanes and the strikes in Venezuela, we beat our target of 196 million BOE.
"With stronger commodity prices - and still reasonable drilling and service costs - we're ready to start growing production again, and we're well positioned to do that in 2003 and 2004," Seitz said. "Nearly two-thirds of our 2003 capital budget of $2.3 billion is devoted to development projects. This budget also enables us to test significant exploration potential, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and in several international basins," he added.
FOURTH QUARTER 2002 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
Anadarko announced in January 2003 its first Algerian discovery since the company signed a new exploration agreement in mid-2002. The Hassi Berkine North East No. 1 on Block 404 of the Berkine Basin was drilled to a total depth of 10,700 feet at a location three miles east of the Hassi Berkine field. The well encountered 53 feet of net pay in the TAGI reservoir and tested at a rate of 4,092 barrels of oil and 6.7 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day.
In the northern portion of the Vernon field in North Louisiana, Anadarko completed its best-producing well to date in that field, the Nix 2-1, which had initial production of 24.7 MMcf of natural gas per day.
In early December 2002, Anadarko completed the acquisition of Howell Corporation for about $258 million in cash and debt assumed from Howell. The purchase gives Anadarko additional opportunities for reserve and production growth through enhanced oil recovery and other exploitation activities in the Salt Creek and Elk Basin oilfields of Wyoming.
During the fourth quarter, Anadarko agreed to sell 300 non-core properties in Southeast New Mexico to Pecos Production Company for $41 million. The sale closed in January 2003.
Anadarko and Warren Resources agreed to jointly explore for and develop coalbed methane resources in the Atlantic Rim area of the Washakie Basin in Southern Wyoming. The area of mutual interest covers approximately 211,000 acres in Carbon County. During 2003, Anadarko expects to drill 30 wells in this area.
RESERVE REPLACEMENT
Anadarko's worldwide reserve replacement rate from all sources was 112 percent of annual production, with 219 million BOE of new reserves added. This figure includes the effect of reserve changes from all sources - drilling, producing property acquisitions and divestitures, and revisions to earlier estimates.
This is the 21st consecutive year that Anadarko has more than replaced annual production with new proved reserves.
Excluding acquisitions and divestitures in 2002 and the effect of a downward revision of Venezuelan reserves described below, the company replaced 106 percent of its 2002 production. Significant reserves were added in the Gulf of Mexico, Wyoming, Texas, Louisiana and Canada.
In the U.S. alone, Anadarko achieved a 185 percent reserve replacement rate. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures - principally the Howell acquisition, partly offset by several small divestitures - the company replaced 137 percent of its U.S. production.
At year-end, the company recorded a downward revision of 36 million barrels - representing roughly 16 percent of total 2002 reserve additions - from the Oritupano-Leona oilfield in Venezuela due to current prices. Under the terms of Anadarko's risk service contract with the national oil company of Venezuela, Anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices. This means that higher oil prices actually reduce the company's reported oil reserves and production volumes from that project; however, reserve and production fluctuations caused by current prices and reported using the economic interest calculation have essentially no impact on cash flow or the value of the project.
The company's worldwide replacement rate for the five-year period 1998-2002 was 368 percent of production, or 187 percent excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. Anadarko's U.S. reserve replacement rate for the five-year period 1998-2002 was 325 percent, or 179 percent excluding acquisitions and divestitures, versus a five-year industry average of 111 percent for 1997-2001, which is the latest available data (source: U.S. Department of Energy).
PROVED RESERVES
Anadarko increased proved reserves worldwide by 1 percent to 2.33 billion BOE at year-end 2002, from 2.30 billion BOE at year-end 2001. In the U.S., proved reserves increased by 111 million BOE primarily from discoveries and the acquisition of Howell. On a worldwide basis, the U.S. increase was partly offset by the effect of asset sales, performance revisions and the significant downward revision in Venezuela.
U.S. - Domestic proved reserves were 1.53 billion BOE at year-end, representing 66 percent of total worldwide reserves. U.S. reserves were up 8 percent from the 1.41 billion BOE at the end of 2001, or 61 percent of total reserves.
Canada - The sale of heavy oil properties containing 28 million BOE of reserves in the fourth quarter of 2002 was responsible for reduced Canadian proved reserves, which declined to 288 million BOE at year-end, from 315 million BOE at year-end 2001.
Algeria - Oil reserves in Algeria were 372 million barrels at year-end 2002, down from 387 million barrels the prior year. The company added 8 million barrels of reserves during 2002, partly offsetting production of 23 million barrels. The company resumed exploration in Algeria last year after a five-year hiatus.
Worldwide - Anadarko's proved reserves were nearly balanced between crude oil, condensate and liquids (49 percent) and natural gas (51 percent). Proved reserves of oil and liquids totaled 1.13 billion barrels at year-end 2002, the same as a year earlier. Proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2002 totaled 7.18 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), up from 7.03 Tcf in 2001. Of this amount, 98 percent is located in the U.S. and Canada.
Acquisitions and Divestitures - Acquisitions of producing properties - principally the Howell properties in Wyoming and BP's interest in an Anadarko-operated oilfield in Qatar - added 87 million BOE of reserves in 2002. Divestitures - mainly heavy oil assets in Western Canada, non-core properties in South Texas and South Louisiana, and non-producing gas properties in the Cook Inlet of Alaska - totaled 39 million BOE of reserves.
FINDING & DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Anadarko's total worldwide finding costs for proved reserves averaged $10.52 per BOE in 2002, reflecting all costs of additions from drilling, property acquisitions and the effect of reserve revisions.
"This one-year finding and development cost number doesn't accurately reflect the exploration successes we achieved in some key areas in 2002," Seitz said.
"For example, in the United States, which is our single largest focus area, finding and development costs came in at $7.77 per BOE," Seitz said. "This reflects successful drilling in core areas such as Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming and the expansion of plays in the Gulf of Mexico. The purchase of new properties in Wyoming last year also added low-cost reserves with high potential for expanding future production and reserves," he noted.
"Several factors contributed to the higher one-year worldwide finding costs, but two had the greatest impact, adding nearly $2 a barrel to overall finding costs," Seitz said.
"The revision of Venezuelan reserves combined with large investments made in leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico - which have not yet been drilled - raised our costs," Seitz said. "If you excluded these two factors, our finding and development costs would have been about $8.75 per BOE in 2002.
"We expect 2003 finding costs to be lower - probably in the $7 per BOE range," he noted.
Anadarko added reserves of 87 million BOE through property acquisitions during 2002 at an average price of $4.82 per BOE. The company sold 39 million BOE of non-core or low-margin reserves at an average price of $5.85 per BOE.
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is one of the world's largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies. Houston-based Anadarko is active in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and Qatar and is executing strategic exploration programs in several other countries. More information is available at

Anadarko Announces $2.3 Billion Capital Budget for 2003 Friday January 31, 8:08 am ET
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2003--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:
APC
-
News
)
North American development spending to increase 50 percent
Adjusted volumes expected to increase 5 percent
The Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:
APC
-
News
) has approved a $2.3 billion capital budget for 2003 that should enable the company to grow production to 200 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), explore in a number of key basins and reduce debt. The company spent nearly $2.4 billion in 2002.
"The goal of this year's budget is to harvest the benefits of the work we've been doing over the last couple of years - and to set ourselves up for greater production and reserve growth in 2004," said John Seitz, Anadarko President and CEO.
"We recognize that this is a conservative budget, considering the commodity price trends we're seeing for the remainder of the year. Based on current NYMEX prices, it now appears that cash flow could be closer to $3 billion. But since so much of our activity is front-end loaded to the first half of the year, it makes sense to wait until mid-year to see if prices hold before we commit to a higher capital spending plan," Seitz said.
"Even at relatively modest price forecasts, Anadarko expects to have about $300 million of free cash flow, which we plan to use to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt. If we have additional cash, we have plenty of good opportunities to invest in growth projects," Seitz said.
Anadarko expects to operate an average of about 50 drilling rigs in North America during 2003 - compared with 38 during 2002. This program should enable Anadarko to increase production to about 200 million BOE. Taking into account the full-year effect of asset sales on 2002 volumes, this represents a 5 percent increase over last year.
Anadarko has allocated nearly $1.5 billion to worldwide development projects in 2003 - a 35 percent increase from last year - primarily for fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Western Canada, East and Central Texas, North Louisiana and Wyoming.
Approximately $381 million is earmarked for exploration in North America, the Middle East, North and West Africa and Australia - a 56 percent decrease from 2002 funding levels. Almost 70 percent of this year's exploration budget will be used to evaluate the company's previous investments in land and seismic.
The budget also includes $107 million for infrastructure and other construction projects and $337 million for capitalized interest and overhead.
"This year's program will be more development driven, particularly in the U.S. onshore and Canada," Seitz said. "With oil and gas prices so strong and drilling and oilfield service costs still fairly reasonable, it makes sense to tap our inventory of development locations.
"Capital spending in Algeria and Alaska will decline this year because we've largely completed major construction projects there. Our focus in these areas during 2003 will be exploration and additional development drilling," Seitz said.
"Despite the reduction in overall exploration spending this year, we still have substantial exposure to some very high-potential exploration opportunities, both in North America and internationally. We'll be spending a lot less on up-front activities such as lease acquisition than we did last year, however," he noted.
LOWER 48
A total of $672 million is budgeted for Lower 48 onshore development this year - a 50 percent increase from the prior year. In addition, $84 million is allocated for exploration.
Approximately $130 million is earmarked for the East Texas Bossier play, primarily for development of the Dowdy Ranch and Bald Prairie areas and for continued delineation and development of the Gregory and Louetta Parker discoveries. Forty-seven development and four exploration wells are planned for 2003 in the Bossier.
"The work we do this year around Gregory and Louetta Parker is extremely important, because if these turn out to be sizeable discoveries, the Bossier will remain one of our major areas of activity for many more years to come," Seitz said. "The 10 delineation wells we plan to drill in these discovery areas could set up a strong inventory of new locations for the next several years."
In North Louisiana, the company plans to spend $122 million to continue developing the Vernon field and delineate last year's Ansley discovery. Twenty-seven development wells and two exploration wells are planned in this area.
In the Giddings area of Central Texas, Anadarko plans to drill 60 development wells in 2003. This $130 million program includes additional delineation, development and recompletion drilling in the Austin Chalk formation and additional development in the Glen Rose/James Lime formation. The company also will continue its successful program of re-entering existing shallow wells and recompleting them to the Austin Chalk and deeper Buda and Georgetown formations. Continued infill drilling in the Brookeland field in the East Chalk area is planned.
Anadarko's $237 million overall program for Wyoming and other Western states is highlighted by new activities in enhanced oil recovery using CO2 injection and in coalbed methane production.
In preparation for the CO2 injection program start-up, approximately 33 new wells are planned in the Monell field, and a number of wells will be drilled, recompleted or reworked in the Salt Creek field, which Anadarko acquired through the purchase of Howell Corporation in late 2002. Included in the activities at Salt Creek will be a CO2 pilot project that will be used to optimize the upcoming field-wide CO2 flood. Also as part of this project, the company will build 158 miles of pipelines as part of a CO2 delivery system that will serve both Salt Creek and Monell.
In addition, a number of new wells, recompletions and workovers are planned in the Elk Basin field, which also was acquired last year.
The company plans to drill 100 coalbed methane wells in the County Line and Atlantic Rim fields, along with 30 wells in the Copper Ridge area of Wyoming this year.
In conventional development in the West, Anadarko plans to participate in 92 wells, half of which are non-operated wells in the Wamsutter field in Wyoming. The company also plans to purchase and expand a gas processing plant serving the Table Rock field, which will provide economic enhancement for additional development drilling opportunities in this field.
Two exploration wells are planned this year on the Land Grant using results from recently completed 2-D seismic surveys.
Overall, onshore Lower 48 production is expected to increase to 106 million barrels - an increase of 3 percent, adjusting for the effect of producing property sales during 2002.
GULF OF MEXICO
Approximately $460 million is budgeted for projects in the Gulf of Mexico, of which $363 million will go toward development and $98 million toward exploration. This development budget is more than double 2002 levels. And while the exploration budget will be considerably lower than in 2002, it will be more heavily focused on drilling this year.
Anadarko plans to drill as many as 10 exploration wells in the Gulf this year. Five are planned in deepwater acreage, three in subsalt, and two conventional shelf tests. The first deepwater well on the Jubilee prospect, which straddles the Central and Eastern Gulf, is expected to spud in the first quarter of 2003.
Development spending in the Gulf will increase by $188 million from 2002, as several key development programs get under way. Plans are being finalized for the Tarantula subsalt discovery at South Timbalier Block 308, which is expected to come on-line in late 2004. In total, 30 development wells are planned, including 18 conventional wells on the shelf, where the majority of production growth from the Gulf is expected to come on-line in 2003. In the subsalt shelf area, six development wells and recompletions are planned, including additional drilling at the Mahogany and Hickory fields and at the Tarantula discovery. In addition, six deepwater development wells are planned around the Marco Polo and K2 field discoveries. First production from Marco Polo is expected in early 2004.
Total production from the Gulf of Mexico is expected to increase by nearly 13 percent during 2003 to 22 million barrels.
CANADA
As part of an overall $363 million capital spending plan for Canada, Anadarko plans to drill 322 development wells and 43 exploration wells during 2003. This budget is roughly flat with 2002 and reflects similar spending allocations year-to-year between exploration and development. The company expects to operate more than 20 rigs during the winter drilling season this year.
Exploration focus will include the Fort Liard area of the southern Northwest Territories, where Anadarko expects to drill several wells this year, plus the Slave Point play, the Foothills, and the Peace River Arch area, where Anadarko is rapidly developing the Saddle Hills gas play.
Delineation drilling is planned in the Monkman area, where Anadarko and its partners last year announced a major gas discovery, and in the Foothills area.
Production from Canada is expected to be 33 million BOE in 2003 - an 11 percent increase over 2002 levels, adjusting for the effect of the sale of Canadian heavy oil properties in December 2002. Growth is expected primarily from development projects in the Wild River area of the Deep Basin, the Saddle Hills area and the Devonian Slave Point play.
ALASKA
As part of an overall $63 million exploration and development program for Alaska in 2003, Anadarko plans to test two prospects, including a potential satellite near the Alpine field and another well in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The company is also planning to conduct 400 square miles of 3-D seismic surveys north and south of the Alpine oilfield and 300 miles of 2-D seismic in the Brooks Range Foothills.
In addition, 16 development wells are planned as part of the ongoing Alpine field development. Net production from Alpine is expected to be 6 million barrels in 2003 - about the same as last year.
ALGERIA
Anadarko's 2003 Algeria program will focus on exploration and development drilling as part of a $98 million budget. This represents a $41 million decline in capital spending, as major construction projects at the HBNS and Ourhoud central processing facilities near completion.
Anadarko plans to drill or participate in a total of 42 wells to further develop the Ourhoud and Block 404 fields. Delineation drilling also will continue in Block 208, where initial engineering work will begin this year on a new central production facility.
Anadarko also expects to drill five exploration wells on Blocks 404 and 208, targeting TAGI and deeper zone potential.
Algerian net production is expected to be 23 million barrels - about the same as in 2002.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL
In other international activity, Anadarko plans to spend $139 million - primarily for ongoing development projects and for high-potential exploration drilling.
In Qatar, the company expects to increase gross production from the Al Rayyan oilfield to about 30,000 barrels a day by the fourth quarter of 2003.
In addition, Anadarko will drill or participate in seven exploration wells in Qatar, Oman, Gabon, Tunisia and Australia during the first half of 2003.
Average production volumes from these areas is expected to increase by almost 19 percent during 2003 to a combined 10 million barrels, primarily from increases in Qatar.

Anadarko Provides Guidance for 1st Quarter, Full Year 2003 Friday January 31, 8:07 am ET
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2003--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:
APC
-
News
) said today it expects to earn $1.15 per share (diluted) for the first quarter of 2003, with expected cash flow of $2.60 per share (diluted).
For the full year, the company expects earnings of $3.90 per share (diluted) and cash flow of $10.10 per share (diluted).
PRICE ASSUMPTIONS
Anadarko's 2003 estimates assume average NYMEX oil prices of $29 per barrel for the first quarter and $24 per barrel thereafter, with a full-year average of $25.25. The company's natural gas price estimate is $5 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for the first quarter, and $4 per Mcf thereafter, for a full-year average of $4.25 per Mcf. To determine realized prices Anadarko used these estimates, plus or minus an expected price "differential" for each of the company's major producing areas, and any adjustment for hedge positions. Price data are shown on an attached financial table
For 2003, Anadarko has hedged approximately 40 percent of its natural gas production through June and 35 percent for July through December. About 35 percent of Anadarko's oil production is hedged through December 2003. The hedge positions are under both fixed-price and "collared" transactions, which use price ceilings and floors to help ensure sales prices within a determined range. A summary of the company's hedge positions is shown on an attached financial table.
VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS
Oil and gas sales volumes are expected to total 44 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in the first quarter. Full-year 2003 sales volumes are expected to total 200 million BOE.
"Our 2003 volumes will be 3 million barrels lower than we had forecast earlier because of the effect of higher oil prices on our Venezuelan production, which reduced volumes by 2 million barrels, and the ongoing strike in Venezuela, which reduced estimated volumes by 1 million barrels," said John Seitz, Anadarko President and CEO.
"Higher oil prices reduce our share of reported production under the terms of a risk service contract with the state oil company, whereby Anadarko earns a fee that translates into barrels of oil based on current prices. So the price-related volume impact has essentially no impact on revenues. The strike-related reductions are expected to reduce cash flow by less than $20 million," he noted.
First quarter volumes will be lower than last year's fourth quarter due to three factors: Fourth quarter volumes from Algeria were unusually high due to an extra tanker lifting that had been delayed from the third quarter. First quarter volumes will be impacted by the strike in Venezuela and by a scheduled two-month shutdown of the Al Rayyan oilfield in Qatar for installation of new production facilities.
"But since our 2003 capital program is weighted to the first half of the year, production should ramp up every quarter, and our fourth quarter production is expected to be about 20 percent higher than the first quarter," Seitz said. "That's the key to growth in 2004."
An attached financial table includes detailed production estimates for each of Anadarko's key operating regions.
CAPITALIZATION RATIO
Anadarko expects to reduce its debt-to-total-capitalization ratio from about 44 percent currently to 40 percent by year-end 2003. The company expects to end the year with debt of approximately $5.3 billion.
EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL
The Earnings and Modeling Conference Call is set for today at 11 a.m. CST (12 p.m. EST). This call will include a discussion of detailed financial issues that support the company's projections of future-period earnings. More details are available at
