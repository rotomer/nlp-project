Exhibit 99.1 Anadarko Announces Strong First-Quarter Earnings, Increases Capital Budget, Raises 2003 Guidance HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 25, 2003--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) -- Earnings driven by higher energy prices -- Capital budget increased by 9 percent to $2.5 billion -- Exploration success logged in Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Algeria -- Production volumes set to grow throughout 2003 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced net income available to common shareholders of $418 million, or $1.63 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.26 billion for the first quarter of 2003. Results include an after-tax gain of $47 million, or 18 cents per share (diluted) related to the Jan. 1, 2003 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Net income available to common shareholders before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was $371 million, or $1.45 per share (diluted). For the same period in 2002, the company earned $88 million, or 34 cents per share (diluted), on revenues of $790 million. The increase in earnings in the first quarter of 2003 is primarily due to sharply higher commodity prices, partly offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the divestiture of some low-margin North American producing properties in 2002 and other temporary factors affecting production from international fields. "We had a great start to what we expect to be a year of record earnings for the company," said Robert J. Allison, Jr., Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. "Our first quarter performance was stronger than we had forecast, both operationally and financially. "We had some nice discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Algeria, and we still have a number of high-impact exploration wells drilling that will be completed early in the second quarter. "Strong energy prices in the first quarter allowed us to fund an aggressive exploration and development drilling program and still have excess cash flow, which enabled us to further strengthen our balance sheet," Allison said. During the first quarter of 2003, sales volumes totaled 45 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), or 498,000 BOE per day, down 10 percent from the first quarter of 2002 due to several factors, including: 1) the divestiture in 2002 of approximately 7 million BOE of annual production in North America, primarily heavy oil in Canada; 2) the scheduled shut-in of the Al Rayyan oil field in Qatar since February to install a new production facility; 3) the effect of higher oil prices in Venezuela - where contract terms with the national oil company provide Anadarko with specific amounts of revenues that are converted to volume equivalents at prevailing market prices, giving Anadarko lower oil volumes when prices increase; and 4) the completion of cost recovery in Algeria. Anadarko previously had been reimbursed for earlier exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production. North American natural gas volumes of 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day were 6 percent lower than a year earlier due to a 10 percent decline in U.S. production, partly offset by a 12 percent increase in production from Western Canada. Anadarko's realized average natural gas price in the first quarter of 2003 was $4.62 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) - more than double that of the year-earlier period. Oil production in the first quarter was 173,000 barrels a day - 18 percent lower than a year earlier - as a result of the factors mentioned above. Realized oil prices, meanwhile, were 54 percent higher than a year ago, at $28.59 per barrel. "We expect production volumes to build each quarter throughout the year, as we bring on additional production in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, Qatar and the Lower 48," Allison said. "Total volumes in the fourth quarter of this year should be about 20 percent higher than in the first quarter," he noted. "We're still expecting 2003 volumes to be about 5 percent higher than last year's volumes, adjusting for the effect of our 2002 property sales. Next year's volumes are forecast to increase 12 percent over 2003 levels," Allison said. FIRST QUARTER 2003 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- In the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko made a natural gas discovery at its Jubilee prospect, the first well in Anadarko's Eastern Gulf exploration program. The Atwater Valley 349 No. 1 well was drilled in 8,800 feet of water to a target depth of 18,310 feet and encountered 83 feet of net pay. Although the company has not yet determined proved reserves, the estimated recovery is expected to be 40 million to 50 million BOE. The company believes Jubilee could be commercially produced when hub facilities are established in the area. Anadarko also authorized construction of an $86 million production platform for its Tarantula subsalt discovery on South Timbalier Block 308. The platform will have a capacity of 100 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of natural gas and 30,000 barrels per day of oil. First production is expected in the fourth quarter of 2004. Anadarko holds a 100 percent working interest in both fields. -- In North Louisiana, average daily gross natural gas production from the Vernon area increased from the fourth quarter of 2002 by 26 percent to 120 MMcf per day in the first quarter of 2003. First-quarter drilling focused on extending the Vernon field boundaries and developing the "sweet spots." Among the standout wells drilled during the quarter was the Smith 9-1 in the northwest portion of the field, which tested at 11.5 MMcf of gas per day. Anadarko has a 97.7 percent working interest in that well. Four others also tested at rates between 8 MMcf and 10 MMcf per day. Several offsets are planned. -- In Algeria, Anadarko and partners Sonatrach, Maersk and Eni-Lasmo announced the partnership's second oil discovery since resuming exploration in October 2002 on Block 404 in the Berkine Basin. The SFSW-1 discovery well was drilled to a total depth of 10,637 feet and encountered 36 feet of net oil pay in the TAGI reservoir. It tested at a rate of 2,689 barrels per day of 47 degree API gravity oil and 4.72 MMcf per day of gas. -- In Canada, Anadarko announced a natural gas discovery in the Saddle Hills area of Alberta, increasing proved reserves by over 40 Bcf of gas from this multi-zone play. The Saddle Hills 15-34-75-7W6 discovery well, drilled into the Devonian, flowed at a rate of 15.9 MMcf per day of gas. With this 100 percent-owned well online and other activity this year, total gas production from Saddle Hills increased to 80 MMcf per day, compared with just 2 MMcf per day a year earlier. FINANCIAL DATA Three pages of summary financial data for the first quarter of 2003 follow, as well as one page providing detailed financial guidance for the second quarter and full year 2003. In addition, another page summarizes the company's current hedge positions for the second quarter of 2003 and for the remainder of 2003 and 2004. CAPITAL BUDGET INCREASE The Board of Directors has approved a $200 million increase in the company's 2003 capital budget, which will enable Anadarko to accelerate its exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico, Algeria and Canada and more aggressively develop key producing fields in Canada and East Texas. This increase, about three-quarters of which will go toward exploration, will raise Anadarko's capital budget to $2.5 billion. EARNINGS GUIDANCE Anadarko expects to earn $289 million, or $1.15 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2003, with expected cash flow from operating activities of $710 million. The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 252 million. For the full year, the company expects earnings of $1.39 billion, or $5.51 per share (diluted) and cash flow from operating activities of $3.16 billion. The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 253 million. Second-quarter and full year 2003 estimates of shares outstanding reflect the redemption on April 15, 2003, of the company's Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures due 2020. Anadarko paid $556.46 per debenture, reflecting the issue price plus accrued interest as of the redemption date, which is equivalent to $47.85 per share under the conversion provisions. Price Assumptions Anadarko's 2003 estimates assume average NYMEX oil prices of $27 per barrel for the second quarter, dropping to $25 per barrel for the remainder of the year, with a full-year average of $27.75 per barrel. The company's NYMEX natural gas price estimate is $5 per Mcf both for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, with a full-year average of $5.40 per Mcf. To determine realized prices, Anadarko used these estimates, plus or minus an expected price "differential" for each of the company's major producing areas, and any adjustment for hedge positions. For 2003, Anadarko has hedged approximately 51 percent of its natural gas production for the second quarter and 45 percent for July through December. About 32 percent of Anadarko's oil production is hedged through December 2003. The hedge positions are under both fixed-price transactions and "collared" transactions, which use price ceilings and floors to help ensure sales prices within a determined range. Volume Assumptions Oil and gas sales volumes are expected to total 48 million BOE in the second quarter. Full-year 2003 sales volumes are expected to total 200 million BOE. EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL TODAY AT 9:30 A.M. CDT, 10:30 A.M. EDT Anadarko will host an earnings conference call today at 9:30 a.m. Central Daylight Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss first quarter 2003 results and the company's outlook for the remainder of the year.
