Exhibit 99 Anadarko Updates Guidance for Production & Earnings HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 5, 2003-- -- VOLUME FORECAST LOWERED -- EARNINGS GUIDANCE RAISED Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today lowered its 2003 targets for crude oil and natural gas sales based on development drilling results and production issues. Anadarko also increased earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2003 and full year due to higher commodity prices, which more than offset the lower volumes. Revised Production Guidance Oil and gas sales volumes for 2003 are now expected to be 190 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), including 46 million BOE for the second quarter, down from the previous forecast of 200 million BOE and 48 million BOE, respectively. "Production problems in three areas -- the Gulf of Mexico, Algeria and Qatar -- require that we revise our production volume expectations at this point," said Robert J. Allison, Jr., chairman, president and CEO of Anadarko. "Because Anadarko has a broad portfolio of producing fields and development projects, we are usually able to offset downside performance with upside production from other fields. Production in other areas is on target or ahead of forecast this year, but unfortunately the magnitude of the shortfalls, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, is too large to offset," Allison said. "While we believe the shortfalls in Algeria and Qatar are temporary, the production issues in the Gulf of Mexico will affect us next year as well. We are still targeting strong production growth in 2004, but we recognize that earnings and returns matter as much as volume targets. Lately, we've seen some property acquisitions that offer better returns for our shareholders, so we may choose to add projects to our portfolio that would let us achieve our target." The following table provides the geographic breakout of this revised volume forecast: Previous 2003 Revised 2003 (million BOE) Forecast Forecast U.S. Onshore 112 112 U.S. Offshore 22 17 Canada 33 33 Algeria 23 20 Other International 10 8 Total 200 190 Gulf of Mexico The company is experiencing lower-than-expected production, primarily due to performance from three fields in the Gulf of Mexico - -- Hickory, Tanzanite and Pardner. In the Hickory and Tanzanite fields, natural gas production dropped unexpectedly from two high-volume wells due to downhole mechanical failures. Following recompletion of the Hickory well to a higher zone, production was restored at lower rates. Meanwhile, the company opted to produce two new wells in these fields from zones that are deeper than the initial targets in order to maximize recoveries. This has delayed production from the original target zones. These zones are expected to produce at higher rates. The company expects that reserve estimates for these fields will not be significantly affected by these issues. Also, the company's Pardner field recently came on production at rates much lower than anticipated. Technical studies are under way to understand why the well is not producing as expected and to determine if a repair can be made to increase the volumes. Algeria Despite early production from the Ourhoud field, Anadarko's net oil sales volumes for the year are expected to be below the company's previous forecast as a result of delays in several pipeline projects that are currently under construction. Daily production close to target levels has been achieved for short periods this year, indicating some progress has been made with these projects. These pipeline projects are expected to be completed later this year. Qatar Start-up delays mainly due to weather will reduce expected volumes for the second quarter of 2003 and the full year. Following the installation of a new production facility, the Al Rayyan field was restarted in May and is currently producing more than 20,000 barrels of oil a day (gross). Production is expected to end the year at 25,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 barrels a day previously forecast, as a result of delayed drilling of additional development wells and production limitations. Revised Earnings Guidance Anadarko expects current commodity prices for oil and gas to more than offset the effect of the reduced sales volumes. As a result, 2003 earnings and cash flow are now expected to be higher than the company's previous guidance. Anadarko expects to earn $311 million, or $1.24 per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2003, with expected cash flow from operating activities of $740 million. That compares with the previous estimates of $1.15 per share (diluted) of earnings and cash flow from operating activities of $710 million. The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 252 million. For the full year, the company expects earnings of about $1.46 billion, or $5.77 per share (diluted), and cash flow from operating activities of about $3.24 billion. That compares with the previous estimates of $1.39 billion, or $5.51 per share (diluted) of earnings and cash flow from operating activities of $3.16 billion. The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 253 million. Anadarko's revised 2003 estimates assume average NYMEX oil prices of $28.75 per barrel for the second quarter, with a full-year average price of $29.25 per barrel. The company's NYMEX natural gas price estimate is $5.40 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) for the second quarter, with a full-year average price of $6 per Mcf. These prices are somewhat lower than recent published prices. See the attached financial tables for price and volume assumptions. Capital Program "Based on these prices and our current $2.5 billion capital budget, we expect to have about $600 million of free cash flow, after dividends," Allison said. "We plan to spend just over $200 million on a property acquisition that will be announced shortly, which will add production and cash flow this year and has excellent payout and margins. These volumes are not included in the new guidance. "We also plan to reduce debt by at least $300 million this year, and we will consider additional debt retirement and share repurchases with the remaining cash flow. "Increased drilling activity and additional property acquisitions also remain options," he noted, "but we are not quite ready to commit additional capital this year. We are going to remain disciplined on both sides of the ball, investing wisely while managing costs prudently."
