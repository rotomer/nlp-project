ANNUAL PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF 192 MILLION BOE REAFFIRMED
$300 MILLION IN ANTICIPATED DEBT REDUCTION
CUTTING $100 MILLION IN ANNUAL OVERHEAD & OTHER COSTS
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC
-
News) today announced second quarter 2003 net income available to common shareholders of $301 million, or $1.20 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.28 billion. For the same period in 2002, the company earned $239 million, or 93 cents per share (diluted), on revenues of $1 billion.
Cash flow from operating activities totaled $710 million in the second quarter of 2003, compared with $543 million in the same period in 2002. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities totaled $774 million in the second quarter of 2003 compared to $561 million during the same quarter last year. (1)
The company's second quarter earnings include the effect of several items that were not included in the second quarter guidance. These amounts primarily relate to impairments of oil and gas properties of $13 million ($9 million after taxes) and accounting for derivative losses of $29 million ($19 million after taxes).
Year-over-year increases in earnings and cash flow were due to higher commodity prices. The gains were partly offset by lower sales volumes of oil and gas, mainly due to the 2002 divestitures of Canadian heavy oil properties and operational issues in the Gulf of Mexico and Qatar during the second quarter.
"Commodity prices were strong in the second quarter and we showed good production growth compared to the first quarter," said Robert J. Allison, Jr., Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO.
"Going forward, we've announced an aggressive plan to cut costs that I believe sets Anadarko on a road of improved financial discipline and increased shareholder value," Allison added. "We're taking a hard look at every dollar we spend and where we spend it. This increased focus will allow us to be more efficient at reinvesting capital and managing the portfolio, which should give us better margins and returns. Anadarko is a financially strong company with excellent growth opportunities. We've grown dramatically in the past decade with a balanced strategy of exploration and development drilling, supplemented with tactical property acquisitions. Now, we're building on this strategy with several financial initiatives -- such as cutting overhead and planned debt reduction -- all of which should improve our ability to build shareholder value with our core business strategies."
Sales volumes totaled 48 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) during the second quarter of 2003, or 527,000 BOE per day, up nearly 6 percent from the first quarter of 2003. In the second quarter of 2002, sales volumes were 50 million BOE, or 546,000 BOE per day.
"We saw strong growth in gas production compared with the first quarter from several areas, including the Vernon and Bossier plays in the Lower 48, from the Gulf of Mexico and Canada," Allison said. "Quarter-to-quarter growth in oil production came mainly from increases in the Ourhoud field in Algeria, Venezuela and in the Gulf of Mexico."
Natural gas volumes in the second quarter of 2003 were 1.74 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, compared with 1.71 Bcf per day in the first quarter of 2003. Gas sales in the second quarter of 2002 totaled 1.79 Bcf per day. Anadarko's realized average natural gas price in the second quarter of 2003 was $4.54 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), compared with $3.05 per Mcf in the same period in 2002.
Oil production in the second quarter of 2003 was 190,000 barrels a day, up from 173,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of 2003. Oil sales in the second quarter of 2002 totaled 205,000 barrels per day. The company's realized oil price averaged $25.41 per barrel in the second quarter of this year, compared with $22.57 per barrel in the second quarter of 2002.
SECOND-QUARTER 2003 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
Onshore, the company drilled a potentially significant gas well in the deep Woodbine play in Texas. The Blackstone Minerals A-249 well had encouraging shows of natural gas. Well testing is scheduled to begin in the third quarter. Anadarko holds a 100 percent working interest in this well.
Gross production from the Vernon play in North Louisiana increased from an average 120 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas per day in the first quarter to 180 MMcf per day currently following a step-up in development drilling. Eight Vernon wells with initial production of more than 10 MMcf per day each were completed during the quarter. In the Bossier play in East Texas, gross production increased from an average 245 MMcf of gas a day in the first quarter to 300 MMcf a day currently.
Anadarko and its partners drilled another successful appraisal well at the K2 Gulf of Mexico deepwater discovery on Green Canyon Block 562. Results from this subsalt well suggest the reserve potential could be larger than originally estimated. The company also has an exploration well under way at Green Canyon Block 518 immediately north of the K2 field to test the possible northern extension of the K2 field. Anadarko holds a 100 percent working interest in this block.
Anadarko made its second natural gas discovery in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico at the deepwater Atlas prospect on Lloyd Ridge Block 50. The company is finalizing plans to drill a delineation well at the Jubilee discovery later this year. Anadarko holds a 100 percent working interest in Atlas and Jubilee. In addition, Anadarko will drill a new exploration prospect in the area this year.
In the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko acquired shelf properties from Amerada Hess with proved reserves of nearly 23 million BOE for $225 million. They are expected to add 2.4 million BOE to Anadarko's 2003 volumes. Existing production has been hedged through 2007. This should generate cash margins after operating costs of at least $21 per BOE.
CAPITAL BUDGET & DEBT REDUCTION
Based on current expectations for NYMEX prices of oil and gas, Anadarko will maintain its 2003 capital budget of $2.7 billion and reduce debt this year by $300 million. The $2.7 billion includes the previously announced capital spending budget of $2.5 billion, plus the $225 million acquisition of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico in June.
PRODUCTION & EARNINGS GUIDANCE
"Anadarko's current production guidance remains 192 million BOE for 2003, and we now expect production growth in 2004 to be between 4 and 10 percent, assuming there are no OPEC constraints," Allison said. "With a greater focus on financial discipline and capital allocation, we expect to set the capital expenditure budget below cash flow expectations for 2004 also. As a result of the lower spending, as well as more conservative forecasting to allow for unexpected production interruptions, our 2004 volume target has been reduced from earlier estimates, but still indicates a very competitive growth rate."
Anadarko expects to earn $285 million, or $1.13 per share (diluted) for the third quarter of 2003, with expected cash flow from operating activities of $755 million. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the third quarter of 2003 is expected to be $730 million.(1) The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 251 million.
For the full year, the company expects earnings of $1.3 billion, or $5.17 per share (diluted) and cash flow from operating activities of $2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the full year 2003 is expected to be $3.1 billion.(1) The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 253 million.
"We've trimmed our estimates a little to reflect softening NYMEX futures prices, particularly for natural gas, where the forward-month strip has declined by over 20 percent over the last six weeks," Allison said.
PRICE ASSUMPTIONS
Anadarko's 2003 estimates now assume average NYMEX oil prices of $29 per barrel for the third quarter, and $27.40 per barrel for the remainder of the year, with a full-year average of $29.80 per barrel. The company's NYMEX natural gas price estimate is $4.75 per Mcf for the third quarter, and $4.85 per Mcf for the remainder of the year, with a full-year average of $5.40 per Mcf.
To determine realized prices, Anadarko used these estimates, plus or minus an expected price differential for each of the company's major producing areas, and any adjustment for hedge positions.
For 2003, Anadarko has hedged approximately 52 percent of its natural gas production for the third quarter and 51 percent for the fourth quarter. About 36 percent of Anadarko's oil production is hedged in the second half of 2003. The hedge positions are under both fixed-price transactions and collared transactions, which use price ceilings and floors to help ensure sales prices within a determined range.
VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS
Oil and gas sales volumes are expected to total 49 million BOE in the third quarter. Full-year 2003 sales volumes are expected to total 192 million BOE.

Three pages of summary financial data for the second quarter of 2003 follow. There is also a page with detailed financial guidance for the third quarter and full year and a summary of the company's current hedge positions for the remainder of 2003 and 2004.

Anadarko Cuts over $100 Million in Annual Overhead Costs

News)                                                                            
Reducing staff by about 400 positions
Closing offices in Midland & Amarillo, Texas
Focus spending on finding & producing oil and natural gas
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC
-
News) announced a cost reduction plan today that will eliminate more than $100 million, or 15 percent, in total overhead costs from the company's annual cost structure.
The $100 million in cost reductions includes cuts in two basic areas: personnel and corporate expenses.
Approximately 400 positions are being eliminated including employees and contractors. In addition, the company will be eliminating unfilled, or open, positions. Personnel cuts represent about 50 percent of the savings.
The remaining $50 million in cuts include across-the-board reductions in general overhead, closing offices in Midland and Amarillo, Texas and consolidating office space at the company's headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas.
"Anadarko is a financially strong company with high-quality assets in North America and internationally which offer excellent prospects for future growth. However, our cost structure is too high and we're taking action now to cut costs and be more competitive," said Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO Robert J. Allison, Jr. "The decision to reduce staff is a difficult, but necessary step in order to make Anadarko a leaner, stronger and more efficient company. This company can continue to grow profitably because we're redeploying our people to focus on our highest value exploration and production opportunities.
"We have eliminated both staff and management positions and have significantly reduced our costs," Allison added. "These initiatives are an important step in an ongoing effort to improve operating and financial performance and control costs. Our shareholders expect us to operate as efficiently as possible and we are committed to increasing shareholder value and making Anadarko the premier independent exploration and production company."
One time costs will be approximately $40 million, or $25 million after taxes. These costs will be charged to income as specific liabilities are incurred. It is estimated that $35 million, or $22 million after taxes, will be reflected in third quarter results.
The company will now have approximately 3,400 full-time employees worldwide. The affected employees have been notified and the vast majority of the reductions will take effect immediately. Of the 400 positions eliminated, approximately 70 percent were from departments supporting the company's exploration and production (E&P) efforts and 30 percent were in E&P.
In conjunction with this initiative, the following executive officers have elected to retire: Mike Cochran, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Planning; Bruce Stover, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Business Development; and Paul Taylor, Vice President, Investor Relations. In addition, Bill Sullivan, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production, and Rex Alman, Senior Vice President, Algeria, have elected to resign.
Company offices in Midland and Amarillo, Texas will be closed in a move that will generate cost savings and will also allow the company to consolidate and reallocate some personnel.
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is one of the world's largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies. Houston-based Anadarko is active in the U.S., Canada, Algeria, Qatar and Venezuela and is executing strategic exploration programs in several other countries.
