Exhibit 99 Anadarko Petroleum Announces Third-Quarter Earnings HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 31, 2003--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) -- APC Headed for Record Annual Earnings -- Company Reports Net Income of $1.09 Per Share; or $1.46 Per Share Excluding Impairments and Restructuring Costs(1) Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced third quarter 2003 net income available to common shareholders of $274 million, or $1.09 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.3 billion. For the same period in 2002, the company earned $189 million, or 74 cents per share (diluted), on revenues of $938 million. Net income for the third quarter 2003 excluding the effect of foreign oil and gas impairments and restructuring costs related to the company's cost reduction plan was $1.46 per share (diluted).(1) Cash flow from operating activities totaled $884 million in the third quarter of 2003, up 63 percent from $544 million in the same period in 2002. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the third quarter totaled $868 million, compared with $539 million for the same quarter in 2002.(1) "Our solid performance the past several quarters puts Anadarko on track to achieve record earnings this year," said Robert J. Allison, Jr., Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. "We're making significant progress on cutting overhead costs. We've made new discoveries this quarter in Algeria and we're encouraged by the recent results of our exploration program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, our U.S. onshore bread-and-butter plays, such as the Bossier trend in East Texas and North Louisiana, continue to deliver impressive results quarter to quarter. We're also seeing promising results from new onshore plays such as the deep Haley trend in West Texas and from the redevelopment of some Gulf of Mexico properties. "Based on these successes, Anadarko is now expecting greater improvement in its finding and development costs -- which we expect to be better than $7.50 per barrel for the year. That number is lower than our previous guidance, and a significant improvement over last year," Allison added. Sales volumes totaled 50 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) during the third quarter of 2003, or 541,000 BOE per day, up nearly 3 percent from the second quarter 2003. In the third quarter of 2002, sales volumes were 48 million BOE, or 526,000 BOE per day. Natural gas volumes in the third quarter of 2003 were 1.84 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, compared with 1.74 Bcf per day in the second quarter of 2003. A year ago, natural gas volumes for the third quarter were 1.76 Bcf per day. Anadarko's realized average natural gas price in the third quarter of 2003 was $4.51 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), compared with $2.62 per Mcf in the same period in 2002. Oil production in the third quarter of 2003 was 189,000 barrels a day, down slightly from 190,000 barrels a day in the second quarter of 2003 and 191,000 in the third quarter of 2002. Anadarko's realized oil price averaged $26.36 per barrel in the third quarter of this year, compared with $24.02 per barrel in the third quarter of 2002. THIRD-QUARTER 2003 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- Anadarko and its partners have made their third and fourth exploration successes in the past 12 months in Algeria's prolific Berkine Basin. The most recent discovery, the BKNE-AAC-A well, is located in Block 404 and was drilled to a depth of 11,200 feet and encountered 36 net feet of oil pay. -- In Wyoming, construction is progressing on a 125-mile pipeline to transport carbon dioxide (CO2) recovered from the Shute Creek gas processing plant in southwest Wyoming to Anadarko's enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project at the Salt Creek field north of Casper. The pipeline construction should be complete by January. Anadarko's successful pilot program has generated encouraging results and confirms the expected EOR performance to increase oil production over the next several years from 5,300 barrels per day to a peak rate of 35,000 barrels per day. CAPITAL BUDGET Anadarko will increase its 2003 capital budget by $100 million, based on improved NYMEX prices of oil and gas, and remains committed to reducing debt this year by $300 million. The increased capital budget of $2.8 billion will allow the company to spend additional funds to advance the development of several successful programs such as the East Texas Bossier and North Louisiana Vernon plays, and conduct further delineation at some deepwater Gulf of Mexico discoveries. PRODUCTION & EARNINGS GUIDANCE Oil and gas sales volumes are expected to total 49 million BOE in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2003 sales volumes are expected to total 192 million BOE. The company expects net income of $275 million, or $1.10 per share (diluted), for the fourth quarter of 2003, with expected cash flow from operating activities of $760 million. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2003 is expected to be $780 million.(1) The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 251 million. For the full year, the company expects earnings of $1.3 billion, or $5 per share (diluted) and cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the full year 2003 is expected to be $3.2 billion.(1) The expected average number of diluted shares outstanding is 253 million.

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Anadarko believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that its goals will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this release.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures Below is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (GAAP) to net income available to common stockholders before the after tax effect of impairments related to oil and gas properties and restructuring costs (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company uses net income excluding non-cash impairments and restructuring costs to evaluate the company's results. Impairments and restructuring costs related to the company's cost reduction plan are excluded due to the lack of comparability between periods.

The company uses cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities to demonstrate the company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities.
