Exhibit 99.1 Anadarko Announces Fourth-Quarter and 2003 Financial and Operating Results HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2004--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) -- RECORD EARNINGS OF $1.3 BILLION FOR 2003 -- EXCELLENT F&D COSTS OF $6.95 PER BOE -- RESERVE REPLACEMENT RATE OF NEARLY 200% -- RESERVE GROWTH OF 8% Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 financial results, as well as operating results from oil and natural gas activities worldwide. "Anadarko had a good year," said Jim Hackett, Anadarko president and CEO. "We intensified our focus on the basics of finding high-value oil and natural gas reserves and we accomplished that with excellent finding and development costs of $6.95 per BOE. Plus, we achieved record earnings and more than replaced annual production with new reserves for the 22nd consecutive year." FOURTH QUARTER 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS For the fourth quarter of 2003, Anadarko reported net income available to common shareholders of $294 million, or $1.17 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.28 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $309 million, or $1.21 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.12 billion. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $744 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $691 million for the fourth quarter 2002. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2003 totaled $728 million, compared with $713 million for the fourth quarter in 2002.(1) Sales volumes for the fourth quarter totaled 49 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), flat compared to the same quarter of 2002. FULL YEAR 2003 FINANCIAL RESULTS Anadarko reported full-year 2003 net income available to common shareholders of $1.29 billion, or $5.09 per share (diluted), on revenues of $5.12 billion. This compares to 2002 net income of $825 million, or $3.21 per share (diluted), on revenues of $3.85 billion. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $3.04 billion in 2003, up 39 percent from $2.20 billion in 2002. Cash flow from 2003 operations before changes in assets and liabilities totaled $3.16 billion, compared with $2.21 billion in 2002.(1) "Anadarko delivered on its promise to maintain capital discipline throughout 2003," Hackett added. "We committed to pay down $300 million in debt and actually reduced debt by over $400 million last year. At the same time, we increased reserves by 8 percent at a very competitive cost, translating directly into increased value for shareholders." Sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids for 2003 totaled 192 million BOE, meeting the company's guidance. Volumes for 2002 were 197 million BOE, which included seven million BOE related to properties that were sold in 2002. FINDING & DEVELOPMENT COSTS Anadarko's 2003 total worldwide finding and development costs (F&D) for proved reserves averaged $6.95 per BOE, reflecting costs of additions from drilling, property acquisitions and the effect of reserve revisions.(2) "Anadarko delivered excellent finding costs -- particularly in the U.S.," Hackett said. "Our land position and exploitation expertise delivered F&D costs in the onshore Lower 48 of just $4.37 per BOE in 2003." RESERVE REPLACEMENT Anadarko's worldwide reserve replacement rate from all sources was nearly 200 percent of annual production, with 377 million BOE of net reserves added. This is the 22nd consecutive year that Anadarko has more than replaced annual production with new proved reserves. The net reserve adds include the effect of changes from all sources -- drilling, producing property acquisitions and divestitures, and revisions to earlier estimates. "I am confident about Anadarko's proved reserve numbers," stated Hackett. "Every year, we review every well on every property in every field, and we believe our internal reviews of those reserves are solid. As an added measure of discipline, early in 2003 we hired an outside reserve engineering consultant -- Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. -- to serve as a member of our internal reserve review team. We charged them with reviewing the processes, procedures and resulting estimates of our 2003 bookings. As a result, they reviewed 70 percent of our 2003 reserve additions and approximately 50 percent of existing proved reserves. We have received their letter of confidence in both our process and the reasonableness of our numbers." The Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. letter of confidence is provided as an attachment to this document. PROVED RESERVES Anadarko increased proved reserves worldwide by 8 percent to 2.5 billion BOE at year-end 2003 from 2.3 billion BOE at year-end 2002. In 2003, the company also cost-effectively converted a significant number of proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves, which increased proved developed reserves from 67 percent to 69 percent of total worldwide reserves. "Proved undeveloped reserves, or PUDs, represent the future of a growing company. So we continue to pay close attention to booked PUD reserves. We know the length of time each PUD remains on our books as undeveloped and have an action plan for developing all of them," Hackett explained. Domestic reserves rose 12 percent to 1.7 billion BOE, representing 68 percent of the company's worldwide reserves. The primary growth areas are the Gulf of Mexico, North Louisiana Vernon field, the Carthage and Austin Chalk fields in Texas, and the Wyoming Salt Creek enhanced oil recovery project. Canadian proved reserves increased 9 percent, totaling 314 million BOE, representing over 12 percent of total worldwide reserves. Anadarko's proved reserves remain nearly balanced between natural gas (51 percent) and crude oil, condensate and liquids (49 percent). Proved reserves of oil and liquids totaled 1.2 billion barrels at year-end 2003, representing an 8 percent increase from the previous year. Proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2003 totaled 7.7 trillion cubic feet, also up 8 percent from the previous year. Ninety-eight percent of the company's proved natural gas reserves are located in the U.S. and Canada. Acquisitions of producing properties primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and Wyoming added 54 million BOE of reserves in 2003. Divestitures of non-core properties in the U.S. and Canada totaled 14 million BOE of reserves. FOURTH QUARTER 2003 OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS -- During the fourth quarter, Anadarko Canada achieved the highest natural gas production levels in its history. Among the factors contributing to this record is the completion of a major expansion of the Wild River gas plant (APC 100%) that lifted gas capacity to a total of 79 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d), which is already being utilized. An additional 4 MMcf/d of capacity is expected to be added in the first quarter of 2004. Development drilling success continues to drive plant capacity planning for the future. -- The company drilled its first well on the Gulf of Mexico properties acquired from Amerada Hess in June 2003. The South Timbalier 166 E-4 well encountered 203 feet of net pay. Anadarko holds a 60 percent working interest in the well. -- Anadarko made a deepwater oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico at Green Canyon Block 518. The well, just north of Anadarko's K2 discovery, significantly extends the boundaries of the K2 field northward. Production will be fast tracked through a sub-sea tieback to the Marco Polo platform, which was successfully installed in January. -- Anadarko and its partners made a deepwater natural gas discovery at the Spiderman prospect in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Spiderman is Anadarko's third Eastern Gulf discovery during 2003, and was followed by a modest satellite discovery this month, Atlas Northwest. -- In the Vernon field in North Louisiana, natural gas production averaged 195 MMcf/d in the fourth quarter, up from about 117 MMcf/d in the first quarter of 2003. -- Anadarko completed construction of a 16-inch, 125-mile pipeline that recently began transporting carbon dioxide (CO2) across Wyoming to the Salt Creek oil field north of Casper. This enhanced oil recovery project is expected to increase net production from 5,000 barrels per day to a peak rate of 32,000 barrels per day over the next several years.

ANADARKO OPERATIONS REPORT A comprehensive fourth-quarter 2003 operations report will be posted today on the company's Web site: www.anadarko.com. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is one of the world's largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies. Houston-based Anadarko is active in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and Qatar and is executing strategic exploration programs in several other countries. More information is available at www.anadarko.com. (1) See accompanying table for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures utilized in calculating cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities and statements indicating why management believes the non-GAAP measure of cash flow is useful information for investors. (2) F&D costs per BOE exclude the effect of asset retirement costs and include actual asset retirement expenditures which is consistent with prior years' method of calculation. This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Anadarko believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that its goals will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this release. While Anadarko makes these forward-looking statements in good faith, neither Anadarko nor its management can guarantee that the anticipated future results will be achieved. Anadarko discloses proved reserves that comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) definitions. Additionally, Anadarko may disclose estimated reserves, which the SEC guidelines do not allow us to include in filings with the SEC. See Additional Factors Affecting Business in the Management's Discussion and Analysis included in the company's 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures Below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company uses cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities to demonstrate the company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities.

NSAI Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. Worldwide Petroleum Consultants 4500 Thanksgiving Tower - 1601 Elm Street, Dallas, TX 75201-4754 1221 Lamar Street, Suite 1200, Houston, TX 77010-3072 January 21, 2004 Mr. Randall L. Couch Anadarko Petroleum Corporation 1201 Lake Robbins Drive The Woodlands, Texas 77380 Dear Mr. Couch: In accordance with your request, we have completed a review of the procedures and methods used by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) in preparing its estimates of proved reserves and future revenue for certain oil and gas properties, as of December 31, 2003. These reserve and future revenue estimates were prepared by Anadarko's internal technical staff. The opinions expressed herein are based on our involvement as a member of Anadarko's Reserve Review Team and our exposure to Anadarko's reserve estimating process. As a member of the Reserve Review Team, we met with Anadarko personnel and reviewed the geologic and engineering methodologies used as well as the resulting reserve estimates prepared by Anadarko for certain fields identified by designated screening criteria. In total, 10 separate reserve review meetings were conducted in Anadarko's offices in The Woodlands, Texas; Calgary, Alberta; and Uxbridge, England. The meetings ranged in duration from 2 to 7 hours each. The United States properties reviewed included the Vernon Field Area located in Louisiana; the Marco Polo/K2 Prospect and the major Hess Acquisition properties in the Gulf of Mexico; the Carthage Field Area, the Haley Field, and the Austin Chalk properties in Texas; and the Monell Unit and the Salt Creek Field in Wyoming. In Canada, the top 10 field areas and other significant properties were reviewed comprising approximately 80 percent of Anadarko's reserves in Canada. For Algeria, we received an overview of Anadarko's concession as well as a detailed technical review of the HBNS Field, the largest of the producing fields in Algeria. We also reviewed the key provisions of the services contract for the Oritupano-Leona Block in Venezuela. It is our understanding that the properties reviewed represent approximately 50 percent of the total proved reserves of Anadarko; and, that in the course of these meetings we reviewed approximately 70 percent of the 2003 projected reserve additions. The goal of this review was to verify that the reserve estimates were prepared in accordance with the guidelines and definitions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) using generally accepted engineering and evaluation principles; and to determine, for the properties reviewed, the reasonableness of Anadarko's methods, procedures, and estimates. The reviews focused on the reserve determination methodologies and the data used in preparing these estimates. The available data reviewed included, but were not limited to, seismic data, structure and isopach maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data, individual well and field projections, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs, and product prices. The reviews were sufficient to determine that the general methods and procedures used by Anadarko in the reserve estimation process are reasonable. In our opinion, the estimates for those properties reviewed appear reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with SEC guidelines and definitions using generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles. It should be understood that this is a review of procedures, methods, and certain internal estimates only and does not constitute a complete review, study, or audit of Anadarko's estimated proved reserves and future revenue. We did not consider Anadarko's probable or possible estimates in this procedural review. We made no verification of the accuracy and completeness of the information and data provided by Anadarko with respect to ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, reservoir pressures, oil and gas prices, and operating and development costs.

Exhibit 99.2 Anadarko Issues 2004 Production & Financial Guidance HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2004--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) announced today that it will submit its 2004 financial and operating plans to its Board of Directors on Feb. 5. Details of the budget, including allocations for specific exploration and development operations, will be announced Feb. 6. The company expects to implement 2004 capital spending in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, based on actual prices of oil and natural gas and cash flow. Based on these projections, oil and natural gas sales volumes are expected to grow 1 to 4 percent in 2004 over 2003's volumes of 192 million barrels of oil equivalent. The company's previous guidance was for 4 to 10 percent production growth in 2004. A delay in forecasted production from the company's deepwater Marco Polo project, caused by weather, reduced the range by two to three percentage points. The remaining smaller reduction is attributable to prudent operational risk adjustments and capital budget allocations. "We feel we have properly accounted for risks that are inherent to our producing properties, such as hurricanes and other weather delays, as well as other operational issues. There has been no real change in our decline rates or the performance of our existing assets. Rather, we are forecasting a range of production growth that incorporates the potential impact of myriad unexpected operational issues, giving us confidence in our ability to meet expectations," said Jim Hackett, Anadarko president and CEO. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is one of the world's largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies. Houston-based Anadarko is active in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and Qatar and is executing strategic exploration programs in several other countries. More information is available at www.anadarko.com.
