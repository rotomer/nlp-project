Exhibit 99 Anadarko Announces Strong First Quarter 2004 Earnings HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 30, 2004--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced first quarter 2004 net income available to common shareholders of $392 million, or $1.55 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.46 billion. Net income included a $40 million after-tax charge for an operating lease settlement related to a former UPR-owned refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. Net income excluding this charge was $1.70 per share (diluted).(1) For the same period in 2003, net income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was $371 million, or $1.45 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.26 billion. Including the accounting change, net income was $418 million, or $1.63 per share (diluted), in the 2003 first quarter. "Strong volumes and favorable variances on expenses compared to our guidance, in addition to robust commodity prices, have us on track to deliver on the performance metrics we've laid out for shareholders this year," said Anadarko President and CEO Jim Hackett. "The resulting income and cash flows are providing the ability to fund our active capital program, improve returns, strengthen our balance sheet and achieve year-over-year growth." Cash flow from operating activities totaled $885 million in the first quarter 2004, compared to $705 million for the first quarter 2003. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the first quarter 2004 totaled $944 million, compared to $794 million for the first quarter 2003.(1) During the first quarter of 2004, sales volumes totaled 49 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), or 538,000 BOE per day, up 8 percent from 2003 first quarter sales volumes of 498,000 BOE per day. Oil sales volumes in the first quarter were 202,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared to 173,000 bpd in the same quarter of 2003. The 17 percent increase is mainly attributed to the company's Algerian operations, due to the timing of cargo liftings and the expansion of production facilities and infrastructure. The company's average realized oil prices were $29.94 per barrel, compared with 2003 first quarter prices of $28.64 per barrel. North American natural gas sales volumes of 1,723 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day rose 1 percent from first quarter 2003 volumes of 1,705 MMcf per day. Anadarko's average realized natural gas price in the first quarter of 2004 was $4.92 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), compared with $4.60 per Mcf for the same period in 2003. EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL TODAY AT 9:30 A.M. CDT, 10:30 A.M. EDT Anadarko will host an earnings conference call today at 9:30 a.m. Central Daylight Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss first quarter 2004 results and the company's outlook for the remainder of the year.

(1) See accompanying tables for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures utilized in calculating net income excluding the operating lease settlement charge, cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities and statements indicating why management believes the non-GAAP measures of net income and cash flow are useful information for investors. This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Anadarko believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that its goals will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this release. While Anadarko makes these forward-looking statements in good faith, neither Anadarko nor its management can guarantee that the anticipated future results will be achieved.

FINANCIAL DATA Seven pages of summary financial data follow, including current hedge positions and guidance. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures Below is a reconciliation of net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (GAAP) to net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and operating lease settlement charge (non-GAAP) related to a former UPR-owned refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company uses net income before change in accounting principle excluding the operating lease settlement charge, included in other (income) expense, to evaluate the company's results from current operations. The operating lease settlement charge net of income taxes is excluded due to the lack of comparability between periods.

The company uses cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities to demonstrate the company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities.
