Exhibit 99.1 Anadarko Announces 2005 Budget HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 19, 2004--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) -- ANTICIPATE 7-11% VOLUME GROWTH IN 2005 -- CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $2.9 BILLION - $3.1 BILLION -- INCREASE IN EXPLORATION SPENDING TO SUSTAIN GROWTH Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a 2005 budget in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. The program is expected to deliver 7 to 11 percent production volume growth in 2005, or 160 million to 165 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), over 2004 pro forma(a) performance of 148 million to 151 million BOE. It also includes increased spending on exploration to sustain volume growth beyond the next five years. "Anadarko expects to achieve sustainable, profitable growth by leveraging our skill sets on the things we do well - developing unconventional resources and exploring in high-potential basins - while regularly high-grading our portfolio and maintaining financial discipline," said Jim Hackett, Anadarko President and CEO. Anadarko has implemented a refocused strategy, presented in June, by balancing the portfolio through announced asset sales totaling $3.3 billion, repurchasing 12.9 million outstanding shares at a cost of $819 million and retiring about $1.2 billion of debt. "Our 2005 capital budget is essentially unchanged from 2004 capital expenditures, despite the asset divestitures," Hackett said. "That's largely because we decided to exercise the strategic option to accelerate drilling certain PUDs - or proven undeveloped locations - primarily on our low-risk North American unconventional gas properties. This $200 million program is designed to capitalize on today's high commodity price environment, adding about $150 million of net asset value with a payback period of just over two years, while increasing our 2005 production volume growth by about 2.5 million BOE. In addition, while we intend to drive down costs where possible, we have budgeted $400 million for potential increases in oil field services and materials." Approximately 64 percent of the total budget is planned for development activities, 25 percent will go to exploration and the remaining 11 percent is set aside for capitalized interest, overhead and other items. Development spending to generate volume growth in 2005 will focus on Anadarko's continued success in unconventional tight gas plays in the Vernon field in North Louisiana and Wild River in Alberta, Canada, and on delineating new plays in Texas and Louisiana. Production will continue to ramp up at the company's enhanced oil recovery operations at the Salt Creek and Monell fields in Wyoming. In the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Anadarko will focus on delineation drilling and facilities installation in the deepwater at K2, K2 North and the Eastern GOM, which are expected to be significant contributors to the company's volume growth through 2008. In Alaska, we're expanding the Alpine facility to increase capacity. Venezuela is expected to generate good volume growth in 2005. In Algeria, the company expects to make significant progress on the development of Block 208 discoveries, with the new production facilities scheduled to come on-line in 2007. "As always, exploration is a cornerstone of Anadarko's strategy and we intend to carry that commitment forward in 2005 by allocating a quarter of our capital budget to find new sources of energy for the world's needs," Hackett said. The exploration budget will focus on a number of key areas in the deepwater GOM, including prospects such as Genghis Khan, Knotty Head and Mondo Northwest in the Eastern GOM. In addition, the company will explore for deep gas objectives in the onshore U.S. and Canada. International exploration will focus on drilling programs in Algeria, Qatar, Tunisia and Indonesia, as well as activities within our targeted new venture areas. 2005 CAPITAL BUDGET BY TYPE 2005 CAPITAL BUDGET BY AREA Tight Gas 34% U.S. Onshore 46% Deepwater GOM 23% Deepwater GOM 23% Enhanced Oil Recovery 6% Canada 13% Conventional E&P 12% International 9% Fractured Reservoirs 5% Corporate 9% Coalbed Methane 2% International 9% Corporate 9% The company's capital program is expected to more than replace annual production for the 24th consecutive year and increase proved reserves by 4 percent to 7 percent in 2005. Finding and development (F&D) costs for 2005 are expected to be between $9 and $12 per BOE. "With commodity prices substantially above mid-cycle levels, we expect F&D costs to be higher. But more importantly, our cash margins have risen more than F&D costs, so returns have improved significantly. We expect a reserve replacement of 150 percent to 200 percent and a reserve replacement efficiency of 1.8 to 2.2," Hackett said. "So, in this price environment it makes perfect sense to accelerate development projects to get volumes on-line sooner, even if these strategic decisions drive up a single-point metric such as F&D."
