Item 8.01 Other Events
 
a case filed in the 82nd Judicial District Court of Robertson County, Texas, involves a dispute regarding a confidentiality agreement that Anadarko executed in August 1999. On January 28, 2004, based upon a jury verdict, the court entered a $145 million judgment in favor of the plaintiff as follows: $40 million in actual damages; $100 million in punitive damages; and, $5 million in pre-judgment interest. The court later signed an Amended Final Judgment on April 14, 2004, which reduced the punitive damages to $80 million reducing the total judgment to approximately $125 million. Anadarko appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the 10th District of Texas at Waco. The Company believed that it had strong arguments for a reversal on appeal and that it was not probable that the judgment would be affirmed. As of December 30, 2004, the parties executed a Settlement and Release Agreement to resolve all disputes for approxima tely $38 million. As a result of the settlement, the parties have requested that the Amended Final Judgment be vacated and will request that the litigation be dismissed. Financial results for 2004 will include a charge of $24 million after income taxes or $0.10 per share (diluted) related to this settlement.
