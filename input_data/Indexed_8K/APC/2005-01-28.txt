Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement (a) On January 25, 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") approved the award of special cash bonuses to its executive officers related to the performance of services in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004. These bonuses were awarded to the following named executive officers of the Company in the amounts set forth below: Amount of Name and Title Special Bonus -------------------------------------------------------------------------- James T. Hackett President and Chief Executive Officer $165,000 James R. Larson Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer $71,250 Robert P. Daniels Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production $63,750 Mark L. Pease Senior Vice President, Exploration and Production $63,750 Robert K. Reeves Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Law $60,000 An aggregate amount of $240,450 in special cash bonuses was also awarded to nine other executive officers of the Company. The special cash bonus amounts were awarded in addition to bonuses awarded pursuant to the Company's Annual Incentive Bonus plan, under which awards are based on the Company's overall performance of specified operational, financial and safety performance goals. In determining these special cash bonus awards, the Compensation Committee recognized the unique demands placed on these individuals in 2004 and their significant contributions to the effective development of a refocused strategy, including an overwhelmingly successful asset divestiture program that was introduced and substantially completed during 2004, the successful execution of a debt reduction and stock repurchase program and their instrumental influence in leading cultural changes throughout the organization. (b) On January 25, 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to the terms of the Company's executive officers and non-executive officers form of stock option agreements ("Agreement") under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. The amendment provides for the immediate vesting of unvested stock options in the event the executive officer or non-executive officer terminates employment on account of disability. Such amendment is consistent with market competitive practices and similar treatment for other equity-based awards under the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. Copies of the forms of Agreements are attached as Exhibit 10.1 and 10.2 to this Form 8-K.

Exhibit 10.1 January 2005 ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION EXECUTIVE 1999 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT (Seven-Year Term) 1. To the extent that the right to exercise Options has accrued hereunder, the Options, or any part thereof, may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with the Corporate Secretary of the Company at its corporate headquarters. Such notice shall be in the form specified by the Committee. If no form has been specified, such notice shall specify the number of Options that the Participant wants to exercise and the method of exercise. Payments of all amounts due shall be made by check payable to the Company. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee before an Option is exercised: (i) all or a portion of the Exercise Price may be paid by delivery of Mature Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; and (ii) the Participant may pay the Exercise Price by authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion of the Shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise. No Shares shall be issued or delivered until full payment therefor has been made. 2. The Options may not be exercised unless the Participant is at the time of such exercise an employee of the Company, or an Affiliate, and shall have been continuously employed by the Company, or an Affiliate, since the date the Options were granted; provided, however, that the Options shall be exercisable following the termination of the Participant's employment during the term of the Options as provided in sections (i) through (iv) below. Options, which are not and do not become exercisable at the time of the Participants termination of employment shall, coincident therewith, terminate and be of no further force or effect. (i) Retirement. If the Participant shall cease to be an employee of the Company, or an Affiliate, by reason of retirement pursuant to a pension or retirement plan of the Company, or of a subsidiary, the Participant (or, in the event of Participant's death, the Participant's legal representative) may, within a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of cessation of employment, exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable on the date of cessation. In no event may the Options be exercised more than seven (7) years from the date of grant. (ii) Death or Disability of Participant. In the event of the death of the Participant while an active employee of the Company, or an Affiliate, or if the Participant shall cease to be an employee of the Company, or an Affiliate, by reason of total disability, as defined in the Company's Disability Plan, any outstanding Options granted to the Participant shall vest and be immediately
exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised. In the event of the death of the Participant, the Participant's legal representative or other person or persons to whom the Participant's rights under the Options shall pass by the Participant's will or the laws of descent and distribution, may, within a period of not more than twelve (12) months after the date of death, exercise the Options. In the event of the total disability of the Participant, the Participant (or, in the event of Participant's death, the Participant's legal representative) may, within a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of cessation of employment, exercise the Options. In no event may the Options be exercised more than seven (7) years from the date of grant. (iii) Termination Without Cause. If the Participant's employment with the Company, or an Affiliate, is terminated by the Company or an Affiliate due to a reduction in force, job abolishment, or at the convenience of the Company, or an Affiliate as determined by the Committee, the Participant (or, in the event of the Participant's death, the Participant's legal representative) may, within a period of not more than three (3) months after such cessation of employment, exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable at the date of such cessation. In no event may the Options be exercised more than seven (7) years from the date of grant. (iv) Termination following Change of Control. If the Participant's employment with the Company, or an Affiliate, is terminated following Change of Control and the Participant received a benefit under the Key Employee Change of Control Contract or the Change of Control Severance Pay Plan, the Participant (or, in the event of the Participant's death, the Participant's legal representative) may, within a period of not more than three (3) months after such cessation of employment, exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable at the date of such cessation. In no event may the Options be exercised more than seven (7) years from the date of grant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Participant is terminated by the Company, or an Affiliate, as provided in (iii) and (iv) above and the Participant qualifies for retirement under the Company's retirement plan, the Participant shall be deemed to have terminated because of retirement. The Committee may, under unusual circumstances and pursuant to the Plan, accelerate the time at which Options may be exercised. 3. The Options granted hereunder are not transferable by the Participant except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Options are exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Options, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon the Options or any right or privilege conferred hereby, the Options and the right and privilege conferred hereby shall immediately become null and void. 2
4. The Options may be adjusted or required to be surrendered pursuant to the provisions of the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. 5. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to the Options prior to the date of issuance to the Participant of a certificate or certificates for such Shares. 6. The Participant shall be considered to be in the employment of the Company, or an Affiliate, as long as the Participant remains an employee of either the Company, or an Affiliate, or a corporation or a parent or subsidiary of a corporation assuming or substituting a new option for this Option. Any question as to whether and when there has been a termination of such employment, and the cause of such termination, shall be determined either by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the employing corporation, and its determination shall be final. Nothing herein contained shall confer upon the Participant any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company, or an Affiliate, or interfere in any way with the right of the Company, or an Affiliate, to terminate the Participant's service, responsibilities, duties and authority to represent the Company or such Affiliate at any time, in its sole discretion and with or without cause subject to applicable law. 7. If at any time the Company shall determine in its discretion that the listing or qualification of Shares subject hereto under any securities exchange requirements or under any applicable state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of the Options or the issue of Shares hereunder, the Options may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company. 8. All distributions under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. At the election of the Participant, and subject to such rules as may be established by the Committee, such withholding obligations may be satisfied through the surrender of Shares which the Participant already owns, or to which the Participant is otherwise entitled to under the Plan. 9. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors, but neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder shall be assignable by the Participant except as specifically provided for herein. 10. Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, each term used herein which is defined in the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan shall have the meaning assigned such term in the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. 11. This Agreement may be amended by agreement of the Participant and the Company, without the consent of any other person. 12. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. 3

EXHIBIT 99.1 Anadarko Announces Record 2004 Results HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 28, 2005--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) President and CEO Jim Hackett said: "Anadarko performed exceptionally well in 2004 -- a period in which we have reshaped the entire company and changed the way we think and work in order to focus on improving returns for shareholders and positioning ourselves for sustainable, profitable growth. "We achieved record 2004 net income, with outstanding contributions from our Texas, Louisiana and other core onshore properties. In addition, we made discoveries and advanced development projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and made progress on our international growth strategy. I believe Anadarko is well prepared for the future." FOURTH-QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS Fourth-quarter net income available to common shareholders was $405 million, or $1.64 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.6 billion. Net income included an impairment in Qatar, certain legal settlements and charges related to the implementation of the refocused strategy, such as the repurchase of debt and the sale of non-core properties, offset partly by a change in Canadian tax rates. These items amounted to a net decrease of $96 million after taxes, or 39 cents per share (diluted). Net income included no gains or losses from the oil and gas asset sales, as proceeds were recognized as an adjustment of capitalized costs under full-cost accounting rules. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $294 million, or $1.17 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.28 billion. Fourth quarter 2003 net income included a net increase of $32 million after taxes, or 13 cents per share (diluted), related to a decrease in Canadian tax rates offset partly by impairments and restructuring costs. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $456 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $744 million for the fourth quarter of 2003. Cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $1.03 billion, which includes a reduction of $93 million for current income taxes related to the 2004 asset divestitures. The changes in assets and liabilities, as well as other items, were primarily a result of U.S. tax payments and Canadian deferred taxes in the fourth quarter, both of which were in connection with the asset divestitures. Fourth-quarter 2003 cash flow was $728 million.(1) Fourth-quarter sales volumes totaled 46 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared to 49 million BOE in 2003. Property divestitures prior to the end of the year reduced Anadarko's fourth-quarter 2004 production by about 5 million BOE. FULL YEAR 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS Anadarko reported full-year 2004 net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion, or $6.36 per share (diluted), on revenues of $6.07 billion. Net income included international property impairments, certain litigation and other settlements, and costs associated with the refocused strategy, offset partly by a change in Canadian tax rates. These items totaled a net decrease of $226 million after taxes, or 90 cents per share (diluted). Net income in 2003 was $1.29 billion, or $5.09 per share (diluted), on revenues of $5.12 billion, which included a net decrease of $26 million after taxes, or 10 cents per share (diluted), for impairments and restructuring costs, partly offset by a decrease in Canadian tax rates and a change in accounting principle. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $3.21 billion in 2004, up from $3.04 billion in 2003. Cash flow from 2004 operations before changes in assets and liabilities totaled $3.48 billion, which includes a reduction of $440 million for current income taxes related to the 2004 asset divestitures. This compares to $3.16 billion in 2003.(1) Sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids for 2004 totaled 190 million BOE, compared to 2003 volumes of 192 million BOE. Assuming the divested properties were owned by Anadarko for the entire year, the company believes 2004 volumes would have been approximately 196 million BOE. "This year, we made some tough decisions to implement a new strategy for Anadarko. We completed over $3 billion in pre-tax asset sales and refocused our efforts into areas where we have a competitive advantage: exploration and unconventional resource exploitation on a global basis," Hackett said. "The divested assets represent about 11 percent of 2003 year-end reserves and about 20 percent of 2004 annual production. The proceeds were used primarily to repurchase $1.3 billion, or 20.3 million shares, of outstanding common stock and to retire approximately $1.2 billion in debt. In addition, we ended the year with nearly $900 million of cash. Altogether, our greatly enhanced net debt to proved developed reserves and lower debt-to-capitalization ratios reflect our stronger and more flexible balance sheet." PROVED RESERVES & OIL AND GAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES Anadarko added 335 million BOE in proved reserves during 2004, ending the year with a total of 2.37 billion BOE. This is the 23rd consecutive year that Anadarko has more than replaced annual production with new proved reserves. Oil and gas capital expenditures totaled $2.99 billion in 2004. Anadarko sold properties accounting for 288 million BOE of 2003 year-end reserves, which contributed to a year-over-year reduction. Reserve additions in 2004 came primarily from fields in the North Louisiana Vernon, East Texas Bossier, West Texas Haley, Wyoming Salt Creek and Canadian Wild River areas, as well as the K2, K2 North, Spiderman and Jubilee deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko's proved reserves remain nearly balanced between natural gas (53 percent) and liquids (crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids) (47 percent). Proved reserves of oil and other liquids totaled 1.11 billion barrels at year-end 2004. Proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2004 totaled 7.5 trillion cubic feet.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures Below is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (GAAP) to net income available to common stockholders before the effect of implementation costs of the company's refocused strategy, certain litigation and other settlements, oil and gas impairments, restructuring costs, Canadian tax rate change and change in accounting principle, net of taxes, (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company uses net income excluding the effect of these items to evaluate the company's results for comparability between periods.

The company uses cash flow from operations before changes in assets and liabilities to demonstrate the company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities.
