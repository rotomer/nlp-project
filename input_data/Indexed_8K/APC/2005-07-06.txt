Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 29, 2005, two wholly owned subsidiaries of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ("Anadarko"), Anadarko LNG Marketing LLC and Anadarko Canada LNG Marketing Company (collectively, "Anadarko LNG Marketing"), entered into agreements with two subsidiaries of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. and Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Limited Partnership (collectively, "Maritimes & Northeast"). Anadarko LNG Marketing has entered into the agreements in order to deliver natural gas from a liquefied natural gas ("LNG") facility Anadarko plans to build in Nova Scotia, called Bear Head, to prospective markets in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Maritimes & Northeast has agreed to expand the capacity of its pipeline so it can accommodate the projected natural gas volumes from Bear Head. These agreements govern how the parties will:
The parties have executed the following suite of agreements:
In addition, Anadarko will provide four Guaranties for the obligations of Anadarko LNG Marketing under each Precedent Agreement and each Service Agreement. The following is a summary of the material terms of the agreements, copies of which are attached to this document and are incorporated herein by reference. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreements. You should carefully read the agreements in their entirety.
Precedent Agreements
To accommodate the expected volumes of natural gas from the Bear Head terminal, Maritimes & Northeast must expand its existing pipeline facilities in Canada and the United States. The Precedent Agreements signed by the parties establish the conditions on which Maritimes & Northeast will proceed with design, regulatory approvals and construction of the expansion facilities and, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, Anadarko LNG Marketing will take "firm transportation" service on the pipeline, which means that Anadarko LNG Marketing will be obligated to pay for transportation of a specified volume of natural gas without interruption and Maritimes & Northeast will be obligated to transport such specified volume of gas.
Maritimes & Northeast initiated the regulatory process with an "open season" for new transportation capacity that would result from an expansion. During the open season, which commenced February 15 and ended March 31, shippers in Canada and the United States submitted nominations to acquire firm transportation services. Following the open season and certain so-called reverse open season and preferential rights procedures, Maritimes & Northeast will provide a refined description of the planned expansion to Anadarko LNG Marketing. If the parameters of the planned expansion are materially different from the initial description/plan, Anadarko LNG Marketing may at that time elect to terminate the Precedent Agreements, subject to reimbursement for Maritimes & Northeast's costs incurred to that point.
Anadarko LNG Marketing's potential reimbursement obligation under the Precedent Agreements increases over time as Maritimes & Northeast incurs pre-service costs, up to a maximum of US$215 million at the start of construction. The maximum cap is, however, subject to adjustment (increase or decrease) in the event that capacity turn back levels differ materially from the levels projected by
 
Maritimes & Northeast. Anadarko will be required to guarantee the reimbursement obligations of its affiliates under the Precedent Agreements.
The Precedent Agreements contain a number of conditions precedent and additional rights of termination, described generally below. The Precedent Agreements also provide that if a party determines in good faith in advance that it will not be able to satisfy one or more of the conditions precedent, that party may terminate the Precedent Agreements. If Anadarko LNG Marketing exercises this early termination option, or if the Precedent Agreements otherwise terminate as a result of Anadarko LNG Marketing's failure to satisfy a condition precedent or to take steps necessary for Maritimes & Northeast to satisfy a condition precedent, Anadarko LNG Marketing is subject to a range of reimbursement obligations in the maximum amounts on or before the dates as set forth below (as such caps may be adjusted as described above):
Certain conditions precedent in favor of Anadarko LNG Marketing are tied to specific dates, ranging from August 2005 to May 2007, including the following:
Likewise, certain conditions precedent in favor of Maritimes & Northeast are tied to dates, ranging from June 2005 to June 2007, including the following:
The Precedent Agreements contain additional conditions precedent not tied to specific dates that must be satisfied or waived in order for service to commence, including completion of the expansion facilities and execution of the related agreements.
Once Maritimes & Northeast begins construction of the expansion facilities, Anadarko LNG Marketing will have the right to terminate the Precedent Agreements only if Maritimes & Northeast fails to complete construction and deliver full service to Anadarko LNG Marketing by the later of (i) the target date the parties establish for full service, (ii) November 1, 2009 or (iii) the end of two full construction cycles, and Anadarko LNG Marketing may exercise this termination option only if the Bear Head terminal has been completed and is ready for service. If Anadarko LNG Marketing does not exercise the termination option at that time, then the option will renew with the date November 1, 2011 substituted for November 1, 2009.
Maritimes & Northeast has the right to terminate this transaction if Anadarko fails to make a reasonable showing that LNG supply arrangements are adequate to support operation of the Bear Head terminal on or after the date Maritimes & Northeast delivers to Anadarko LNG Marketing the Project Description, which may be as early as mid-October 2005.
 
In the event either party terminates the Precedent Agreements pursuant to one of the above described conditions precedent or additional rights of termination, the parties will no longer have obligation under the Firm Transportation Service Agreements.
Firm Transportation Service Agreements
As a condition of entering into the Precedent Agreements, Anadarko LNG Marketing also is required to execute firm service agreements for transportation on the Canadian and United States portions of the pipeline. The primary term of the transportation agreements is 20 years. The parties agreed to negotiated rates for service on the United States portion of the pipeline, for an initial period of five years from commencement of full service, with caps on escalation for years six (105% of the base) and seven (110% of the base) if the parties do not agree on a new negotiated rate before then. The Negotiated Rate Agreement must be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission before it becomes effective.
For service on the Canadian portion of the pipeline, Maritimes & Northeast must file a proposed toll with the NEB. The toll that applies to Anadarko LNG Marketing's service on the Canadian portion will be determined by the NEB on the basis of that filing.
Based on current assumptions regarding the scope of the proposed expansion, current projections regarding the cost of the expansion and the participation of other shippers in the expansion, including but not limited to the potential for other shippers to relinquish capacity as part of anticipated so-called reverse open seasons in the United States and Canada (and noting specifically that these assumptions are likely to change materially between now and the date on which Maritimes & Northeast finalizes its proposed facility design for the expansion), Anadarko LNG Marketing currently projects that annual demand charges due under the firm transportation service agreements may be in the range of US$123  $182 million per year for the first five years of the contract, potentially escalating by up to 5% in year 6 and 10% in year 7, exclusive of fuel and surcharges. At least as of the eighth year of the firm transportation service agreements, rates under both the United States and Canadian Precedent Agreements will be redetermined, based on then current conditions, either through a superseding negotiated rate agreement or through litigation or settlement of future rate proceedings before the NEB or FERC.
Anadarko will be required to guarantee the payment by Anadarko LNG Marketing of all rates and charges due under the firm transportation service agreements for their full 20-year initial term.
In-Service Dates
Under the Precedent Agreements, the parties are to work together to establish a partial service commencement date, in the event Maritimes & Northeast completes the expansion in phases, and a full service commencement date through a "windows process". With respect to partial service, the parties will begin with a window from November 1, 2007 to November 1, 2008, then successively narrow the window through an iterative process until they ultimately establish a single target date. The procedure is the same for the start of full service, with an initial window period of June 1, 2008 to November 1, 2009, which the parties are to narrow successively and ultimately establish a target date. Securing partial service under the agreement in advance of full service is at Anadarko LNG Marketing's sole election.
The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the Company's operations, economic performance and financial condition.

If, notwithstanding Pipeline's due diligence, Pipeline is unable to commence the firm transportation service for Customer as contemplated in Paragraph 5 of this Precedent Agreement, Pipeline will continue to proceed with due diligence to complete arrangements for such firm transportation service, and commence the firm transportation service contemplated thereunder for Customer at the earliest practicable
7. 
Construction of Project
 
date thereafter. Pipeline will neither be liable nor will this Precedent Agreement, the Service Agreement or the Negotiated Rate Agreement be subject to cancellation (except with respect to termination as provided in Paragraph 10 hereof) if Pipeline is unable to complete the construction of such authorized Project facilities and commence the firm transportation service contemplated herein as contemplated in Paragraph 5 of this Precedent Agreement; provided that, nothing in this sentence is intended to limit Customer's rights under Paragraph 10 of this Precedent Agreement.
     . Commencement of service under the Service Agreement and Pipeline's and Customer's rights and obligations under the Service Agreement and the Negotiated Rate Agreement are expressly made subject to satisfaction or, as applicable, waiver in writing of the following conditions precedent:
8. 
Conditions Precedent
     (A) Conditions precedent for the benefit of Pipeline (only Pipeline shall, except as set forth below, have the right to waive, in writing, the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(A), and neither Party shall have the right to waive the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(A)(x) and 8(B)(vi)):
 
 
 
     (B) Conditions precedent for the benefit of Customer (only Customer shall, except as set forth below, have the right to waive, in writing, the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(B), and neither Party shall have the right to waive the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(A)(x) and 8(B)(vi)):
 
 
     Unless otherwise provided for herein, the Commission authorization(s) and approval(s) contemplated in Paragraph 1 of this Precedent Agreement must be issued in form and substance satisfactory to both Parties. For the purposes of this Precedent Agreement, such Commission authorization(s) and approval(s) shall be deemed satisfactory if issued or granted in form and substance as requested, or if issued in a manner acceptable to Pipeline and such authorization(s) and approval(s), as issued, will not have a material adverse effect on Customer. Customer shall notify Pipeline in writing not later than fifteen (15) days after the issuance of the Commission certificate(s), authorization(s) and approval(s), including any order issued as a preliminary determination on non-environmental issues, if such certificate(s), authorization(s) and approval(s) are not satisfactory to it. All other governmental authorizations, approvals, permits and/or exemptions required of Pipeline must be
 
issued in form and substance acceptable to Pipeline. All other governmental authorizations, approvals, permits and/or exemptions required of Customer, shall be issued in form and substance acceptable to Customer. All governmental approvals required by this Precedent Agreement must be duly granted by the Commission or other governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction, and must be final and no longer subject to rehearing or appeal; provided, however, that Pipeline or Customer may waive in writing with respect to the governmental authorizations required of it, the requirement that such authorization(s) and approval(s) be final and no longer subject to rehearing or appeal. Customer and Pipeline each agree to provide written notice to the other promptly after the dates specified in Paragraphs 8(A) and 8(B) above in the event that a condition precedent for the benefit of such Party has not been satisfied.
     
9. 
Reimbursement
     (A) If this Precedent Agreement is terminated under Paragraph 10(C), 10(E) or 10 (F) of this Precedent Agreement or because of the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraphs 8(A)(vii), 8(A)(ix), 8(B)(i), 8(B)(ii), 8(B)(iii), or 8(B)(v) (or Paragraphs 8(A)(i), 8(A)(v) or 8(A)(vi), to the extent that the failure to satisfy one or more of these three conditions precedent is due solely to Customer's failure to provide sufficient evidence regarding the quantity of Customer's LNG supply, provided, however, that Pipeline shall first have requested in writing specific information regarding such quantity of LNG and Customer shall have had thirty (30) days in which to provide such information requested by Pipeline), then Customer shall, at the option and election of Pipeline (such option to be exercised, if at all, in writing within sixty (60) days of such termination), reimburse Pipeline as hereinafter
 
provided for all of Pipeline's reasonable and verifiable costs incurred, allocated and paid as of the date of such termination, or for which Pipeline is contractually obligated to pay (and does pay), as of the date of such termination, solely in conjunction with its efforts to satisfy its obligations under this Precedent Agreement ("Pre-service Costs"), except to the extent such expenses previously have been reimbursed or are reimbursable by Anadarko or by any third party or parties. Pre-service Costs will include those third-party expenditures and/or costs incurred, allocated and paid by Pipeline or for which Pipeline is contractually obligated to pay and does pay, and Pipeline's internal direct and corporate overhead costs allocated to technical services associated with the Project, which shall include engineering, construction, materials and equipment, environmental, land acquisition and any other technically-based costs related to the firm service contemplated in this Precedent Agreement and incurred in furtherance of Pipeline's efforts to satisfy its obligations under this Precedent Agreement. For clarity, the Parties specifically agree that Pre-service Costs will not include internal management and internal legal costs. In addition, identifiable physical assets for which Pipeline is reimbursed pursuant to this Paragraph 9 and not already installed as part of Pipeline's FERC or National Energy Board of Canada jurisdictional facilities by Pipeline shall become the sole property of Customer, if and to the extent Customer so elects and provides written notice of such election to Pipeline.
     (B) Customer's obligations under this Paragraph 9 are subject to Pipeline's fulfillment of Pipeline's periodic reporting requirements and compliance with the milestone-based cost limits with respect to the Project facilities to be applied in connection with this Paragraph 9 as set forth in Schedule B.
 
     (C) If Pipeline exercises its option to seek reimbursement pursuant to Paragraph 9(A) of this Precedent Agreement, then Pipeline shall, within sixty (60) days of exercising such option in writing, submit to Customer an invoice reflecting the Pre-service Costs for which it seeks reimbursement. Such invoice shall be accompanied by such detailed and supporting documentation as Customer may reasonably request in writing. Customer shall, no later than sixty (60) days following receipt of (i) such invoice and (ii) such detailed and supporting documentation as it may reasonably request in writing (the "Due Date"), pay by electronic funds transfer to an account designated by Pipeline in writing the amount so invoiced by Pipeline; provided that Customer may withhold from such payment the portion, if any, of such invoiced amount that Customer in good faith disputes. In the event that Customer in good faith disputes any portion of such invoiced amount, Customer shall submit to Pipeline on or before the Due Date, in writing and in reasonable detail, an explanation of the reason(s) for such dispute. Customer and Pipeline shall in good faith attempt to promptly resolve any such disputed invoice amount. Any disputed invoice amounts subsequently determined by the Parties or by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 24 to have been properly invoiced by Pipeline shall be paid by Customer within sixty (60) days following such determination, plus interest on late payments and disputed amounts found to be proper with interest determined at the U.S. prime interest rate as published in the from time to time, plus 200 basis points, from the date Customer should have paid Pipeline until the date Customer actually pays Pipeline.
Wall Street Journal
     (D) If, within five (5) years from the time Customer pays the Pre-service Costs with respect to the Project facilities, any other expansion project on Pipeline's system

Disputes regarding this Paragraph 9 shall be resolved between the Parties pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 24 below.

Termination
     (A) If any of the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 8 of this Precedent Agreement, excluding the condition precedent set forth in Paragraphs 8 (A)(x), 8(B)(iv) and 8(B)(vi), have not been fully satisfied, or waived in writing by Pipeline or Customer, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 8, by the earlier of the applicable dates specified therein (if any) or November 1, 2009, then either Pipeline or Customer may for any such failure to satisfy or to waive thereafter terminate this Precedent Agreement, the Service Agreement and the Negotiated Rate Agreement by giving sixty (60) days prior written notice of its intention to terminate to the non-terminating Party; provided, however, if the conditions precedent are satisfied, or waived in writing by Pipeline or Customer, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 8 of this Precedent Agreement, within such sixty (60) day notice period, then such termination will not be effective. In the event notice of termination is provided by either Party, and this Precedent Agreement subsequently is terminated as a result of such notice, Customer's financial obligations with respect to Paragraph 9 of this Precedent Agreement, if any, shall cease to increase as of the date of such notice of termination, with the exception of reasonable and incidental post-termination notice expenses (such as demobilization and contract termination expenses) shown to Customer's reasonable satisfaction, by Pipeline in writing to have been required of Pipeline.
     (B) On the latest to occur of (i) the Target Date for Full Service, (ii) November 1, 2009, or (iii) the last day of the second, consecutive full Construction Cycle following the Construction Authorization Date, if Pipeline has not completed construction of the
 
Project facilities and made such facilities available for full service, Customer shall have the right, to be exercised if at all no later than thirty (30) days following the last to occur of the foregoing dates, to terminate this Precedent Agreement by giving sixty (60) days prior written notice of its intention to terminate to Pipeline; provided, however, if Pipeline makes such Project facilities available for full service during such sixty (60) day notice period, then such termination will not be effective. If Customer does not exercise the right it has to terminate this Precedent Agreement under the preceding sentence of this Paragraph 10(B), then the November 1, 2009 date referred to therein and in Paragraph 10(A) shall become November 1, 2011. For purposes of this Paragraph 10(B), "Construction Cycle" shall mean, with respect to any calendar year, the period from June 1 through December 31 of such calendar year, and "Construction Authorization Date" shall mean the date on which Pipeline has received (i) all of the governmental authorizations set forth in Paragraphs 8(A)(i) and 8(A)(xiii) of this Precedent Agreement and (ii) Pipeline's management committee authorizations necessary to initiate construction of the Project facilities. Pipeline promptly shall provide written notice of such Construction Authorization Date to Customer. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Paragraph 10(B), Customer shall not have a right to terminate this Precedent Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph 10(B) unless and until Customer's Facilities are completed and available for service.
     (C) With respect to Paragraph 6(B) of this Precedent Agreement, to the extent the good faith estimate of the negotiated rate or the scope of the Project contemplated in the Project Description materially differs from that which forms the basis for this Precedent Agreement, Customer shall have the option but not the obligation to
 
terminate this Precedent Agreement, in Customer's sole discretion, after providing written notice to Pipeline of such election within forty-five (45) days following receipt of such good faith estimate and the Project Description.
     (D) Pipeline shall have the option but not the obligation to terminate this Precedent Agreement in good faith for inability or anticipated inability to meet any one or more of the following conditions precedent, prior to the dates set forth above for satisfaction of such conditions precedent in Paragraph 8(A) of this Precedent Agreement: 8(A)(v) and 8(A)(vi); provided that, Pipeline shall have the option at any time to terminate this Precedent Agreement prior to the date on which the condition precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(A)(ii) is satisfied or waived by Pipeline in writing. Such options shall be exercised by providing notice of termination to Customer in writing.
     (E) Customer shall have the option but not the obligation to terminate this Precedent Agreement in good faith for inability or anticipated inability to meet any one or more of the following conditions precedent, prior to the dates set forth above for satisfaction of such conditions precedent in Paragraph 8(B) of this Precedent Agreement: 8(B)(iii), 8(B)(v), and 8(B)(vii); provided that, Customer shall have the option at any time to terminate this Precedent Agreement prior to the date on which the condition precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(B)(ii) is satisfied or waived by Customer in writing. Such options shall be exercised by providing notice of termination to Pipeline in writing.
 
     (F) The Parties acknowledge that the availability of LNG supplies to support Customer's Terminal is a necessity for Customer to successfully operate Customer's Terminal, and, accordingly, Customer's access to LNG supplies is a necessity for Pipeline to agree to expand its pipeline system. Therefore, in addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Precedent Agreement, Customer agrees that Pipeline shall have the right to terminate this Precedent Agreement on or after the date on which Pipeline provides Customer with the Project Description, if Customer fails to demonstrate to Pipeline, to Pipeline's satisfaction acting reasonably, that Customer has arranged for an adequate quantity of LNG supplies to support the operation of Customer's Terminal when considering the period covered by the Primary Term of the Service Agreement (such demonstration may include production of LNG supply contracts or other types of written commitments of supply redacted to exclude confidential pricing provisions but which would include the identity of the counterparty to such supply contract(s) (or country in which such supplies are produced) and provisions related to the character of service (i.e., whether such supply is firm or interruptible and the terms related to any potential supply interruption), and the term of the supply agreement(s)). If Pipeline exercises this right to terminate this Precedent Agreement, Pipeline shall provide written notice to Customer on or after the date on which Pipeline provides Customer with the Project Description, stating that Pipeline has elected to terminate this Precedent Agreement under this Paragraph 10, and this Precedent Agreement shall terminate upon delivery of such written notice to Customer. Such termination option shall be exercised, if at all, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Pipeline provides Customer with the Project Description.
 
     (G) Except as provided in Paragraph 25 hereof, if this Precedent Agreement is not terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 10(A), 10(B), 10(C), 10(D), 10(E) or 10(F) of this Precedent Agreement, then this Precedent Agreement will terminate by its express terms on the Service Commencement Date under the Service Agreement, as provided for in Paragraph 5 of this Precedent Agreement, and thereafter Pipeline's and Customer's rights and obligations related to the transportation transaction contemplated herein shall be determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of such Service Agreement, the Negotiated Rate Agreement and the Tariff, as effective from time to time.
     . Customer will endeavor to satisfy by February 1, 2006, one of the following creditworthiness requirements set forth in Paragraph 11(A) and agrees that, upon written request by Pipeline, Customer shall promptly provide evidence to Pipeline of same:
11. 
Creditworthiness
     (A) Customer (or any entity that guarantees all of Customer's obligations under the Service Agreement for the initial twenty (20) year term of the Service Agreement) shall have an investment grade rating for its long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. of Baa3 or higher or from Standard & Poor's of BBB- or higher. In the event that Customer or its guarantor meets the requirement contained in the immediately preceding sentence initially, but is later downgraded below such investment grade rating, Customer will be required to obtain a guarantee from any affiliate of Customer that is an investment grade rated entity as defined in Paragraph 11(A); provided, that if Customer does not have any affiliates with such investment
 
grade rating, Customer shall be required to satisfy the requirement set forth in Paragraph 11(B).
     (B) At any time and from time to time that neither Customer nor its guarantor meets the requirements set forth in the first sentence of Paragraph 11(A), Customer will be accepted as creditworthy by Pipeline if Pipeline reasonably determines that, notwithstanding the absence of such investment grade credit rating, the financial position of Customer (or an entity that guarantees all of Customer's obligations under the Service Agreement for the initial twenty (20) year term of the Service Agreement) is reasonably acceptable to Pipeline and acceptable to Pipeline's Existing Lenders and the Project Lenders.
     (C) The Parties agree that, if and when Pipeline requests evidence in writing of Customer's or its guarantor's ability to satisfy the creditworthiness requirements set forth in Paragraphs 11(A), 11(B) and/or 11(E), and Customer or its guarantor fails, in Pipeline's reasonable discretion, to provide such evidence, Pipeline may suspend its obligations under this Precedent Agreement until Customer or its guarantor has provided such evidence; provided, further that Pipeline shall first provide Customer with written notice of its intent to suspend performance hereunder (which notice will state whether Pipeline is suspending its obligations due to Customers' noncompliance with Paragraph 11(A), 11(B) and/or 11(E)) and Pipeline shall provide Customer, prior to suspension, with at least 30 days in which to cure the claimed failure to provide such evidence.
     (D) If and to the extent that an entity guarantees Customer's obligations for the initial twenty (20) year term of the Service Agreement and/or for Customer's
 
obligations under this Precedent Agreement, such guarantees shall be in the form, content, and substance as expressly set forth as Schedule C hereto (for the Service Agreement) and Schedule D hereto (for the Precedent Agreement), respectively. Each such guaranty shall be assignable in accordance with its stated terms.
     (E) With respect to Customer's obligations under this Precedent Agreement, Customer, or its guarantor, shall meet the credit rating requirements of Paragraph 11(A). If Customer or its guarantor loses such investment grade rating and, if Customer's guarantor is not an affiliate of Customer, then Customer shall endeavor to first provide a guaranty from an affiliate of Customer with an investment grade rating as defined in Paragraph 11(A), and if Customer's guarantor is an affiliate of Customer, then Customer shall endeavor to first provide a guarantee from another affiliate of Customer with an investment grade rating as defined in Paragraph 11(A). If no affiliate of Customer has such investment grade rating, Customer or its guarantor shall provide a standby irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution reasonably acceptable to Pipeline and acceptable to Pipeline's Existing Lenders and Project Lenders ("Letter of Credit") in an amount equal to the applicable estimated Pre-service Costs set forth in Schedule B as of the date on which such assurances are requested, plus the estimated additional costs projected to be incurred for the following twelve months as set forth in Schedule B. The right of Pipeline to suspend its obligations under this Precedent Agreement under Paragraph 11(C) shall not be affected by Customer providing a letter of credit under this Paragraph 11(E); provided, however, if Pipeline provides notice of its intention to suspend performance pursuant to Paragraph 11(C), the Parties agree that Customer may replace any outstanding letters of credit previously posted by Customer
 
pursuant to this Paragraph 11(E) with a replacement Letter of Credit in the amount of the applicable estimated Pre-Service Costs for the next Milestone Event set forth in Schedule B scheduled to occur following the date on which Pipeline provides such notice of suspension; provided further that, in the event Pipeline subsequently resumes performance under this Precedent Agreement after providing notice of suspension (and provides written notice to Customer of Pipeline's resumption of performance), but prior to any termination of this Precedent Agreement, then Customer shall tender an additional Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit posted by Customer during suspension, and (ii) an amount equal to the applicable estimated Pre-service Costs set forth in Schedule B as of the date on which Pipeline suspended performance under this Agreement, plus the estimated additional costs projected to be incurred for the following twelve months as set forth in Schedule B.

Customer's Representations and Warranties
     . This Precedent Agreement may not be modified or amended unless the Parties execute written agreements to that effect.
14. 
Modification or Amendment
     . Any party which succeeds by purchase, merger, or consolidation of title to the properties of Pipeline or Customer necessary to provide or receive service pursuant to this Precedent Agreement or (separately) the Service Agreement and the Negotiated Rate Agreement, will, if its predecessor in title is a Party, be entitled to the rights and will be subject to the
15. 
Succession, Merger, Consolidation of Properties
 
obligations of its predecessor in title under this Precedent Agreement, the Service Agreement and the Negotiated Rate Agreement provided that such party, (either the successor to Pipeline or the successor to Customer or any entity guaranteeing the credit of such party), shall be considered creditworthy by the other Party. For purposes of this Paragraph 15, the test of creditworthiness shall be satisfied if such successor or its guarantor satisfies the investment grade rating threshold set forth in the first sentence of Paragraph 11(A). Except as provided in the foregoing sentence and in Paragraphs 16(A) and 16(C) below, neither Customer nor Pipeline may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Precedent Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
     
16. 
Assignment
     (A) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party shall have the right, without the prior written consent of the other Party, to assign, mortgage, or pledge all or any of its rights, interests, and benefits under this Precedent Agreement and/or the Service Agreement and/or the Negotiated Rate Agreement to secure payment of any indebtedness incurred or to be incurred in connection with the development and construction of the Project facilities, or Customer's Terminal and/or Customer's Facilities, as applicable. Each Party agrees to provide the other Party's lenders such reasonable assurances and undertakings as they may require in connection with such assignment, so long as the terms thereof are reasonable and not contrary to market standards for such assurances and undertakings and do not decrease such non-assigning Party's rights or increase its obligations under this Precedent Agreement, the Service Agreement, or the Negotiated Rate Agreement in any material manner. In
 
addition, each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party to obtain such other Party's financing by supplying such other Party's lenders information concerning the first Party (that is in the first Party's possession and is not of a proprietary or confidential nature) reasonably requested in writing by the other Party's lenders.
     (B) Customer may assign either all of its rights and obligations in or an undivided interest to its rights and obligations under this Precedent Agreement and all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Service Agreement and/or the Negotiated Rate Agreement to a subsidiary, affiliate, co-venturer, joint venture entity or other third party; provided that, each such assignee of rights and obligations under this Precedent Agreement, the Service Agreement and/or the Negotiated Rate Agreement executes a new firm service agreement under Rate Schedule MN365 and a new negotiated rate agreement covering the rights and obligations which have been assigned to it. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph 16(B), no assignment of all of Customer's rights under either this Precedent Agreement or the Service Agreement or the Negotiated Rate Agreement (other than assignments made pursuant to Paragraph 16(C) below) under this Paragraph 16(B) will release Customer of any of its obligations under this Precedent Agreement, until Customer receives the prior written consent of Pipeline, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or unduly delayed; provided, that Pipeline agrees that it will promptly provide such consent if (i) such assignee or its guarantor has an investment grade credit rating as defined in Paragraph 11(A) hereof and (ii) such assignee possesses, in Pipeline's reasonable discretion, the requisite technical expertise or the demonstrated ability to acquire the requisite technical expertise to complete Customer's Terminal and Customer's Facilities
 
in a timely manner to meet the Service Commencement Date under the Service Agreement.
ANY SUCH ASSIGNMENT HEREUNDER TO WHICH PIPELINE HAS CONSENTED SHALL FULLY, COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY DISCHARGE, RELEASE AND TERMINATE CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH ASSIGNMENT FORWARD, AND IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ENTITY GUARANTEES CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TERMS OF PARAGRAPH 11(D), SUCH GUARANTEE, THE FORM OF WHICH IS SET FORTH IN SCHEDULE C HERETO, SHALL AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT ANY ACTION OF CUSTOMER OR THE GUARANTOR UNDER SUCH GUARANTEE TERMINATE OR BE REDUCED IN ALL RESPECTS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PURPOSES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FOREGOING ASSIGNMENT.
     (C) Customer may assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Service Agreement to any party; provided that, each such assignee executes a new firm service agreement under Rate Schedule MN365 and a new negotiated rate agreement substantially identical in all respects (other than the quantity of natural gas to be transported in the event of assignments to more than one party of partial undivided interests) with the Service Agreement and the Negotiated Rate Agreement covering the rights and obligations which have been assigned to it.
ANY SUCH ASSIGNMENT HEREUNDER SHALL, WITH RESPECT TO THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CUSTOMER SO ASSIGNED, FULLY, COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY DISCHARGE, RELEASE AND TERMINATE CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SERVICE AGREEMENT AND THE NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENT FROM
 
,
THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH ASSIGNMENT FORWARD
AND IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ENTITY GUARANTEES CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TERMS OF PARAGRAPH 11(D), SUCH GUARANTEE, THE FORM OF WHICH IS SET FORTH IN SCHEDULE C HERETO, SHALL AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT ANY ACTION OF CUSTOMER OR THE GUARANTOR UNDER SUCH GUARANTEE TERMINATE OR BE REDUCED IN ALL RESPECTS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PURPOSES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FOREGOING ASSIGNMENT.
     (D) Notwithstanding any other provision of Paragraphs 16(B) or 16(C) of this Precedent Agreement, Customer may not assign any rights or obligations as contemplated under Paragraph 16(B) or 16(C) to any entity, unless (i) the assignee (or assignee's guarantor) has an investment grade credit rating as defined in the first sentence of Paragraph 11(A) of this Precedent Agreement, and (ii) the assignment is implemented prior to the earlier of the Initial Commencement Date or the Service Commencement Date. After the Initial Commencement Date, any assignment of firm capacity must be effectuated pursuant to the provisions of the Tariff. In addition, any assignment of Customer's rights and obligations under the Service Agreement and Negotiated Rate Agreement under Paragraph 16(B) or 16(C) prior to the Initial Commencement Date shall be an assignment of rights and obligations that are substantially identical to those under the Service Agreement and Negotiated Rate Agreement, except with respect to the MDTQ and Points of Delivery (in connection with assignments of partial undivided interests); provided, that in the aggregate, the service rights remaining under the Service Agreement and the service rights under all service
 
agreements between Pipeline and any of Customer's assignees resulting from such assignments shall not exceed the service rights under the Service Agreement and the Points of Delivery in any new service agreement shall either be Customer's Points of Delivery or points of delivery within Customer's Contract Path (as defined in the Tariff).
     . Except as expressly provided for in this Precedent Agreement, nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person or entity not a Party any rights, remedies or obligations under or by reason of this Precedent Agreement.

NEITHER PARTY, NOR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF, SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE RESULTING FROM ANY BREACH OF OR DEFAULT UNDER THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION HOWSOEVER CAUSED OR OCCASIONED, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION.
     . Except as herein otherwise provided, any notice, advisement, request, demand, statement, or invoice provided for in this Precedent Agreement, or any notice which either Party desires to give to the other, must be in writing and will be deemed duly delivered (a) upon personal delivery to the Party to be notified, (b) on confirmation of receipt by facsimile by the Party to be notified, (c) one (1) working day after deposit with a reputable overnight courier, prepaid for overnight delivery and addressed to the Party to be notified, or (d) three (3) days after deposit with the U.S. Postal Service, postage prepaid, registered or certified, with return receipt requested and addressed to the Party to be notified, at the address indicated for such Party below:

This Precedent Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall, if both Parties execute a counterpart, be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The facsimile transmission of any signed original of this Precedent Agreement, and transmission or retransmission of any signed facsimile transmission, shall be the same as delivery of an original. At the request of either Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile transmitted signatures by signing an original document for delivery between them.

Multiple Counterparts
     
24. 
Dispute Resolution
     (A) Any controversy, cause of action, dispute or claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with, this Precedent Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof (collectively a "Dispute"), shall be settled solely, exclusively and finally
 
through mandatory and binding arbitration, to which the Parties hereby agree to submit, it being the intention of the Parties that this is a broad form arbitration agreement designed to encompass all possible Disputes between the Parties relating to this Precedent Agreement.
     (B) A Party shall not be permitted to submit a Dispute to arbitration under this Precedent Agreement unless such Party provides the other Party prior notice of its intention to submit such Dispute to arbitration hereunder. Such notice shall, in reasonable detail, identify the grounds for such Dispute. Following the receipt of such notice, executive officers of the Parties, or their designees, shall immediately, for a period of ten (10) consecutive working days, use reasonable commercial efforts to resolve and settle such Dispute. If the executive officers of the Parties, or their designees, are able to resolve such Dispute during such period, the Parties shall prepare and sign a written memorandum setting forth the terms of such resolution, which shall be binding upon the Parties. Failing such resolution and settlement within such period, either Party shall have the right to submit such Dispute to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Precedent Agreement. With respect to any Dispute, all applicable statutory limitations periods and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled for the duration of the negotiations provided for above and for the duration of the arbitration proceedings set forth in this Paragraph 24.
     (C) All arbitration procedures under this Precedent Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as amended and in effect from time to time. All arbitration procedures shall be administered by the AAA. The tribunal for the
 
arbitration shall consist of three arbitrators, one to be designated by each Party and the third to be selected by the mutual written agreement of the two arbitrators. In the event either Party fails to appoint an arbitrator, or if the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties fail to reach agreement on a third arbitrator, the AAA shall select such arbitrator(s). Each Party shall designate its arbitrator within twenty (20) days of receiving a notice of arbitration. Prior to acceptance of appointment as an arbitrator, each arbitrator shall have read and affirmatively agreed to observe all provisions of the AAA's Code of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes. THE EXPEDITED PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE RULES SHALL APPLY AND THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS OR CHOICE OF LAWS RULES OR PRINCIPLES AS APPLIED IN TEXAS) SHALL APPLY. This Precedent Agreement involves interstate commerce in several ways, including, without limitation, the fact that the Project involves the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act. The choice of Texas law shall not be interpreted as a choice to exclude applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act to the enforceability and scope of this arbitration provision. It is therefore specifically understood that both Texas and federal law, neither to the exclusion of the other, shall apply to the enforceability and scope of this provision, and, in the event of a conflict between Texas and federal law, the law maximizing the enforceability and scope of this provision, including laws relating to appellate remedies, may be invoked, without excluding applicability of other law, by the Party seeking to compel arbitration. If, for purposes of determining Texas or federal law, a conflict or difference of opinion exists between lower state courts and lower
 
federal courts, as the case may be, this arbitration provision shall be interpreted to select the precedent of that lower state court or that lower federal court that maximizes the enforceability and scope of this arbitration provision. All arbitrations hereunder shall take place in Houston, Texas. The Parties specifically agree that the judgment or award of the tribunal shall be final and binding on each Party and for all purposes. Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of this Precedent Agreement. Should the Parties ever be prevented by applicable law from utilizing arbitration to resolve Disputes hereunder, then the choice of law provisions of Paragraph 20 shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the Parties shall submit such Disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate court located in Harris County, Texas (to whose exclusive jurisdiction the Parties hereby agree to submit). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Paragraph 24 shall be construed in any manner to exclude, qualify, limit or condition the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of the FERC (as well as the United States Courts of Appeal that may review decisions of FERC) over matters, disputes or controversies within the scope of FERC's exclusive or primary jurisdiction, or limit, qualify or condition the right of either Party to present, prosecute or defend its interests before FERC or reviewing courts.
     . Notwithstanding any termination of this Precedent Agreement, the provisions of Paragraphs 7, 9, 11(D), 12, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of this Precedent Agreement shall survive such termination pursuant to their respective terms.

     (A) Contemporaneously with the execution of this Precedent Agreement and the Service Agreement, Maritimes-Canada and an affiliate of Customer are entering into the Maritimes-Canada Precedent Agreement and a firm transportation service agreement for service on the Maritimes-Canada system (the "Maritimes-Canada Service Agreement"). The Parties will also enter into the Negotiated Rate Agreement which will govern the rate for service under the Service Agreement.
     (B) Upon termination of any of the agreements described in Paragraph 26(A), except with respect to a termination of this Precedent Agreement or the Maritimes-Canada Precedent Agreement upon commencement of service under the Service Agreement or the Maritimes-Canada Service Agreement, respectively, and except with respect to a termination of the Negotiated Rate Agreement in accordance with its terms, each of the agreements described in Paragraph 26(A) to which Pipeline and Customer are Parties shall promptly terminate, except as provided herein, and have no further force or effect.

Reimbursement
     (A) If this Precedent Agreement is terminated under Paragraph 10(C), 10(E) or 10(F) of this Precedent Agreement or because of the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraphs 8(A)(vii), 8(A)(ix), 8(B)(i), 8(B)(ii), 8(B)(iii), 8(B)(v), or 8(B)(vii) (or Paragraphs 8(A)(i), 8(A)(v) or 8(A)(vi), to the extent that the failure to satisfy one or more of these three conditions precedent is due solely to Customer's failure to provide sufficient evidence regarding the quantity of Customer's LNG supply); provided, however, that Pipeline shall first have requested in writing specific information regarding such quantity of LNG and Customer shall have had thirty (30) days, or such shorter period as may be required by the Board, in which to provide
 
such information requested by Pipeline), then Customer shall, at the option and election of Pipeline (such option to be exercised, if at all, in writing within sixty (60) days of such termination), reimburse Pipeline as hereinafter provided for all of Pipeline's reasonable and verifiable costs incurred, allocated and paid as of the date of such termination, or for which Pipeline is contractually obligated to pay (and does pay), as of the date of such termination, solely in conjunction with its efforts to satisfy its obligations under this Precedent Agreement ("Pre-service Costs"), except to the extent such expenses previously have been reimbursed or are reimbursable by Anadarko or by any third party or parties. Pre-service Costs will include those third-party expenditures and/or costs incurred, allocated and paid by Pipeline or for which Pipeline is contractually obligated to pay and does pay, and Pipeline's internal direct and corporate overhead costs allocated to technical services associated with the Project, which shall include engineering, construction, materials and equipment, environmental, land acquisition and any other technically-based costs related to the firm service contemplated in this Precedent Agreement and incurred in furtherance of Pipeline's efforts to satisfy its obligations under this Precedent Agreement. For clarity, the Parties specifically agree that Pre-service Costs will not include internal management and internal legal costs. In addition, identifiable physical assets for which Pipeline is reimbursed pursuant to this Paragraph 9 and not already installed as part of Pipeline's NEB or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission jurisdictional facilities by Pipeline shall become the sole property of Customer, if and to the extent Customer so elects and provides written notice of such election to Pipeline.
 
     (B) Customer's obligations under this Paragraph 9 are subject to Pipeline's fulfillment of Pipeline's periodic reporting requirements and compliance with the milestone-based cost limits with respect to the Project facilities to be applied in connection with this Paragraph 9 as set forth in Schedule B.
     (C) If Pipeline exercises its option to seek reimbursement pursuant to Paragraph 9(A) of this Precedent Agreement, then Pipeline shall, within sixty (60) days of exercising such option in writing, submit to Customer an invoice reflecting the Pre-service Costs for which it seeks reimbursement. Such invoice shall be accompanied by such detailed and supporting documentation as Customer may reasonably request in writing. Customer shall, no later than sixty (60) days following receipt of (i) such invoice and (ii) such detailed and supporting documentation as it may reasonably request in writing (the "Due Date"), pay by electronic funds transfer to an account designated by Pipeline in writing the amount so invoiced by Pipeline; provided that Customer may withhold from such payment the portion, if any, of such invoiced amount that Customer in good faith disputes. In the event that Customer in good faith disputes any portion of such invoiced amount, Customer shall submit to Pipeline on or before the Due Date, in writing and in reasonable detail, an explanation of the reason(s) for such dispute. Customer and Pipeline shall in good faith attempt to promptly resolve any such disputed invoice amount. Any disputed invoice amounts subsequently determined by the Parties or by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 24 to have been properly invoiced by Pipeline shall be paid by Customer within sixty (60) days following such determination, plus interest on late payments and disputed amounts found to be proper with interest determined at the annual prime interest rate announced from time to time
 
of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Calgary, Alberta as a reference rate then in effect for determining interest rates on Canadian dollar commercial loans, plus 200 basis points (the "Prime Rate"), from the date Customer should have paid Pipeline until the date Customer actually pays Pipeline.
     (D) If, within five (5) years from the time Customer pays the Pre-service Costs with respect to the Project facilities, any other expansion project on Pipeline's system results in an executed precedent agreement that contemplates utilization of any of the same facilities contemplated for use by Customer in connection with this Precedent Agreement, Pipeline will pay back to Customer all payments Pipeline has received from Customer or any affiliate thereof for the Project facilities (including all costs reimbursed to Pipeline under the Reimbursement Agreement among Anadarko, Pipeline and Maritimes-U.S. dated May 26, 2004, as amended from time to time); provided that, the obligation of Pipeline to pay back such amount shall be limited to only the amount that Pipeline has received from Customer, Anadarko, or any affiliate thereof in connection with such expansion facilities (i) that Pipeline actually constructs as part of the other expansion or (ii) for which Pipeline actually receives reimbursement from the new expansion shipper(s)The amount required to be paid back pursuant to this Paragraph 9(D), including amounts repaid pursuant to any audit, accounting or dispute resolution procedure hereunder shall also include interest at the Prime Rate, from the date of receipt of such funds by or on behalf of Pipeline until the date of payment in full to Customer. Pipeline shall use a reasonable allocation methodology in determining how to allocate costs among various portions of the Project facilities that have been incurred in connection with the Project facilities but that are not directly attributable to any
.
 
particular portion of such Project facilities. Customer shall have audit rights and the right to an accounting of Pipeline and its affiliates whose costs are subject to a claim for reimbursement hereunder to enforce the provisions of this Paragraph 9 regarding Pre-service Costs. Disputes regarding this Paragraph 9 shall be resolved between the Parties pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 24 below.
     
10.

     (A) If any of the conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 8 of this Precedent Agreement, excluding the condition precedent set forth in Paragraphs 8 (A)(x), 8(B)(iv) and 8(B)(vi), have not been fully satisfied, or waived in writing by Pipeline or Customer, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 8, by the earlier of the applicable dates specified therein (if any) or November 1, 2009, then either Pipeline or Customer may for any such failure to satisfy or to waive thereafter terminate this Precedent Agreement, and the Service Agreement by giving sixty (60) days prior written notice of its intention to terminate to the non-terminating Party; provided, however, if the conditions precedent are satisfied, or waived in writing by Pipeline or Customer, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 8 of this Precedent Agreement, within such sixty (60) day notice period, then such termination will not be effective. In the event notice of termination is provided by either Party, and this Precedent Agreement subsequently is terminated as a result of such notice, Customer's financial obligations with respect to Paragraph 9 of this Precedent Agreement, if any, shall cease to increase as of the date of such notice of termination, with the exception of reasonable and incidental post-termination notice expenses (such as demobilization and contract
 
termination expenses) shown to Customer's reasonable satisfaction, by Pipeline, in writing, to have been required of Pipeline.
     (B) On the latest to occur of (i) the Target Date for Full Service, (ii) November 1, 2009, or (iii) the last day of the second, consecutive full Construction Cycle following the Construction Authorization Date, if Pipeline has not completed construction of the Project facilities and made such facilities available for full service, Customer shall have the right, to be exercised if at all no later than thirty (30) days following the last to occur of the foregoing dates, to terminate this Precedent Agreement by giving sixty (60) days prior written notice of its intention to terminate to Pipeline; provided, however, if Pipeline makes such Project facilities available for full service during such sixty (60) day notice period, then such termination will not be effective. If Customer does not exercise the right it has to terminate this Precedent Agreement under the preceding sentence of this Paragraph 10(B), then the November 1, 2009 date referred to therein and in Paragraph 10(A) shall become November 1, 2011. For purposes of this Paragraph 10(B), "Construction Cycle" shall mean, with respect to any calendar year, the period from June 1 through December 31 of such calendar year, and "Construction Authorization Date" shall mean the date on which Pipeline has received (i) all of the governmental authorizations set forth in Paragraph 8(A)(i) and any of those governmental authorizations set forth in 8(A)(iii) listed as required authorizations in Pipeline's NEB application or required by the NEB as pre-construction authorizations and (ii) Pipeline's management committee authorizations necessary to initiate construction of the Project facilities. Pipeline promptly shall provide written notice of such Construction Authorization Date to Customer. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
 
Paragraph 10(B), Customer shall not have a right to terminate this Precedent Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph 10(B) unless and until Customer's Facilities are completed and available for service.
     (C) With respect to Paragraph 6(B) of this Precedent Agreement, to the extent the good faith estimate of the MN365 toll or the scope of the Project contemplated in the Project Description materially differs from that which forms the basis for this Precedent Agreement, Customer shall have the option but not the obligation to terminate this Precedent Agreement, in Customer's sole discretion, after providing written notice to Pipeline of such election within forty-five (45) days following receipt of such good faith estimate and the Project Description.
     (D) Pipeline shall have the option but not the obligation to terminate this Precedent Agreement in good faith for inability or anticipated inability to meet any one or more of the following conditions precedent, prior to the dates set forth above for satisfaction of such conditions precedent in Paragraph 8(A) of this Precedent Agreement: 8(A)(v) and 8(A)(vi); provided that, Pipeline shall have the option at any time to terminate this Precedent Agreement prior to the date on which the condition precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(A)(ii) is satisfied or waived by Pipeline in writing. Such options shall be exercised by providing notice of termination to Customer in writing.
     (E) Customer shall have the option but not the obligation to terminate this Precedent Agreement in good faith for inability or anticipated inability to meet any one or more of the following conditions precedent, prior to the dates set forth above for
 
satisfaction of such conditions precedent in Paragraph 8(B) of this Precedent Agreement: 8(B)(iii), 8(B)(v) and 8(B)(vii); provided that, Customer shall have the option at any time to terminate this Precedent Agreement prior to the date on which the condition precedent set forth in Paragraph 8(B)(ii) is satisfied or waived by Customer in writing. Such option shall be exercised by providing notice of termination to Pipeline in writing.
     (F) The Parties acknowledge that the availability of LNG supplies to support Customer's Terminal is a necessity for Customer to successfully operate Customer's Terminal, and, accordingly, Customer's access to LNG supplies is a necessity for Pipeline to agree to expand its pipeline system. Therefore, in addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Precedent Agreement, Customer agrees that Pipeline shall have the right to terminate this Precedent Agreement on or after the date on which Pipeline provides Customer with the Project Description, if Customer fails to demonstrate to Pipeline, to Pipeline's satisfaction acting reasonably, that Customer has arranged for an adequate quantity of LNG supplies to support the operation of Customer's Terminal when considering the period covered by the Primary Term of the Service Agreement (such demonstration may include production of LNG supply contracts or other types of written commitments of supply redacted to exclude confidential pricing provisions but which would include the identity of the counterparty to such supply contract(s) (or country in which such supplies are produced) and provisions related to the character of service (i.e., whether such supply is firm or interruptible and the terms related to any potential supply interruption), and the term of the supply agreement(s)). If Pipeline exercises this right to terminate this Precedent Agreement,
 
Pipeline shall provide written notice to Customer on or after the date on which Pipeline provides Customer with the Project Description, stating that Pipeline has elected to terminate this Precedent Agreement under this Paragraph 10, and this Precedent Agreement shall terminate upon delivery of such written notice to Customer. Such termination option shall be exercised, if at all, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Pipeline provides Customer with the Project Description.
     (G) Except as provided in Paragraph 25 hereof, if this Precedent Agreement is not terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 10(A), 10(B), 10(C), 10(D), 10(E) or 10(F) of this Precedent Agreement, then this Precedent Agreement will terminate by its express terms on the Service Commencement Date under the Service Agreement, as provided for in Paragraph 5 of this Precedent Agreement, and thereafter Pipeline's and Customer's rights and obligations related to the transportation transaction contemplated herein shall be determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of such ServiceAgreement and the Tariff, as effective from time to time.
     . Customer will endeavor to satisfy by February 1, 2006, one of the following creditworthiness requirements set forth in Paragraph 11(A) and agrees that, upon written request by Pipeline, Customer shall promptly provide evidence to Pipeline of same:

     (A) Customer (or any entity that guarantees all of Customer's obligations under the Service Agreement for the initial twenty (20) year term of the Service Agreement) shall have an investment grade rating for its long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. of Baa3 or higher or from Standard & Poor's
 
of BBB- or higher. In the event that Customer or its guarantor meets the requirement contained in the immediately preceding sentence initially, but is later downgraded below such investment grade rating, Customer will be required to obtain a guarantee from any affiliate of Customer that is an investment grade rated entity as defined in Paragraph 11(A)provided, that if Customer does not have any affiliates with such investment grade rating, Customer shall be required to satisfy the requirement set forth in Paragraph 11(B).
;
     (B) At any time and from time to time that neither Customer nor its guarantor meets the requirements set forth in the first sentence of Paragraph 11(A), Customer will be accepted as creditworthy by Pipeline if Pipeline reasonably determines that, notwithstanding the absence of such investment grade credit rating, the financial position of Customer (or an entity that guarantees all of Customer's obligations under the Service Agreement for the initial twenty (20) year term of the Service Agreement) is reasonably acceptable to Pipeline and acceptable to Pipeline's Existing Lenders and the Project Lenders.
     (C) The Parties agree that, if and when Pipeline requests evidence in writing of Customer's or its guarantor's ability to satisfy the creditworthiness requirements set forth in Paragraphs 11(A), 11(B) and/or 11(E), and Customer or its guarantor fails, in Pipeline's reasonable discretion, to provide such evidence, Pipeline may suspend its obligations under this Precedent Agreement until Customer or its guarantor has provided such evidence; provided, further, that Pipeline shall first provide Customer with written notice of its intent to suspend performance hereunder (which notice will state whether Pipeline is suspending its obligations due to Customers' noncompliance with
 
Paragraph 11(A), 11(B) and/or 11(E)) and Pipeline shall provide Customer, prior to suspension, with at least 30 days in which to cure the claimed failure to provide such evidence.
     (D) If and to the extent that an entity guarantees Customer's obligations for the initial twenty (20) year term of the Service Agreement and/or for Customer's obligations under this Precedent Agreement, such guarantees shall be in the form, content, and substance as expressly set forth as Schedule C hereto (for the Service Agreement) and Schedule D hereto (for the Precedent Agreement), respectively. Each such guaranty shall be assignable in accordance with its stated terms.
     (E) With respect to Customer's obligations under this Precedent Agreement, Customer, or its guarantor, shall meet the credit rating requirements of Paragraph 11(A). If Customer or its guarantor loses such investment grade rating and if Customer's guarantor is not an affiliate of Customer, then Customer shall endeavour to first provide a guarantee from an affiliate of Customer with an investment grade rating as defined in Paragraph 11(A), and if Customer's guarantor is an affiliate of Customer, then Customer shall endeavour to first provide a guarantee from another affiliate of Customer with an investment grade rating as defined in Paragraph 11(A). If no affiliate of Customer has such investment grade rating, Customer or its guarantor shall provide a standby irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution reasonably acceptable to Pipeline and acceptable to Pipeline's Existing Lenders and Project Lenders ("Letter of Credit") in an amount equal to the applicable estimated Pre-service Costs set forth in Schedule B as of the date on which such assurances are requested, plus the estimated additional costs projected to be incurred for the following twelve months as set forth in
 
Schedule B. The right of Pipeline to suspend its obligations under this Precedent Agreement under Paragraph 11(C) shall not be affected by Customer providing a letter of credit under this Paragraph 11(E); provided, however, if Pipeline provides notice of its intention to suspend performance pursuant to Paragraph 11(C), the Parties agree that Customer may replace any outstanding letters of credit previously posted by Customer pursuant to this Paragraph 11(E) with a replacement Letter of Credit in the amount of the applicable estimated Pre-Service Costs for the next Milestone Event set forth in Schedule B scheduled to occur following the date on which Pipeline provides such notice of suspension; provided further that, in the event Pipeline subsequently resumes performance under this Precedent Agreement after providing notice of suspension (and provides written notice to Customer of Pipeline's resumption of performance), but prior to any termination of this Precedent Agreement, then Customer shall tender an additional Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit posted by Customer during suspension, and (ii) an amount equal to the applicable estimated Pre-service Costs set forth in Schedule B as of the date on which Pipeline suspended performance under this Agreement, plus the estimated additional costs projected to be incurred for the following twelve months as set forth in Schedule B.

Pipeline represents and warrants that (i) it is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the Province of New Brunswick and has all requisite legal power and authority to execute this Precedent Agreement and carry out the terms, conditions and provisions hereof; (ii) this Precedent Agreement constitutes the valid,

Agreement or (separately) the Service Agreement, will, if its predecessor in title is a Party, be entitled to the rights and will be subject to the obligations of its predecessor in title under this Precedent Agreement and the Service Agreement provided that such party, (either the successor to Pipeline or the successor to Customer or any entity guaranteeing the credit of such party), shall be considered creditworthy by the other Party. For purposes of this Paragraph 15, the test of creditworthiness shall be satisfied if such successor or its guarantor satisfies the investment grade rating threshold set forth in the first sentence of Paragraph 11(A). Except as provided in the foregoing sentence and in Paragraphs 16(A) and 16(C) below, neither Customer nor Pipeline may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Precedent Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Each Party agrees to provide the other Party's lenders such reasonable assurances and undertakings as they may require in connection with such assignment, so long as the terms thereof are reasonable and not contrary to market standards for such assurances and undertakings and do not decrease such non-assigning Party's rights or increase its obligations under this Precedent Agreement, or the Service Agreement in any material manner. In addition, each Party shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party to obtain such
 
other Party's financing by supplying such other Party's lenders information concerning the first Party (that is in the first Party's possession and is not of a proprietary or confidential nature) reasonably requested in writing by the other Party's lenders.
     (B) Customer may assign either all of its rights and obligations in or an undivided interest to its rights and obligations under this Precedent Agreement and all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Service Agreement to a subsidiary, affiliate, co-venturer, joint venture entity or other third party; provided that, each such assignee of rights and obligations under this Precedent Agreement and/or the Service Agreement executes a new firm service agreement under Rate Schedule MN365 covering the rights and obligations which have been assigned to it. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph 16(B), no assignment of all of Customer's rights under either this Precedent Agreement or the Service Agreement (other than assignments made pursuant to Paragraph 16(C) below) under this Paragraph 16(B) will release Customer of any of its obligations under this Precedent Agreement, until Customer receives the prior written consent of Pipeline, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or unduly delayed; provided, that Pipeline agrees that it will promptly provide such consent, if (i) such assignee or its guarantor has an investment grade credit rating as defined in Paragraph 11(A) hereof; and (ii) such assignee possesses, in Pipeline's reasonable discretion, the requisite technical expertise or the demonstrated ability to acquire the requisite technical expertise to complete Customer's Terminal and Customer's Facilities in a timely manner to meet the Service Commencement Date under the Service Agreement

     (C) Customer may assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Service Agreement to any party; provided that, each such assignee executes a new firm service agreement under Rate Schedule MN365 substantially identical in all respects (other than the quantity of natural gas to be transported in the event ofassignments to more than one party of partial undivided interests) with the Service Agreement covering the rights and obligations which have been assigned to it.
ANY SUCH ASSIGNMENT HEREUNDER SHALL, WITH RESPECT TO THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CUSTOMER SO ASSIGNED, FULLY, COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY DISCHARGE, RELEASE AND TERMINATE CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SERVICE AGREEMENT AND THE NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENT FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH ASSIGNMENT FORWARD, AND IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ENTITY GUARANTEES CUSTOMER'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PRECEDENT AGREEMENT AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE TERMS OF

     (D) Notwithstanding any other provision of Paragraphs 16(B) or 16(C) of this Precedent Agreement, Customer may not assign any rights or obligations as contemplated under Paragraph 16(B) or 16(C) to any entity, unless (i) the assignee (or assignee's guarantor) has an investment grade credit rating as defined in the first sentence of Paragraph 11(A) of this Precedent Agreement, and (ii) the assignment is implemented prior to the earlier of the Initial Commencement Date or the Service Commencement Date. After the Initial Commencement Date, any assignment of firm capacity must be effectuated pursuant to the provisions of the Tariff.

This Precedent Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall, if both Parties execute a counterpart, be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The facsimile transmission of any signed original of this Precedent Agreement, and transmission or retransmission of any signed facsimile transmission, shall be the same as delivery of an original. At the request of either Party, the Parties will confirm facsimile transmitted signatures by signing an original document for delivery between them.
23. 
Multiple Counterparts
     (A) Any controversy, cause of action, dispute or claim arising out of, relating to, or in connection with, this Precedent Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity hereof (collectively a "Dispute"), shall be settled solely, exclusively and finally through mandatory and binding arbitration, to which the Parties hereby agree to submit, it being the intention of the Parties that this is a broad form
24. 
Dispute Resolution
 
arbitration agreement designed to encompass all possible Disputes between the Parties relating to this Precedent Agreement.
     (B) A Party shall not be permitted to submit a Dispute to arbitration under this Precedent Agreement unless such Party provides the other Party prior notice of its intention to submit such Dispute to arbitration hereunder. Such notice shall, in reasonable detail, identify the grounds for such Dispute. Following the receipt of such notice, executive officers of the Parties, or their designees, shall immediately, for a period of ten (10) consecutive working days, use reasonable commercial efforts to resolve and settle such Dispute. If the executive officers of the Parties, or their designees, are able to resolve such Dispute during such period, the Parties shall prepare and sign a written memorandum setting forth the terms of such resolution, which shall be binding upon the Parties. Failing such resolution and settlement within such period, either Party shall have the right to submit such Dispute to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Precedent Agreement. With respect to any Dispute, all applicable statutory limitations periods and defenses based upon the passage of time will be tolled for the duration of the negotiations provided for above and for the duration of the arbitration proceedings set forth in this Paragraph 24.
     (C) All arbitration procedures under this Precedent Agreement shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") of the National Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. ("ADRI"), as amended and in effect from time to time. All arbitration procedures shall be administered by the ADRI. The tribunal for the arbitration shall consist of three arbitratorsall of whom shall be independent of the parties and impartial, one to be designated by each Party and the
,
 
third to be selected by the mutual written agreement of the two arbitrators. In the event either Party fails to appoint an arbitrator, or if the two arbitrators appointed by the Parties fail to reach agreement on a third arbitrator, the ADRI shall select such arbitrator(s). Each Party shall designate its arbitrator within twenty (20) days of receiving a demand to arbitrate. Prior to acceptance of appointment as an arbitrator, each arbitrator shall have read and affirmatively agreed to observe all provisions of the ADRI's Arbitration and Mediation Institute of Canada Code of Ethics for Arbitrators and Mediators. THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LAWS OF THE PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA (EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICT OF LAWS OR CHOICE OF LAWS RULES OR PRINCIPLES AS APPLIED IN NOVA SCOTIA) SHALL APPLY. The choice of Nova Scotia law shall not be interpreted as a choice to exclude applicability of the federal law to the enforceability and scope of this arbitration provision. It is therefore specifically understood that both Nova Scotia and federal law, neither to the exclusion of the other, shall apply to the enforceability and scope of this provision, and, in the event of a conflict between Nova Scotia and federal law, the law maximizing the enforceability and scope of this provision, including laws relating to appellate remedies, may be invoked, without excluding applicability of other law, by the Party seeking to compel arbitration. If, for purposes of determining Nova Scotia or federal law, a conflict or difference of opinion exists between provincial courts and federal courts, as the case may be, this arbitration provision shall be interpreted to select the precedent of that provincial court or that federal court that maximizes the enforceability and scope of this arbitration provision. All arbitrations hereunder shall take place in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Parties specifically agree that the judgment or award of the tribunal shall be final
 
and binding on each Party and for all purposes. Judgment upon an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of this Precedent Agreement. Should the Parties ever be prevented by applicable law from utilizing arbitration to resolve Disputes hereunder, then the choice of law provisions of Paragraph 20 shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the Parties shall submit such Disputes to the exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate court located in Halifax, Nova Scotia (to whose exclusive jurisdiction the Parties hereby agree to submit). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Paragraph 24 shall be construed in any manner to exclude, qualify, limit or condition the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of the NEB (as well as the Federal Court of Canada that may review decisions of the NEB) over matters, disputes or controversies within the scope of the NEB's exclusive or primary jurisdiction, or limit, qualify or condition the right of either Party to present, prosecute or defend its interests before the NEB or reviewing courts.
     . Notwithstanding any termination of this Precedent Agreement, the provisions of Paragraphs 4(B), 7, 9, 11(D), 12, 13, 17, 20, 21, 22 and 24 of this Precedent Agreement shall survive such termination pursuant to their respective terms.

Contract No. 210099
     This Service Agreement is made and entered into this 29 day of June, 2005, by and between Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. (herein called "Pipeline") and Anadarko LNG Marketing, LLC (herein called "Customer", whether one or more),
th
WHEREAS, Customer and Pipeline are parties to a precedent agreement dated as of even date herewith ("Precedent Agreement"), pursuant to which Pipeline will expand its existing system to make available additional pipeline capacity on its system;
WHEREAS, Customer desires that Pipeline transport gas for Customer's account subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Pipeline's Rate Schedule MN365; and
WHEREAS, Pipeline desires to transport gas for Customer's account subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Pipeline's Rate Schedule MN365.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties do covenant and agree as follows:
     Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof, of Pipeline's Rate Schedule MN365, and of the GT&C, transportation service hereunder will be firm and Pipeline agrees to deliver for Customer's account quantities of natural gas up to the following quantity:
Notwithstanding the foregoing, commencing on the Initial Commencement Date, as that term is defined in the Precedent Agreement, the MDTQ shall be a quantity equal to the Initial MDTQ, as determined pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 5 of the Precedent Agreement, and the MATQ shall be a quantity equal to the product of such Initial MDTQ multiplied by 365. From and after the Service Commencement Date, as that term is defined in the Precedent Agreement, this paragraph shall be of no further force or effect and the MDTQ and MATQ shall be as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph.
 
Contract No. 210099
     Pipeline will receive for Customer's account for transportation hereunder daily quantities of gas up to Customer's MDTQ, plus Fuel Retainage Quantity, at Point(s) of Receipt as specified in Article IV herein. Pipeline will transport and deliver for Customer's account such daily quantities tendered up to such Customer's MDTQ (and, on a cumulative basis, the MATQ) at Point(s) of Delivery as specified in Article IV herein.
     On any given Day, Pipeline shall not be obligated to, but may at its sole discretion, receive at Point(s) of Receipt quantities of gas in excess of Pipeline's Maximum Daily Receipt Obligation (MDRO), plus Fuel Retainage Quantity, but shall not receive in the aggregate at all Points of Receipt on any day a quantity of gas in excess of the applicable MDTQ, plus Fuel Retainage Quantity. On any given day, Pipeline shall not be obligated to, but may at its sole discretion, deliver at any Point of Delivery quantities of gas in excess of Pipeline's Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO), but shall not deliver in the aggregate at all Points of delivery on any day quantities of gas in excess of the applicable MDTQ.
     Service under this Agreement shall commence on the earlier of the Initial Commencement Date or the Service Commencement Date, as such terms are defined in the Precedent Agreement, and shall continue in effect for a term ending twenty (20) years after the Service Commencement Date, as such term is defined in the Precedent Agreement ("Primary Term") and shall remain in force from year to year thereafter unless terminated by either party by two (2) years written notice prior to the end of the Primary Term or any successive term thereafter. Customer agrees that Pipeline may terminate this Service Agreement at any time subject to the provisions of Sections 4 and 16 of the GT&C and such provisions are incorporated herein by reference. If the Precedent Agreement terminates for a reason other than pursuant to Paragraph 10(F) thereof, then upon such termination, this Service Agreement shall terminate and have no further force or effect.
     
THIS SERVICE AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED A "ROFR AGREEMENT" UNDER THE GT&C OF PIPELINE'S FERC GAS TARIFF, AND THE PROVISION OF A TERMINATION NOTICE BY EITHER CUSTOMER OR PIPELINE, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE II, OR THE EXPIRATION OF THIS SERVICE AGREEMENT BY ITS OWN TERMS TRIGGERS CUSTOMER'S RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL UNDER SECTION 4.2 OF THE GT&C OF PIPELINE'S FERC GAS TARIFF.
     Any portions of this Service Agreement necessary to correct or cash-out imbalances or to make payment under this Service Agreement as required by the GT&C will survive the other parts of this Service
 
Contract No. 210099
Agreement until such time as such balancing or payment has been accomplished. To the extent that Customer desires to terminate this Service Agreement and Pipeline agrees to such termination, Pipeline will collect as part of the exit fee all (or such lesser portion as Pipeline agrees to) of the capacity Reservation Charges otherwise recoverable by Pipeline from Customer for the balance of the contractual term, absent such early termination.
     For the entire period when this Service Agreement is in effect, this Service Agreement will be subject to all provisions of Rate Schedule MN365 and the GT&C of Pipeline's Tariff on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, all of which are by this reference made a part hereof.
     Customer agrees to and will pay Pipeline all Reservation, Usage and other charges and fees provided for in Rate Schedule MN365, as effective from time to time, for service under this Service Agreement. In the event Pipeline and Customer agree to a discounted rate for a specified term of service hereunder, provisions governing such discounted rate and term shall be applicable, and shall be as specified in the Discount Confirmation to this Service Agreement. In the event Pipeline and Customer agree to a negotiated rate for a specified term of service hereunder, provisions governing such negotiated rate and term shall be applicable, and shall be as specified in the written negotiated rate agreement between Customer and Pipeline and reflected on an appropriate rate sheet filed as part of Pipeline's Tariff.
     Customer agrees that Pipeline shall have the unilateral right to file with the appropriate regulatory authority and make changes effective in: (i) the rates and charges applicable to service pursuant to Pipeline's Rate Schedule MN365 and under this FERC Gas Tariff; (ii) Pipeline's Rate Schedule MN365; and/or (iii) any provision of the GT&C under Pipeline's Tariff. Customer shall have the right to take any position before the appropriate regulatory authority in response to any filing contemplated in this paragraph, unless Customer has otherwise agreed not to take a particular position.
     The Point(s) of Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery at which Pipeline shall receive and deliver gas, respectively, shall be specified in Exhibit(s) A and B of this effective Service Agreement. The Point(s) of Measurement shall be specified in Exhibit A of this effective Service Agreement.
 
Contract No. 210099
     Exhibit(s) A and B are hereby incorporated as part of this Service Agreement for all intents and purposes as if fully copied and set forth herein at length.
     All natural gas tendered to Pipeline for Customer's account shall conform to the quality specifications set forth in Section 12 of Pipeline's GT&C. Customer agrees that if Customer tenders gas for service hereunder and Pipeline accepts such gas which does not comply with Pipeline's quality specifications, Customer will pay all costs associated with processing of such gas as necessary to comply with such quality specifications.
     Except as herein otherwise provided or as provided in the GT&C, any notice, request, demand, statement, invoice or payment provided for in this Service Agreement, or any notice which any party desires to give to the other, must be in writing and will be considered as duly delivered when mailed by registered, certified, or regular mail to the post office address of the parties hereto, as the case may be, as follows:

     Any Company which succeeds by purchase, merger, or consolidation to the properties, substantially as an entirety, of Customer or of Pipeline will be entitled to the rights and will be subject to the obligations of its predecessor in title under this Service Agreement. Either Customer or Pipeline may assign or pledge this Service Agreement under the provisions of any mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, bank credit agreement, assignment, receivable sale, or similar instrument which it has executed or may execute hereafter. Except as set forth above, neither Customer nor Pipeline shall assign this Service Agreement or any of its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that neither Customer nor Pipeline shall be released from its obligations hereunder without the consent of the other.

     WHEREAS, Customer has requested and Pipeline has agreed to transport quantities of gas that are delivered by Customer or Customer's agent to Pipeline pursuant to the terms of this Service Agreement.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties do covenant and agree as follows:
     Capitalized terms herein not otherwise defined shall have the meaning attributed thereto in Pipeline's Toll Schedule MN365, the GT&C of Pipeline's Tariff on file with the National Energy Board and that Precedent Agreement dated June 29, 2005 between Pipeline and Customer.
     Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof, of Pipeline's Toll Schedule MN365, and of the GT&C, transportation service hereunder will be firm and Pipeline agrees to deliver for Customer's account quantities of natural gas up to the following quantity:
     Maximum Daily Transportation Quantity (MDTQ) = 857,444 GJ
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, commencing on the Initial Commencement Date, as that term is defined in the Precedent Agreement, the MDTQ shall be a quantity equal to the Initial MDTQ, as determined pursuant to the terms of Paragraph 5 of the Precedent Agreement. From and after the Service Commencement Date, as that term is defined in the Precedent Agreement, this paragraph shall be of no further force or effect and the MDTQ shall be as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph.
     Pipeline will receive for Customer's account for transportation hereunder daily quantities of gas up to Customer's MDTQ, plus Fuel Retainage Quantity, at Point(s) of Receipt as specified in Article IV herein. Pipeline will transport and deliver for Customer's account such daily quantities tendered up to such Customer's MDTQ at Point(s) of Delivery as specified in Article IV herein.
 
     On any given Day, Pipeline shall not be obligated to, but may at its sole discretion, receive at Point(s) of Receipt quantities of gas in excess of Pipeline's Maximum Daily Receipt Obligation (MDRO), plus Fuel Retainage Quantity, but shall not be obligated to receive in the aggregate at all Points of Receipt on any Day a quantity of gas in excess of the applicable MDTQ, plus Fuel Retainage Quantity. On any given Day, Pipeline shall not be obligated to, but may at its sole discretion, deliver at Point(s) of Delivery quantities of gas in excess of Pipeline's Maximum Daily Delivery Obligation (MDDO), but shall not be obligated to deliver in the aggregate at all Points of Delivery on any Day a quantity of gas in excess of the applicable MDTQ.
     This Service Agreement shall become effective as of the date set forth hereinabove. Service under this Service Agreement shall commence on the earlier of the Initial Commencement Date or the Service Commencement Date, as such terms are defined in the Precedent Agreement, and shall become effective as of the date set forth hereinabove and shall continue in effect for a term of twenty (20) years from the Service Commencement Date ("Primary Term") and shall remain in force from year to year thereafter unless terminated by either party by written notice at least two years prior to the end of the Primary Term or any successive term thereafter.
     Customer agrees that Pipeline may terminate this Service Agreement at any time subject to the provisions of Articles 4 and 16 of the GT&C and such provisions are incorporated herein by reference. If the Precedent Agreement terminates for a reason other than pursuant to Paragraph 10(G) thereof, then upon such termination, this Service Agreement shall promptly terminate and have no further force or effect .
     Any portions of this Service Agreement necessary to correct or cash-out imbalances or to make payment under this Service Agreement as required by the GT&C will survive the other parts of this Service Agreement until such time as such balancing or payment has been accomplished. To the extent that Customer desires to terminate this Service Agreement and Pipeline agrees to such termination, Pipeline will collect as part of the exit fee all (or such lesser portion as Pipeline agrees to) of the capacity Reservation Charges and surcharges otherwise recoverable by Pipeline from Customer for the balance of the contractual term, absent such early termination.
     For the entire period when this Service Agreement is in effect, this Service Agreement will be subject to all provisions of Toll Schedule MN365 and the GT&C of Pipeline's Tariff on file with the National Energy Board, all of which are by this reference made a part hereof.
     Customer agrees to and will pay Pipeline all Reservation, Usage and other charges and fees provided for in Toll Schedule MN365, as effective from time to time, for service under this Service Agreement, provided that from the earlier of (i) the Initial
 
Commencement Date, or (ii) the Service Commencement Date and continuing for a period of ninety (90) days the tolls paid by Customer will be applied only to quantities actually flowed under this Service Agreement and not to the MDTQ under this Service Agreement; provided further, that Customer shall have a minimum payment obligation during this ninety (90) day period of twenty-five percent (25%) of the MDTQ multiplied by the MN365 Reservation Charge.
     Customer agrees that Pipeline shall have the unilateral right to file with the appropriate regulatory authority and make changes effective in: (i) the tolls and charges applicable to service pursuant to Pipeline's Toll Schedule MN365 and under the Tariff; (ii) Pipeline's Toll Schedule MN365; and/or (iii) any provision of the GT&C under the Tariff. Customer shall have the right to intervene and protest any such filing.
     The Point(s) of Receipt and Point(s) of Delivery at which Pipeline shall receive and deliver gas, respectively, shall be specified in Exhibits A and B of this effective Service Agreement.
     Exhibits A and B are hereby incorporated as part of this Service Agreement for all intents and purposes as if fully copied and set forth herein at length.
     All natural gas tendered to Pipeline for Customer's account shall conform to the quality specifications set forth in Article 12 of Pipeline's GT&C. Customer agrees that if Customer tenders gas for service hereunder and Pipeline accepts such gas which does not comply with Pipeline's quality specifications, Customer will pay all costs associated with processing of such gas as necessary to comply with such quality specifications.
 
     Except as herein otherwise provided or as provided in the GT&C, any notice, request, demand, statement, invoice or payment provided for in this Service Agreement, or any notice which any party desires to give to the other, must be in writing and will be considered as duly delivered when mailed by registered, certified, or regular mail to the post office address of the parties hereto, as the case may be, as follows:
or such other address as either party designates by formal written notice.
     Any Company which succeeds by purchase, merger, or consolidation to the properties, substantially or in entirety, of Customer or of Pipeline will be entitled to the rights and will be subject to the obligations of its predecessor in title under this Service Agreement. Either Customer or Pipeline may assign or pledge this Service Agreement under the provisions of any mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, bank credit agreement, assignment, receivable sale, or similar instrument which it has executed or may execute hereafter.

     Customer shall have the right to designate an agent or person to provide nomination and scheduling information, to receive invoices and make payments and to take actions necessary to release capacity and handle imbalance resolutions for Customer on Customer's behalf. The agent may be the same as used for similar purposes with respect to transportation on Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. or other third party pipeline. Customer must provide Pipeline with ten (10) Business Days' advance written notice of its agent and the effective date after which Pipeline is to act in accordance with the direction of the agent. Pipeline shall be entitled to rely on the representations, actions, and other directions of the agent on behalf of Customer and will be fully protected in relying upon such agent. Customer indemnifies and holds Pipeline harmless with respect to actions taken by Pipeline in reliance on Customer's agent.
     Customer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Pipeline is a New Brunswick limited partnership; (b) Customer shall have no recourse against any partner of Pipeline or against Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. or a member thereof with respect to Pipeline's obligations under this Service Agreement and that its sole recourse shall be against the assets and revenues of Pipeline, irrespective of any failure to comply with applicable law or any provision of this Service Agreement; (c) no claim shall be made against any partner of Pipeline or against Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. or a member thereof under or in connection with this Service Agreement; (d) no claims shall be made against the Operator, its officers, employees, and agents, under or in connection with this Service Agreement and the performance of its duties as Operator (provided that this shall not bar claims resulting from the gross negligence, undue discrimination or willful misconduct of the Operator) and Customer shall provide the Operator with a waiver of subrogation of Customer's insurance company for all such claims; and (e) this representation is made expressly for the benefit of the partners in Pipeline, the General Partner, Operator, Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. and its members.

NEWS
HOUSTON, June 30, 2005  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC) today announced it has signed agreements for nominated capacity on a planned expansion of the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline (M&NP) system to deliver volumes into Canadian and U.S. markets from Anadarko's Bear Head liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal, which will be constructed in Nova Scotia.
     "This is a critical step in Anadarko's development of an integrated LNG project," said Karl Kurz, Anadarko Senior Vice President, Marketing and General Manager, U.S. Onshore. "With transportation arrangements now secured into premier North American natural gas markets, Anadarko has added value and visibility to the project while we continue to move forward with LNG supply negotiations."
     M&NP's proposed expansion would allow their system to accommodate Anadarko's initial Bear Head sendout capacity of 750 million cubic feet per day to markets in eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. The Bear Head terminal site on Point Tupper is approximately 35 miles from the existing pipeline.
     Anadarko acquired the Bear Head terminal project in August 2004. Construction planning, site clearing and leveling, and construction of access roads for the Bear Head terminal began in late 2004 to prepare the site for major construction in 2005. In April, Anadarko entered into an agreement with Horton CBI Limited for engineering services and procurement of certain materials necessary for the construction of two 180,000-cubic-meter LNG storage tanks. Bidders also have been short-listed to participate in the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the terminal, which is expected to be awarded in late 2005.
     First deliveries through the Bear Head terminal are targeted for late 2008.
     Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by developing, acquiring and exploring for oil and gas resources vital to the world's health and welfare. As of year-end 2004, the company had 2.37 billion BOE of proved reserves, making it one of the world's largest independent exploration and production companies. Anadarko's operational focus extends from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, up through Texas, Louisiana, the Mid-Continent, western U.S. and Canadian Rockies and onto the North Slope of Alaska. Anadarko also has significant production in Algeria, Venezuela and Qatar, and exploration or production positions in several other countries.

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Anadarko believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. No assurance, however, can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this news release. Such factors include the ability to obtain access to upstream supplies of LNG on commercially reasonable terms; competition for transportation capacity and market demand; realized gas price assumptions to include regional basis differentials and transportation charges; pipeline cost overruns; capacity turnbacks impacting rates; changes in gas quality specifications; gas supplies satisfying market demand prior to such time as the Bear Head terminal is operational; the ability to respond to challenges in international markets (including changes in currency exchange rates); the potential exercise by M&NP of options to terminate the transaction; the timely receipt of future U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorizations by M&NP; and other factors and risks identified in the "Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements.
