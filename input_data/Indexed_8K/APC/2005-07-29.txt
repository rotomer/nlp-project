Exhibit 99 Anadarko Announces Strong Second Quarter Results HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 29, 2005--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced second quarter 2005 net income available to common shareholders of $506 million, or $2.12 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.59 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $795 million in the second quarter, and discretionary cash flow totaled $930 million.(1) "Anadarko had another quarter of strong financial and operating results," said Anadarko President and CEO Jim Hackett. "Our restructured portfolio delivered higher margins, as revenues climbed 10 percent on strong net realized oil and natural gas prices while overall costs fell, including a 24 percent decline in interest expense due to a $1.4 billion reduction in total debt compared with last year's second quarter. These factors, coupled with a 6 percent reduction in average outstanding shares due to our stock buy-back program, helped Anadarko deliver a 33 percent increase in earnings per share. "In addition, we improved our net debt (or debt less cash) to total capital ratio to 22 percent, versus 34 percent at this time last year," Hackett added. Updating the company's stock buy-back program, Hackett said the company acquired another 1.8 million shares in July for $160 million, bringing the total shares repurchased to 24.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, or a net average cost of $67.50 per share, since the $2 billion program was authorized in June 2004. Sales volumes totaled 39 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in the quarter, or 428,000 BOE per day. Natural gas sales volumes averaged 1,434 million cubic feet per day, at an average realized price of $6.25 per thousand cubic feet. Oil sales volumes in the second quarter averaged 149,000 barrels per day, with an average realized price of $46.55 per barrel. Natural gas liquids volumes were strong, averaging 40,000 barrels per day, as the higher average realized price of $29.70 per barrel encouraged incremental liquid recovery, which reduced reported natural gas volumes. Overall volumes were down compared with the second quarter 2004 due to property sales associated with Anadarko's refocused strategy. Adjusting for these property sales, volumes have increased more than 10 percent year-over-year. Second quarter 2004 net income available to common shareholders was $405 million, or $1.59 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.44 billion. Cash flow from operating activities for the same period was $880 million, while discretionary cash flow totaled $889 million.(1) "Operationally, our exploration and development program continues to deliver very good results on all fronts," Hackett said. "Onshore North America, our existing core properties remain solid contributors, with some exciting exploration underway. Our deepwater Gulf of Mexico portfolio is growing, with first volumes from the K2 field produced during the quarter, along with the Genghis Khan discovery and good preliminary exploration results at the Knotty Head prospect. "Furthermore, sustainability of our growth model gained visibility with the addition and advancement of international projects including offshore North Africa, West Africa, the Georgia Black Sea, Qatar and Indonesia, as well as onshore Algeria and Tunisia and at our Bear Head LNG project in Nova Scotia," Hackett said. "We are very encouraged by the success we've seen through mid-year and expect to continue executing the refocused strategy we initiated last summer." EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL TODAY AT 9:00 A.M. CDT, 10:00 A.M.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures Below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to discretionary cash flow (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company uses discretionary cash flow to demonstrate the company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities.
