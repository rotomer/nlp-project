Exhibit 99.1 Anadarko Announces Record Results HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 6, 2006--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced record fourth-quarter and full-year 2005 net income and highlighted exploration and development results that are expected to contribute to future growth. "The strength in oil and natural gas prices, along with operational improvements and an accretive share repurchase program, combined to make 2005 a very successful year," Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO Jim Hackett said. FOURTH-QUARTER 2005 RESULTS Fourth-quarter net income available to common shareholders was $874 million, or $3.73 per share (diluted), on revenues of $2.25 billion. Net income included costs associated with certain legal proceedings and international impairments amounting to $84 million after-tax, or 36 cents per share (diluted), partially offset by unrealized gains on commodity-related derivatives and gains from the company's firm transportation keep-whole agreement that totaled $50 million after-tax, or 21 cents per share (diluted). Net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $405 million, or $1.64 per share (diluted), on revenues of $1.62 billion. Fourth-quarter 2004 net income included international impairments, legal settlements and charges related to the refocused strategy, partially offset by unrealized gains on commodity-related derivatives and gains from the firm transportation keep-whole agreement, together totaling $71 million after taxes, or 29 cents per share (diluted). Cash flow from operating activities was $1.27 billion in the fourth quarter, and discretionary cash flow totaled $1.59 billion.(1) Sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids in the fourth quarter totaled 39 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), or 429,000 BOE per day. Natural gas sales volumes averaged 1,386 million cubic feet per day, at an average price of $9.94 per thousand cubic feet. Oil sales volumes in the fourth quarter averaged 164,000 barrels per day, with an average price of $52.16 per barrel. Natural gas liquids sales volumes averaged 34,000 barrels per day, at an average price of $39.16 per barrel. Overall sales volumes were up slightly from the third quarter 2005, despite the continued temporary impact of hurricanes on significant Gulf of Mexico development projects, and were down year-over-year due to asset divestitures associated with Anadarko's 2004 refocused strategy. "Anadarko's fourth-quarter performance was a strong finish to a watershed year," Hackett said. "Revenues set an all-time quarterly record, while at the same time we reduced direct operating costs 21 percent from the prior-year period. As a result, we were able to continue expanding our cash margins, partly because of higher commodity prices, but also due to a restructured, more efficient asset base." In October, Anadarko completed a $2 billion stock repurchase program that began in June 2004. In November, the board of directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program, under which Anadarko bought back 2.7 million shares for $246 million by year-end. Since inception of these two programs, 31.1 million shares were purchased at an average cost of $72.33 per share (including all transaction costs), versus a year-end stock price of $94.75 per share. FULL-YEAR 2005 RESULTS Anadarko reported full-year 2005 net income available to common shareholders of $2.47 billion, or $10.39 per share (diluted), on revenues of $7.1 billion. Net income in 2004 was $1.6 billion, or $6.36 per share (diluted), on revenues of $6.08 billion. Cash flow from operating activities totaled $4.15 billion in 2005. Discretionary cash flow totaled $4.42 billion.(1) Sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids for 2005 totaled 158 million BOE, down from 2004 volumes of 190 million BOE due to asset divestitures. Adjusted for these property sales, volumes increased 5 percent in 2005 compared to the prior year. "Our refocused strategy delivered good results in 2005, with record earnings and cash flows generated by a smaller asset portfolio," Hackett said. "Our $3.4 billion capital program funded exploration and development activity designed to provide volume growth for years to come. In addition to the capital program, we returned about $1.3 billion to stakeholders through share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction, and still ended the year with $739 million of cash. We entered 2006 with a diverse portfolio of opportunities and a strong, flexible balance sheet, with debt-less-cash-on-hand representing 21 percent of capitalization." PROVED RESERVES Anadarko added 291 million BOE of proved reserves, ending 2005 with a total of 2.45 billion BOE, up 6 percent from year-end 2004 excluding sales of reserves in place. This is the 24th consecutive year that Anadarko has more than replaced annual production with new proved reserves. Reserve additions in 2005 came primarily from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (including major existing development projects and the Cheyenne, Genghis Khan and Knotty Head discoveries) and fields in the North Louisiana Vernon, East Texas Bossier, West Texas Haley, Wyoming Salt Creek and Canadian Wild River areas. Anadarko's year-end 2005 proved reserves remain nearly balanced between natural gas (54 percent, or 7.9 trillion cubic feet) and liquids (46 percent, or 1.1 billion barrels), which include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. "Anadarko's drilling program has continued to achieve organic reserve replacement rates above its peers. In 2005, our reserve additions significantly exceeded the reserves we produced," Hackett said. "Our unconventional-resource focus onshore North America has yielded solid, lower-risk and highly economic reserve additions, while exploratory success in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and new initiatives underway internationally position us for continued reserve growth in the future." CONFERENCE CALL TOMORROW AT 9 A.M. CST, 10 A.M. EST Anadarko will host a conference call on Tuesday, Feb. 7, at 9 a.m. Central Standard Time (10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) to discuss 2005 results and the company's outlook for 2006. The dial-in number is 913-981-4900, and the confirmation number is 3986947.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures Below is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to discretionary cash flow (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company uses discretionary cash flow to demonstrate the company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities.

Exhibit 99.2 Anadarko Announces 2006 Budget HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--February 6, 2006--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced a 2006 capital budget of approximately $4 billion. The program is expected to deliver 4 to 8 percent production volume growth in 2006, or 165 million to 171 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), over 2005 volumes of 158 million BOE. It also includes substantial investments in exploration and development activities expected to sustain volume growth beyond 2006. Anadarko expects to more than replace annual production for the 25th consecutive year. "Anadarko's exploration-oriented program is designed to deliver differentiating volume growth over time," said Jim Hackett, Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO. "We will continue to invest substantial capital in 2006 to gradually bring major existing discoveries on line through 2008, while also investing about a fifth of our budget in exploration programs. Although project delays experienced due to unusual weather patterns and mechanical issues in the Gulf of Mexico have deferred a small portion of the full-year volume growth targeted for 2006, daily production volumes are expected to increase 15 to 20 percent from January through December 2006. As a result, we will be positioned to grow more than 9 percent in 2007." Approximately 70 percent of the total budget is planned for development activities, 20 percent will go to exploration and the remainder is set aside for capitalized interest, overhead and other items. 2006 CAPITAL BUDGET BY AREA U.S. Onshore 51% Deepwater GOM 23% Canada 11% International 7% Capitalized Items and Other 8% The largest single portion of the 2006 budget will focus on Anadarko's continued success in unconventional tight gas plays onshore North America, primarily in North Louisiana, West Texas, East Texas and Alberta, Canada. In the Gulf of Mexico, two focus areas will combine to represent about one-fifth of total spending. Eastern Gulf of Mexico activity will require more than 10 percent of the budget to install facilities that will link seven Anadarko-operated natural gas discoveries with the Independence Hub development project, which is expected to start up in the second half of 2007. Another 10 percent of the budget is dedicated to the foldbelt area, where Anadarko expects to bring six incremental high-volume wells on line at the K2, K2 North and Genghis Khan discoveries through the Marco Polo hub facility, in addition to participation in 7 to 9 exploration and delineation wells targeting similar Miocene objectives. Outside North America, the largest area of budgeted expenditures is Algeria, where the company expects to make significant progress on the development of Block 208 discoveries, with new production facilities scheduled to come on-line in 2008. The international program also includes exploration activity in Algeria, Qatar, Indonesia, Tunisia and West Africa, as well as activities within other potential new venture areas. "Nearly 60 percent of the 2006 budget is targeting projects that are expected to provide little or no volume growth this year but should contribute to strong growth in 2007 and beyond," Hackett said. "Much of the spending is on major development projects where production is gradually escalating through 2008, and on long-term exploration efforts that, again, target future reserves and production growth. We are confident that shareholders will recognize the value as we execute on the strategy." DETAILED FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON 2006 GUIDANCE FOLLOWS CONFERENCE CALL TOMORROW AT 9 A.M. CST, 10 A.M. EST Anadarko will host a conference call on Tuesday, Feb. 7, at 9 a.m. Central Standard Time (10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) to discuss 2005 results and the company's outlook for 2006.
