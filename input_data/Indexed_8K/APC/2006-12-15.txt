Item 5.02(e) Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
James T. Hackett  Amended and Restated Employment Agreement
On December 11, 2006, the Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company"), upon recommendation by the Board's Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Compensation Committee"), approved a new Employment Agreement between the Company and James T. Hackett, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The agreement replaces Mr. Hackett's previous Employment Agreement and Change of Control Contract.
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Hackett receives a minimum annual base salary of $1,400,000, and is eligible for an annual cash bonus at a target of 130%, not to exceed 260%, of annual base salary. The agreement also outlines certain payments and benefits to be paid to Mr. Hackett under various termination scenarios, including the following:

The Company will provide a gross-up payment to Mr. Hackett to the extent any of the above payments become subject to the federal excise tax relating to golden parachute payments. Pre-Change of Control severance benefits are conditioned upon Mr. Hackett's and the Company's execution of a mutual release.
Mr. Hackett is also subject to covenants regarding confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation. The non-competition obligation applies for one year following Mr. Hackett's termination of employment with the Company if Mr. Hackett voluntarily terminates his employment with the Company (other than for Good Reason) on or before December 3, 2010. If Mr. Hackett remains employed by the Company until at least December 3, 2008, the agreement also provides Mr. Hackett with a special pension benefit, computed so that his total pension benefits from the Company will equal those to which he would have been entitled if his actual years of employment with the Company were doubled.
The above description is not a full summary of all of the terms and conditions of the agreement and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Form of Performance Unit Agreement
On December 11, 2006, the Compensation Committee adopted a form of performance unit agreement under the Company's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan. All executive officers will be eligible to receive awards pursuant to the performance unit agreement.
Under the performance unit agreement, a participant may earn up to a certain number of "performance units." Each performance unit represents the value of one share of the Company's common stock. Payout of performance units is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance goals, based on total shareholder return relative to a predetermined peer group and reserve replacement efficiency, over a predetermined performance period, as described further in the agreement. Performance units earned for a given performance period will only be issued to a participant following the Compensation Committee's review and certification of the actual performance results for the applicable performance period. The Compensation Committee may cause the Company to pay out an award in cash, shares of Company common stock, or a combination of both.
A participant will receive the "target" amount of performance units in the event of death, disability, change of control, or involuntary termination (as such terms are used in the agreement). If a participant retires before the end of a performance period, and the performance goals for such performance period are met, the participant will receive a pro rata portion of the performance units based on the number of months of employment completed during the performance period. If a participant terminates for any other reason, the award will be forfeited.
A copy of the form of performance unit agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K.

     THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made by and between Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and James T. Hackett (the "Executive"), as of December 11, 2006 (the "Effective Date").
     WHEREAS, the Executive is currently employed by the Company; and
     WHEREAS, the Executive and the Company have heretofore entered into that certain Employment Agreement dated as of February 5, 2004 (the "Original Agreement") and that certain Key Employee Change of Control Contract dated as of February 5, 2004 (the "Change of Control Contract"); and
     WHEREAS, the Company is desirous of continuing to employ the Executive in an executive capacity on the terms and conditions, and for the consideration, hereinafter set forth, and the Executive is desirous of continuing to be employed by the Company on such terms and conditions and for such consideration; and
     WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive desire to replace the Original Agreement and the Change of Control Contract with this Agreement;
     NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and obligations contained herein, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
     1.1 . Effective as of the Effective Date and continuing for the period of time set forth in Article 2 of this Agreement, the Executive's employment by the Company shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Employment; Effective Date
     1.2 . As of the Effective Date, the Executive is serving as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors"). The Company shall maintain the Executive in the position of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and/or in such other positions as the parties mutually may agree, for the full term of the Executive's employment hereunder. In addition, the Company shall nominate the Executive for re-election to the Board of Directors as and when his term expires while he remains employed under this Agreement.
Positions
     1.3 . The Executive agrees to serve in the position(s) referred to in paragraph 1.2 and to perform diligently and to the best of his abilities the duties and services appertaining to such offices, as well as such additional duties and services appropriate to such offices upon which the parties mutually may agree from time to time. The Executive's employment shall also be subject to the policies maintained and established by the Company, as the same may be amended from time to time.
Duties and Services
 
     1.4 . The Executive agrees, during the period of his employment by the Company, to devote his primary business time, energy and best efforts to the business and affairs of the Company and its affiliates and not to engage, directly or indirectly, in any other business or businesses, whether or not similar to that of the Company, except with the consent of the Board of Directors. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties recognize and agree that the Executive may engage in passive personal investments and other civic and charitable activities that do not conflict with the business and affairs of the Company or interfere with the Executive's performance of his duties hereunder without the necessity of obtaining the consent of the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company acknowledges that the Executive may continue to serve (i) as a member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Fluor Corporation, and Temple-Inland Inc. and (ii) as a member of the board of trustees of Baylor College of Medicine; provided, however, that Executive agrees that if the Board of Directors determines that continued service with one or more of these entities is inconsistent with the Executive's duties hereunder and gives written notice of such to the Executive, the Executive will resign from such position(s).
Other Interests
     1.5 . The Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Executive owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty, fidelity, and allegiance to use his reasonable best efforts to act at all times in the best interests of the Company. In keeping with these duties, the Executive shall make full disclosure to the Company of all business opportunities pertaining to the Company's business and shall not appropriate for the Executive's own benefit business opportunities concerning the subject matter of the fiduciary relationship.
Duty of Loyalty
     1.6 . The Executive shall generally be expected to maintain ownership of shares of the Company's common stock ("Shares") having a value equal to five times his annual base salary as in effect from time to time. Unvested shares of restricted stock will be credited towards this requirement. The Executive shall be required to obtain the prior approval of the Board of Directors before selling Shares, if the sale would reduce his ownership below this required level, except to the extent the sale is necessary in order to cover the exercise price for exercise of options to acquire Shares or taxes due on such exercise or on the vesting of restricted Shares or other awards based on Shares.
Stock Ownership Requirement
     2.1 . Unless sooner terminated pursuant to other provisions hereof, the Company agrees to employ the Executive for the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on December 3, 2009. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2.4, beginning with December 3, 2007 (the "Initial Extension Date"), said term of employment shall be extended automatically for an additional successive one-year period as of such date and as of each annual anniversary date of the Initial Extension Date that occurs while this Agreement is in effect; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the Initial Extension Date or any such annual anniversary date of the Initial Extension Date, either party shall give written notice to the other that no such automatic extension shall occur, then the Executive's employment shall terminate on the last day of the two-year period beginning on (i) the Initial Extension Date (if such notice is given prior to such date) or (ii) the annual anniversary date of the Initial Extension Date that
Term
 
next occurs after such notice is given (if such notice is given on or after the Initial Extension Date).
     2.2 . Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.1, the Company shall have the right to terminate the Executive's employment under this Agreement at any time before the expiration of the term provided for in paragraph 2.1, for any of the following reasons:
Company's Right to Terminate
     (i) upon the Executive's death;
     (ii) upon the Executive's becoming incapacitated by accident, sickness or other circumstance which renders him mentally or physically incapable of performing the duties and services required of him hereunder on a full-time basis with reasonable accommodation for a period of at least 120 consecutive days or for a period of 180 business days during any twelve-month period ("Disability");
     (iii) for "Cause," which for purposes of this Agreement shall mean (A) the Executive's gross negligence, gross neglect or willful misconduct in the performance of the duties required of him hereunder, (B) the Executive's commission of a felony that is expected to result in a material adverse effect on the Company, or (C) the Executive's material breach of any material provision of this Agreement; or
     (iv) for any other reason whatsoever or for no reason, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.
A termination of the Executive's employment by the Company pursuant to clause (iv) above is referred to as a "Without Cause Termination." The termination of the Executive's employment by the Company pursuant to subclause (A) or (C) of clause (iii) above shall not be deemed to be for Cause, and will be treated as a Without Cause Termination, unless the Company has first provided written notice to the Executive specifically identifying the conduct on which the termination is based, and the Executive has failed to cure such conduct within 10 business days after such notice is given. Any termination of the Executive's employment by the Company for Cause shall be effective only upon delivery to the Executive of a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors, adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors (excluding the Executive) following a meeting at which the Executive was given an opportunity to be heard on at least five business days' advance notice, finding that the Executive was guilty of the conduct constituting Cause, and specifying the particulars thereof.
     2.3 . Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2.1, the Executive shall have the right to terminate his employment under this Agreement at any time before the expiration of the term provided for in paragraph 2.1, for any of the following reasons:
Executive's Right to Terminate
     (i) upon a Change in Employment Terms (as defined in paragraph 8.1); provided, however, that a termination of employment by the Executive under this clause (i) must occur on or before the date that is 120 days after the date upon which the Executive receives notice of a Change in Employment Terms;
 
     (ii) for any reason whatsoever or for no reason, in the sole discretion of the Executive, during the 30-day period immediately following the first anniversary of the date upon which a Change of Control (as defined in paragraph 8.1) occurs (unless such Change of Control is attributable to the consummation by the Company of a Business Combination (as defined in paragraph 8.1) pursuant to which at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the corporation resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board (as defined in paragraph 8.1) at the time of execution of the initial agreement, or of the action of the Board of Directors, providing for such Business Combination); or
     (iii) for any other reason whatsoever or for no reason, in the sole discretion of the Executive.
A termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above is referred to as a "Good Reason Termination."
     2.4 . If the Company or the Executive desires to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder at any time prior to expiration of the term of employment as provided in paragraph 2.1, it or he shall do so by giving written notice to the other party that it or he has elected to terminate the Executive's employment hereunder and stating the effective date and reason for such termination, provided that no such action shall alter or amend any other provisions hereof or rights arising hereunder, including, without limitation, the provisions of Article 4. No further renewals of the term of employment under this Agreement shall occur pursuant to paragraph 2.1 after the giving of any such notice.
Notice of Termination
     2.5 . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, upon the termination of the Executive's employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested by the Board of Directors, he shall immediately resign from the Board of Directors and from all boards of directors of subsidiaries and affiliates of the Company of which he may be a member. The Executive hereby agrees to execute any and all documentation of such resignations upon request by the Company, but he shall be treated for all purposes as having so resigned upon termination of his employment, regardless of when or whether he executes any such documentation.
Resignations
     3.1 . During his employment hereunder, the Executive shall receive a minimum annual base salary of $1,400,000. The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") shall review the Executive's annual base salary on an annual basis and may, in its sole discretion, increase, but not decrease, the Executive's annual base salary, and references in this Agreement to "annual base salary" shall refer to annual base salary as so increased. The Executive's annual base salary shall be paid in equal installments in accordance with the Company's standard policy regarding payment of compensation to executives but no less frequently than monthly.
Base Salary
     3.2 . For the 2006 calendar year and subsequent calendar years ending during his employment hereunder, the Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual
Annual Bonuses
 
cash bonus under the Company's Annual Incentive Bonus Plan or a successor plan (the "Bonus Plan"), in an amount determined by the Compensation Committee, based on performance goals established by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the terms of the Bonus Plan, and with a target (the "Incentive Target") of not less than 130% (the "Incentive Target Percentage") of the Executive's annual base salary as in effect at the beginning of the calendar year, but subject to a maximum annual cash bonus of 200% of the Incentive Target (that is, 260% of the annual base salary) for the year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the minimum annual bonus described in the preceding sentence that the Executive shall receive for the calendar year in which a Change of Control occurs and the two subsequent calendar years during his employment hereunder (each of which shall be paid no later than the last day of the first month ending after the applicable calendar year) shall equal the product of (i) the Incentive Target Percentage established by the Board of Directors prior to the Change of Control for the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs multiplied by (ii) the Executive's annual base salary in effect at the beginning of the applicable calendar year; provided, however, that if the Executive's Incentive Target Percentage for the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs has not been established by the Board of Directors prior to the date of the Change of Control, then his Incentive Target Percentage described in clause (i) above shall be deemed to equal his Incentive Target Percentage that applied to the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the Change of Control occurs.
     3.3 . During his employment hereunder, the Executive shall be eligible for equity awards in accordance with normal competitive pay practices, on a basis no less favorable than the process and approach used for the Company's other senior executives, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Equity Awards after the Effective Date
     3.4 . If the Executive remains employed by the Company at least until December 3, 2008, the Executive shall be entitled to a special pension benefit from the Company, such that his aggregate benefits under the Company's Retirement Plan and the RRP (as defined in paragraph 8.1) and any successors thereto (collectively, the "Pension Plans"), plus the special pension benefit under this paragraph 3.4, are equal to the aggregate benefits to which he would have been entitled under the Pension Plans, if his years of service with the Company (but not his age) were increased by five plus the number of his actual years of service with the Company in excess of five (if any). The special pension benefit payable under this paragraph 3.4 shall be paid at the same time or times as the Executive's benefit under the RRP.
Special Pension Service Crediting
     3.5 . During his employment hereunder, the Executive shall be afforded the following benefits as incidences of his employment:
Other Benefits
     (i) .

The Executive shall be eligible for participation in all employee and executive benefits, including without limitation qualified and supplemental retirement, savings and deferred compensation plans, medical and life insurance plans, and other fringe benefits, as in effect from time to time for the Company's most senior executives; provided, however, that the Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall not be a participant in, and he hereby waives any right to participate in, the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Officer Severance Plan (as the same may be amended from time to time).
Employee and Executive Benefits Generally
     4.1 . The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company or any of its affiliates, and their respective businesses, which shall have been obtained by the Executive during the Executive's employment by the Company or any of its affiliates and which shall not be or become public knowledge (other than by acts by the Executive or representatives of the Executive in violation of this Agreement) (referred to herein as "Confidential Information"). Following the termination of the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process, communicate or divulge any such Confidential Information to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this paragraph 4.1 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement. Also, within 14 days after the termination of Executive's employment for any reason, the Executive shall return to Company all documents and other tangible items containing Company information which are in the Executive's possession, custody or control.
Confidential Information
     4.2 . The Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article by the Executive, and the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Article, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including the recovery of damages from the Executive and his agents involved in such breach and remedies available to the Company pursuant to this and other agreements with the Executive.
Remedies
     5.1 . The Company has and will disclose to the Executive, or place the Executive in a position to have access to or develop, trade secrets and Confidential Information of the Company or its affiliates; and/or has and will place the Executive in a position to develop
In General
 
business good will on behalf of the Company or its affiliates; and/or has and will entrust the Executive with business opportunities of the Company or its affiliates. As part of the consideration for the compensation and benefits to be paid to the Executive hereunder; to protect the trade secrets and Confidential Information of the Company and its affiliates that have been and will in the future be disclosed or entrusted to the Executive, the business good will of the Company and its affiliates that has been and will in the future be developed in the Executive, or the business opportunities that have been and will in the future be disclosed or entrusted to the Executive by the Company and its affiliates; and as an additional incentive for the Company to enter into this Agreement, the Company and the Executive agree to the noncompetition and the nonsolicitation obligations hereunder.
     5.2 . The Executive shall not, directly or indirectly for the Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where the Company or any of its affiliates are conducting any business or have during the previous 12 months conducted such business:
Noncompetition
     (i) engage in any business competitive with the oil and gas exploration and production business activity conducted by the Company and its affiliates (the "Business"); or
     (ii) render advice or services to, or otherwise assist, any other person, association, or entity who is engaged, directly or indirectly, in any business competitive with the Business.
For these purposes, if less than 33% of the revenues of any business are derived from activities competitive with the Business, then the first business shall not be considered to be competitive with the Business. These noncompetition obligations shall apply (x) during the period that the Executive is employed by the Company and (y) if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated unilaterally by the Executive (other than pursuant to a Good Reason Termination) on or before December 3, 2010, then, except as provided in the next sentence, during the one-year period following such termination. If the Executive becomes entitled to the Change of Control Benefits (as defined in paragraph 7.4) pursuant to paragraphs 7.1 or 7.4, or if the Executive's employment with the Company is terminated for any reason after December 3, 2010, then, in either such case, these noncompetition obligations shall immediately cease to apply.
     5.3 . The Executive shall not, directly or indirectly for the Executive or for others, in any geographic area or market where the Company or any of its affiliates are conducting any business or have during the previous 12 months conducted such business, induce any employee of the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company or such affiliates, or hire or assist in the hiring of any such employee by any person, association, or entity not affiliated with the Company, unless such employee has terminated employment with the Company and its affiliates before such solicitation. These nonsolicitation obligations shall apply during the period that the Executive is employed by the Company and during the one-year period commencing on the date of the Executive's termination of employment for any reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph 5.3 shall not restrict the ability of the Company to take actions with respect to the employment or the
Nonsolicitation
 
termination of employment of any of its employees, or for the Executive to participate in any such actions in his capacity as an officer of the Company.
     5.4 . The Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of this Article by the Executive, and the Company shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Article, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Executive and the Executive's agents involved in such breach and remedies available to the Company pursuant to this and other agreements with the Executive.
Enforcement and Remedies
     5.5 . It is expressly understood and agreed that the Company and the Executive consider the restrictions contained in this Article to be reasonable and necessary to protect the proprietary information of the Company. Nevertheless, if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by such court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by the court, to be fully enforced.
Reformation
     6.1 . The Executive and the Company and its affiliates shall refrain from any criticisms or disparaging comments about each other or in any way relating to the Executive's employment or separation from employment; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall apply to or restrict in any way the communication of information by the Company or any of its affiliates or the Executive to any state or federal law enforcement agency or require notice to the Company or the Executive thereof, and none of the Executive, the Company or any of its affiliates will be in breach of the covenant contained above solely by reason of testimony or disclosure which is compelled by applicable law or regulation or process of law. A violation or threatened violation of this prohibition may be enjoined by the courts. The rights afforded under this provision are in addition to any and all rights and remedies otherwise afforded by law.
In General
     7.1 . If the Executive's employment hereunder shall terminate (i) upon the Executive's death, (ii) upon the Executive's Disability, (iii) upon expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1 because either party has provided the notice contemplated in such paragraph, or (iv) by the Company for Cause, then, in any such case, all compensation and all benefits to the Executive hereunder shall terminate contemporaneously with termination of his employment except to the extent this Agreement or any plan or arrangement of the Company provides for vested benefits or continuation of benefits beyond termination of employment; provided, however, that:

     (B) if such termination occurs during a Change of Control Period by reason of the expiration of the term provided in paragraph 2.1 because the Company has provided the notice contemplated in such paragraph, then, subject to the provisions of paragraph 8.2, the Company shall also provide the Executive with the Change of Control Benefits.

have been granted to the Executive that have not yet vested shall vest in full at the target level upon the Executive's termination of employment; (5) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide the Executive with (I) financial planning services until the third anniversary of the date of the termination of his employment on the same basis as was provided immediately prior to such date, and (II) outplacement services at a cost to the Company not to exceed $30,000, the scope and provider of which shall be selected by the Executive in the Executive's sole discretion; and (6) the Company shall provide the Executive with Continuation Coverage (as defined in paragraph 8.1).
     7.5 . As a condition to the receipt of the Termination Benefits, the Executive must first execute a release agreement (the "Release") substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (with such changes to such form as the Company may reasonably require to reflect the circumstances relating to the termination of the Executive's employment and/or changes in applicable law). The Company shall also execute the Release; provided, however, that the Company may, in its sole discretion, waive the requirement that the Release be executed by the Executive and the Company as a condition to the Executive's receipt of the Termination Benefits. Notwithstanding any provision in paragraphs 7.2 or 7.3 to the contrary, unless the Company has waived the requirement for the Executive and the Company to execute the Release as provided in the preceding sentence, no Termination Benefits shall be payable or provided by the Company unless and until the Release has been executed by the Executive, has not been revoked, and is no longer subject to revocation by the Executive.
Release
     7.6 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that any payment, benefit or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest or penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), the Company shall pay to the Executive an additional payment (a "Gross-up Payment") in an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax imposed on any Gross-up Payment, the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments. The Company and the Executive shall make an initial determination as to whether a Gross-up Payment is required and the amount of any such Gross-up Payment. The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service which, if successful, would require the Company to make a Gross-up Payment (or a Gross-up Payment in excess of that, if any, initially determined by the Company and the Executive) within 10 business days of the receipt of such claim. The Company shall notify the Executive in writing at least 10 business days prior to the due date of any response required with respect to such claim if it plans to contest the claim. If the Company decides to contest such claim, then the Executive shall cooperate fully with the Company in such action; provided, however, the Company shall bear and pay directly or indirectly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such action and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of the Company's action. If, as a result of the Company's action with respect to a claim, the Executive receives a refund of any amount paid by the Company with
Parachute Payments
 
respect to such claim, then the Executive shall promptly pay such refund to the Company. If the Company fails to timely notify the Executive whether it will contest such claim or the Company determines not to contest such claim, then the Company shall immediately pay to the Executive the portion of such claim, if any, which it has not previously paid to the Executive.
     7.7 . The Executive shall have no duty to find new employment following the termination of his employment under circumstances which require the Company to provide the Termination Benefits or Change of Control Benefits to the Executive pursuant to this Article 7. Any salary or remuneration received by the Executive from a third party for the providing of personal services (whether by employment or by functioning as an independent contractor) following the termination of his employment shall not reduce the Company's obligation (if any) to provide the Termination Benefits or Change of Control Benefits (or the amount of such benefits) pursuant to the terms of this Article 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, if, and to the extent that, following the termination of his employment under circumstances pursuant to which this Article 7 apply, the Executive becomes entitled to receive benefits from a third party that are comparable to (i) the Termination Benefits set forth in paragraph 7.2(E), then the Company's obligation to provide such Termination Benefits to the Executive shall cease, and (ii) one or more benefits provided under the Executive's Continuation Coverage, then such coverage with respect to such benefit(s) shall become secondary.
No Duty to Mitigate Losses
     7.8 . In light of the difficulties in estimating the damages for an early termination of this Agreement, the Company and the Executive hereby agree that the Termination Benefits or Change of Control Benefits, if any, to be received by the Executive pursuant to this Article 7 shall be received by the Executive as liquidated damages.
Liquidated Damages
     7.9 . This Agreement governs the rights and obligations of the Executive and the Company with respect to the Executive's base salary and certain perquisites of employment. Except as expressly provided herein, the Executive's rights and obligations both during the term of his employment and thereafter with respect to stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, incentive and deferred compensation, life insurance policies insuring the life of the Executive, and other benefits under the plans and programs maintained by the Company shall be governed by the separate agreements, plans and other documents and instruments governing such matters. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, the Executive acknowledges that he has no right to grants of stock options, restricted stock or performance shares either under the stock plans maintained by the Company or otherwise other than (i) grants made prior to the Effective Date, (ii) as provided in paragraph 3.3 or (iii) in the discretion of the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that (A) the Original Agreement and the Change of Control Contract provided the Executive with certain rights upon his termination of employment under certain circumstances with respect to stock options and restricted stock awards granted to the Executive under the Company's plans and programs and (B) such rights have inadvertently not been included in all documents evidencing the stock options and restricted stock awards that have been granted to the Executive by the Company prior to the Effective Date and it is possible that such rights will inadvertently not be included in all documents evidencing the stock options and restricted stock awards that will be granted to the Executive by the Company on or after the Effective Date. Those rights have been preserved in the provisions of this Agreement relating to
Incentive and Deferred Compensation
 
the Executive's right to receive Termination Benefits and Change of Control Benefits under certain circumstances. Accordingly, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in a document evidencing a stock option or restricted stock award granted to the Executive under the Company's plans and programs (whether before or after the Effective Date), the rights that the Executive has with respect to such stock options and restricted stock awards as part of his Termination Benefits and Change of Control Benefits hereunder shall govern and control unless specifically provided otherwise in an applicable grant document that specifically references the inapplicability of the rights that the Executive has hereunder with respect to the stock option or restricted stock award subject to such grant document.

     (ii) an amount equal to the additional Company matching contributions which would have been made on the Executive's behalf in the Company's Employee Savings Plan (the "ESP") (assuming continued participation on the same basis as immediately prior to the Measurement Date), plus the additional amount of any benefit the Executive would have accrued under the SRP as a result of contribution limitations in the ESP, until the earliest to occur of (A) the expiration of the three-year period following the date of the Executive's termination of employment and (B) the first day of the month next following the Executive's 65 birthday (with the Company's matching contributions being determined pursuant to the applicable provisions of the ESP and the SRP and based upon the Executive's compensation (including any amounts deferred pursuant to any deferred compensation program) in effect for the 12-month period immediately prior to the Measurement Date); and
th
     (iii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values, as of the date of the Executive's termination of employment, of (A) the accrued retirement benefit payable under the RRP and (B) the additional retirement benefits that the Executive would have accrued under the Company's Retirement Plan and the RRP (taking into account the special pension service crediting provided for in paragraph 3.4) if the Executive had continued employment until the earliest to occur of (x) the expiration of the three-year period following the date of the Executive's termination of employment and (y) the first day of the month next
 
following the Executive's 65 birthday (assuming that the Executive's compensation in each of the additional years is that required by paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2), with the present values being computed by discounting to the date of the Executive's termination of employment the accrued benefit and the additional retirement benefits payable as lump sums at an assumed benefit commencement date of the later of (I) the date the Executive attains age 55 and (II) the date three years after the date of the Executive's termination of employment (but in no event later than the first day of the month next following the Executive's 65 birthday), at the rate of interest used for valuing lump-sum payments in excess of $25,000 for participants with retirement benefits commencing immediately under the Company's Retirement Plan, as in effect as of the Measurement Date.

     (i) with respect to a termination of Executive's employment that does not occur during a Change of Control Period and which is not a Termination in Anticipation of a Change of Control: (A) the Company's assignment to the Executive of any duties inconsistent in any material respect with the positions of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, or any other action by the Company that results in a material diminution of the Executive's position, duties, or authority; (B) the Company's failure to reappoint the Executive to the positions of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer or to nominate him for re-election to the Board of Directors as required by paragraph 1.2; (C) the Company's material breach of any other material provision of this Agreement; (D) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office outside The Woodlands, Texas and Houston, Texas metropolitan areas; or (E) the Company's giving a notice of nonrenewal of the term of employment pursuant to paragraph 2.1 before the Executive's attainment of age 55; provided, however, that, prior to the Executive's termination of employment under any of subclauses (A) through (D) of this clause (i), the Executive must give written notice to the Company of any such breach, assignment, action, relocation or failure and such breach, assignment, action, relocation or failure must remain uncorrected for 10 business days following such written notice; or

1.2; (C) the Company's material breach of any other material provision of this Agreement; (D) the Company's requiring the Executive to be based at any office outside The Woodlands, Texas and Houston, Texas metropolitan areas or the Company's requiring the Executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the date upon which a Change of Control occurs; (E) a failure to provide for the Executive's participation in bonus, stock option, restricted stock, incentive award, and other compensation plans which provide opportunities to receive compensation which are the greater of (x) the opportunities provided by the Company to other executives in the Executive's peer group (determined based on title, responsibilities, and duties) or (y) the opportunities under any such plans under which the Executive was participating immediately prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs; (F) a failure to provide for the employee benefits (including, but not limited to, pension, retirement, savings, medical, dental, life insurance and disability plans) and perquisites (including, but not limited to, expense reimbursement, office and support staff, tax and financial planning services, use of an automobile and payment of related expenses, payment of club dues, other fringe benefits and vacation benefits) applicable to the Executive from the greater of (x) the employee benefits and perquisites provided by the Company to other executives in the Executive's peer group (determined based on title, responsibilities, and duties) or (y) the employee benefits and perquisites to which the Executive was participating in or receiving immediately prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs; (G) the Company's giving a notice of nonrenewal of the term of employment pursuant to paragraph 2.1 before the Executive's attainment of age 55; (H) any purported termination by the Company of Executive's employment hereunder otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or (I) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy the requirements of the second sentence of paragraph 8.13; provided, however, that, prior to the Executive's termination of employment under any of subclauses (A) through (F) of this clause (ii), the Executive must give written notice to the Company of any such breach, assignment, action, relocation, failure or diminution and such breach, assignment, action, relocation, failure or diminution must remain uncorrected for 10 business days following such written notice. For purposes of determining whether a "Change in Employment Terms" under subclauses (D), (E) or (F) of this clause (ii) has occurred in connection with a Termination in Anticipation of a Change of Control, the provisions of such subclauses shall be interpreted by considering the Executive's travel requirements, participation in compensation and benefit plans, and perquisites immediately prior to any change therein, rather than immediately prior to the date on which a Change of Control occurs. For purposes of this clause (ii), any good faith determination of a "Change in Employment Terms" made by the Executive shall be conclusive.
     "Change of Control" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the SIP as in effect on the Effective Date.
     "Change of Control Period" means the three-year period beginning on the date a Change of Control occurs.
 
     "Continuation Coverage" means, until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the date of the Executive's termination of employment and (ii) the first day of the month next following the Executive's 65 birthday, the Company shall maintain in full force and effect for the Executive all life, accident, disability, medical and health care benefit plans and programs or arrangements in which the Executive was entitled to participate, at the same levels and rates, in which the Executive was participating immediately prior to the Measurement Date, provided that the Executive's continued participation is possible under the general terms and provisions of such plans and programs, provided, however, that if the Executive becomes reemployed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility. In the event that the Executive's participation in any such plan or program is barred due to the eligibility and participation requirements of such plan or program as then in effect, the Company shall arrange to provide benefits substantially similar to those to which the Executive was entitled to receive under such plans and programs of the Company prior to the Measurement Date. In such event, appropriate adjustments shall be made so that the after-tax value thereof to the Executive is similar to the after-tax value of the benefit plans in which participation is barred. Benefits provided pursuant to this paragraph are contractual only and are not to be considered a continuation of coverage as provided under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code. For purposes of determining the Executive's eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans and programs, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until three years after the date of the Executive's termination of employment and to have retired on the last day of such period, and, if the Executive satisfies the eligibility requirements, such benefits shall commence no later than the expiration of the three-year continuation period provided in clause (i) of this paragraph.

     "RRP" means the Company's Retirement Restoration Plan.
 
     "Severance Payment" means an amount equal to three times the sum of (i) the Executive's annual base salary pursuant to paragraph 3.1 in effect immediately prior to Executive's termination of employment hereunder and (ii) an amount equal to the product of the Incentive Target Percentage pursuant to paragraph 3.2 in effect for the calendar year in which such termination of employment occurs multiplied by the amount described in the foregoing clause (i).
     "SIP" means the Company's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan.
     "SRP" means the Company's Savings Restoration Plan.
     "Termination in Anticipation of a Change of Control" means that a Change of Control occurs and, prior to the date on which such Change of Control occurs, a Without Cause Termination or a Good Reason Termination occurs and it is reasonably demonstrated by the Executive that such termination of employment (i) was at the request of a third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or anticipation of a Change of Control.
     8.2 . Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the payment of any compensation or benefit hereunder (including, without limitation, any severance benefit) would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Section 409A of the Code because the timing of such payment is not delayed as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then any such payment or benefit that the Executive would otherwise be entitled to during the first six months following the date of the Executive's termination of employment shall be accumulated and paid or provided, as applicable, on the date that is six months after the date of the Executive's termination of employment (or if such date does not fall on a business day of the Company, the next following business day of the Company), or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid or provided under Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes and interest.

The Company agrees to pay as incurred, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability or entitlement under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof (whether such contest is between the Company and the Executive or between either of them and any third party, and including as a result of any contest by the Executive about the amount of any payment pursuant to this Agreement), plus in each case interest on any delayed payment at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2)(A) of the Code. The Company's obligations under this paragraph shall apply without regard to the outcome of any such contest; provided, however, that if such contest relates to a payment, act or omission that occurred prior to a Change of Control, then the Company's obligations under this paragraph shall apply only if the Executive obtains any money judgment or otherwise prevails with respect to any such contest.

Exhibit 10.2
     THIS PERFORMANCE UNIT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated ___, 200_, is by and between Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") and ("Employee").

Pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and subject further to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and Employee enter into this Agreement pursuant to which Employee may earn up to Performance Units. Each Performance Unit represents the value of one share of the $0.10 par value common stock of the Company ("Performance Units"). Upon the Company's achievement of pre-determined objectives for a specified performance period, the Company will pay out to Employee some or all of the Performance Units as hereinafter described.

     2.3.1 . The number of Performance Units to be earned by Employee for the Performance Period with respect to the First Performance Objective will be determined at the end of the Performance Period by comparing the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR") over the Performance Period to the TSRs of the Peer Companies' for the same Performance Period. For purposes of such comparison, TSR will be calculated as follows:
First Performance Objective
 
     "Stock Price" is defined as the average of the high and low prices for one share of the Company's common stock in one trading day and shall be adjusted for stock splits, spin-offs, mergers or any other corporate securities transaction affecting Stock Price, as determined by the Committee.
     "Business Days" are defined as any days the New York Stock Exchange is open and shares of stock are actively traded.
      . For the Performance Period, the following companies are the peer companies ("Peer Companies") to be used in the award determination with respect to the First Performance Objective. Any Peer Company that ceases to be a publicly traded entity on a recognized stock exchange during the Performance Period will be removed from the Peer Company list and will be replaced with one of the following "Alternate Peer Companies": Chevron Corporation, Chesapeake Energy Corporation, and XTO Energy Inc. When an Alternate Peer Company is added to the Peer Company list pursuant to this paragraph, such company will be added to the Peer Company list in the order set forth above. The Committee may evaluate for inclusion or exclusion any Peer Company that merges with or is acquired by another Peer Company during the Performance Period. No company, other than an Alternate Peer Company, may be added to the list during the Performance Period.
