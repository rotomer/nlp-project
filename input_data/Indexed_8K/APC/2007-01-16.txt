On January 10, 2007, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") approved special equity awards for certain executive officers to recognize such officers' leadership and contributions related to the Company's successful acquisition of Kerr-McGee Corporation and Western Gas Resources, Inc., the Company's new accounting and information technology systems integration, and to incentivize future performance related to these accomplishments. These grants were made to the following named executive officers in the form and amounts set forth below:
In connection with the above, three other executive officers also received stock option awards for an aggregate of 57,400 shares. Based on the Committee's desire to provide an additional retention incentive for Mr. Daniels, the Committee granted Mr. Daniels a restricted stock award in lieu of stock options. The stock options have a seven-year term, will vest in three equal installments on the anniversary date of the grant, and have a strike price of $40.51, the closing stock price on the date of grant as reported by The New York Stock Exchange. The restricted stock award will vest in three equal installments on the anniversary date of the grant.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized officer.
