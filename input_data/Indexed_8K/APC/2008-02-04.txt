Anadarko Announces 2007 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Results
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced fourth-quarter and full-year 2007 financial and operating results.
In 2007, we transformed Anadarkos portfolio and positioned the company for consistent and predictable performance in 2008 and beyond, said Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO Jim Hackett. Throughout the year, our retained properties demonstrated the strong and efficient performance we expected and delivered solid production volume growth. As a result, we were able to increase production guidance on three separate occasions in 2007, by a total of about 6% from the original projection, while improving the companys cost structure.
I am excited about the portfolio we have assembled and proud of the numerous accomplishments of our employees during the past year. Examples of these accomplishments include: the Independence Hub project, which was delivered on time and on budget, and ramped up production as projected; the substantial discoveries offshore Ghana and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and the completion of significant infrastructure enhancements in the Rocky Mountain region, added Hackett.
FOURTH-QUARTER 2007 RESULTS
Fourth-quarter net income available to common stockholders was $264 million, or $.56 per share (diluted), on revenues of $3.06 billion. Income from continuing operations was $276 million, or $.59 per share (diluted). On an after-tax basis, these results include:
Gains on asset divestitures of $230 million, or $.49 per share
State income tax expense attributable to divestitures, net of federal tax benefit, of approximately $51 million, or $.11 per share
Net unrealized losses on commodity derivatives of $322 million, or $.69 per share
Net realized gains on commodity derivatives of $40 million, or $.09 per share
Cash flow from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $943 million and discretionary cash flow from continuing operations totaled $1.59 billion.
(1)
In the 2006 fourth quarter, net income available to common stockholders was $1.92 billion, or $4.16 per share (diluted), which included a gain on the divestiture of the companys Canadian subsidiary in discontinued operations. Results from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 were a loss of $32 million, or $.08 per share (diluted).
Fourth-quarter 2007 sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids totaled 53 million BOE, or 576,000 BOE per day, a 13% increase over third-quarter 2007 volumes. Fourth-quarter 2007 natural gas sales volumes averaged 2.01 billion cubic feet per day, at an average price of $5.46 per thousand cubic feet. Oil sales volumes in the fourth quarter averaged 203,000 barrels per day, at an average price of $66.58 per barrel. Natural gas liquids sales volumes averaged 37,000 barrels per day, at an average price of $61.65 per barrel.
FULL-YEAR 2007 RESULTS
Anadarko reported full-year 2007 net income available to common stockholders of $3.78 billion, or $8.08 per share (diluted), on revenues of $15.89 billion. Income from continuing operations totaled $3.77 billion, or $8.05 per share (diluted). Net income available to common stockholders in 2006 was $4.75 billion, or $10.24 per share diluted, on revenues of $10.23 billion, while income from continuing operations totaled $2.47 billion, or $5.33 per share (diluted).

(1)
Sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids from continuing operations for 2007 totaled 211 million BOE.
PROVED RESERVES
Anadarko estimates its worldwide proved reserves at year-end 2007 totaled 2.43 billion BOE. In 2007, excluding the effect of divestitures, the company added approximately 250 million BOE of proved reserves and incurred costs in exploration and development activities of approximately $3.84 billion. Reserve additions were primarily driven by low-risk development activities and infill drilling in the Greater Natural Buttes area, Wattenberg field and Powder River Basin, as well as the previously announced Peregrino development offshore Brazil.
Anadarkos year-end 2007 proved reserves were balanced between natural gas (58%, or 8.50 trillion cubic feet) and liquids (42%, or 1.01 billion barrels), which include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.

FINANCIAL DATA
Eleven pages of summary financial data follow, including current hedge positions, financial guidance and supplemental production guidance for the retained-asset portfolio. Amounts are preliminary and unaudited. All prior-year information has been re-cast to reflect the successful efforts method of accounting. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2007, management determined that a revision to previously reported gains on asset divestitures was necessary, primarily to correct the cost basis of divested assets. Management concluded that the adjustment was not material to reported results for the prior periods, but has corrected its financial records. Accordingly, previously reported net income available to common stockholders for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2007, has been reduced by $112 million ($0.23 per diluted share) to $3,514 million ($7.52 per diluted share).
Anadarko Petroleum Corporations mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by exploring for, acquiring and developing oil and natural gas resources vital to the worlds health and welfare. For more information about Anadarko, please visit www.anadarko.com.

Exhibit 99.2
Anadarko Announces Capital Program and Outlook for 2008
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:APC) today announced the details of its 2008 capital budget and provided production estimates for 2008. Anadarkos Board of Directors has approved total capital expenditures, including expensed exploration, of $4.5 to $4.7 billion. The capital program includes approximately 20% for exploration activities.
Anadarkos 2008 capital program is geared toward accelerating the value of the more than 7 billion BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) in net risked captured resources in our asset base, said Jim Hackett, Anadarko President, Chairman and CEO. Exploration remains a key component of the program, which also leverages our industry-leading deepwater rig position, hub-and-spoke infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and extensive midstream position onshore. Through a combination of our product hedging strategy, basis swaps and firm transportation commitments, weve reduced risk and ensured that we will have adequate cash flow to fund our capital program while continuing to reduce leverage. A focus on capital efficiency, reduced costs and reserve growth will continue to drive our investment decisions and portfolio management.
The company also increased its guidance for expected 2008 oil and natural gas production to the range of 205 to 210 million barrels of oil equivalent, as detailed in the guidance schedule attached to Anadarkos fourth-quarter and year-end 2007 earnings release.
CAPITAL ALLOCATION BY AREA
Anadarkos capital budget for 2008 reflects the companys commitment to accelerate the value of its net risked captured resources with a particular emphasis on achieving double-digit production growth in the Rocky Mountain region, continuing development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, including the start-up of the Blind Faith platform, driving toward first production at the Peregrino field offshore Brazil and extending the companys deepwater exploration activities worldwide. An approximate breakout of the companys 2008 capital budget by area is provided below:
30% Rocky Mountains
20% Southern U.S.
25% Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
15% International and Frontier
10% Midstream
U.S. Onshore
The majority of the 2008 budget will focus on Anadarkos inventory of development opportunities in the resource plays of the Rocky Mountain and Southern regions. Approximately 2,700 to 3,000 U.S. onshore development wells are planned in 2008, comprised of approximately 85% in the Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, Powder River Basin and other areas in the Rocky Mountains, and approximately 15% in the companys Southern region including the Delaware Basin, eastern Chalk and Carthage areas of Texas.
Anadarko has identified thousands of low-risk opportunities onshore in the U.S., including infill drilling, re-completions and other repeatable projects capable of delivering double-digit production growth in the Rocky Mountain region for years to come. During 2007, the company also expanded its midstream infrastructure in the Rockies to enhance its ability to execute upon its development and production activities. Two major projects scheduled to commence in 2008 will further expand processing and gathering capabilities in the area. The first involves the second-phase expansion of the Chapita plant in Greater Natural Buttes, which will add a cryogenic processing facility that will double Chapitas current processing capacity to 500 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d). The other significant project will add 400 MMcf/d of gathering capacity at the Fort Union system, bringing its total capacity to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and making it the largest capacity gathering system in the Powder River Basin.
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
The companys 2008 capital for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is primarily focused on development drilling, with a particular focus on the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the K2 unit. In 2008, Anadarko also anticipates drilling approximately six to eight exploration and appraisal wells targeting Miocene and Lower Tertiary objectives.
International/Frontier
Anadarko has allocated the majority of its international capital toward advancing projects in Brazil, Alaska, Algeria and China. Anadarko also expects to increase its international exploration and appraisal activities in 2008  the majority of which will be focused on deepwater opportunities in West Africa, Brazil and in the South China Sea.
We are confident that our 2008 capital program will again deliver solid performance, said Anadarko Chief Operating Officer Karl Kurz. Our operations in the Rocky Mountains continue to drive predictable production growth and reserve replacement. In 2008, we will also benefit from a full years production at Independence Hub, and we have significant development projects ongoing at the Peregrino field offshore Brazil and the Blind Faith field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Blind Faith is scheduled to come on line this year. In addition, we are well positioned to transfer our skill sets and expertise from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to other deepwater areas offshore Brazil, West Africa and the South China Sea.
