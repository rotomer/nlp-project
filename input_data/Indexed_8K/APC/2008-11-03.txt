OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Increased reported sales volumes 9 percent over third-quarter 2007 from retained properties
Achieved production milestone of 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day
Set new daily production records in the Greater Natural Buttes and Powder River Basin
As illustrated by the highlights above, our third-quarter performance was very strong, Anadarko Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett said. At one point during the quarter, we achieved a daily record for sales volumes of 600,000 BOE. Following major back-to-back hurricanes, our employees and contractors throughout our operating regions performed in an extraordinary fashion to safely overcome the impacts of the storms  enabling us to achieve a 9-percent increase in overall reported sales volumes over third-quarter 2007 and, for the seventh consecutive quarter, meet or exceed our volume guidance.
At Independence Hub, the companys largest producing platform in the Gulf of Mexico, production was restored within three days of Hurricane Ike. Anadarko also demonstrated notable growth in the Rockies with new daily production records in both the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, where sales volumes increased nearly 40 percent for the quarter compared to the previous year, and the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, where sales volumes for the quarter were up about 55 percent year-over-year.
Third-quarter 2008 sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids totaled 51 million BOE, or 552,000 BOE per day. Third-quarter 2008 natural gas sales volumes averaged 1.994 billion cubic feet per day. Oil sales volumes in the third quarter averaged 182,000 barrels per day, and natural gas liquids sales volumes averaged 38,000 barrels per day.
EXPLORATION HIGHLIGHTS
Announced substantial pre-salt discovery offshore Brazil at the Wahoo prospect
Encountered more than 700 feet of net pay in Tonga West appraisal well in Gulf of Mexico
Continued U.S. onshore exploration program with encouraging results
Anadarko continues to build upon its successful international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration and appraisal programs. During the third quarter, the company announced a substantial pre-salt discovery at the deepwater Wahoo prospect on block BM-C-30 in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. Extensive logging, fluid and pressure sampling has now confirmed more than 200 feet of net pay consisting of high-quality, high-gravity crude oil in an upper zone, with additional hydrocarbon-bearing zones encountered deeper in the well. Casing is currently being run to total depth to prepare for drillstem testing in 2009 to further evaluate the multiple hydrocarbon-bearing zones. The partnership also is planning further exploration and appraisal drilling on the block in 2009. Anadarko, through a wholly owned subsidiary, operates the block with a 30-percent working interest.
Since announcing the Wahoo pre-salt discovery in September, we have successfully reached total depth of approximately 20,000 feet, encountered an additional oil accumulation in the deeper objective and confirmed the quality of the previously announced reservoir, Anadarko Sr. Vice President, Worldwide Exploration, Bob Daniels said. We are very encouraged by this discovery and its similarities to the giant Jubarte field, and we look forward to working with the Brazilian government and our partners to further delineate the areas potential.
Anadarko plans to now move the Transocean drillship to the Esprito Santo Basin to continue its pre-salt exploration program, which includes re-entering the Serpa prospect and drilling at least five additional pre-salt tests.
Deepwater Millennium
Anadarko and its partners also continue an active program offshore Ghana, where the partnership recently spud the Hyedua-2 appraisal well on the Deepwater Tano license. Prior to year end, the partnership also plans to spud the nearby Tweneboa prospect, which has similar size and seismic characteristics to the giant Jubilee field. The partners expect Jubilee to be sanctioned prior to year end.
In the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko recently completed a successful appraisal well, located 3,000 feet to the south and up dip from the original Tonga West discovery well. The appraisal well encountered more than 700 feet of net pay in dipping formations. Anadarko is the operator with a 33.75-percent working interest.
The Tonga West confirmation well encountered subsalt Miocene sands with much greater quality and thickness than we had anticipated, Anadarko Sr. Vice President, Worldwide Operations, Chuck Meloy said. This well is a tremendous success that affirms this world-class reservoir and solidifies our previous estimated resource range of 200 million to 400 million BOE. Anadarko expects to sanction the Caesar/Tonga complex this year, with first significant volumes as early as 2011.
Anadarkos U.S. onshore exploration programs in the Maverick Basin, and Haynesville and Marcellus Shale plays are ongoing with encouraging results. Additional details regarding Anadarkos U.S. onshore exploration programs and other activities are available in the third-quarter 2008 Operations Report at .

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Completed $600 million worth of share repurchases
Retired approximately $350 million of debt
Held strong liquidity position with a cash balance of nearly $2 billion at quarter end
We believe we have a strong capital structure and liquidity position, Hackett said. We closed the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $2 billion, after completing the repurchase of $600 million worth of shares and retiring approximately $350 million of debt. Our $1.3 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and we anticipate closing the divestiture of Peregrino during the fourth quarter, with net cash proceeds in excess of $1 billion. We expect to deliver upon our commitment to achieve our debt-to-cap target of between 25 percent to 35 percent by year end.
