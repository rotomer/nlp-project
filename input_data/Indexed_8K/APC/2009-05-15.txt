4. . The Company covenants with each of you, and with each Underwriter participating in the offering of Shares, as follows with respect to such offering of Shares:
Certain Covenants of the Company
(a) As soon as practicable, following the execution of this Agreement, the Company will prepare the Prospectus setting forth the number of Shares covered thereby, the names of the Underwriters participating in the offering and the number of Shares which each severally has agreed to purchase, the names of the Underwriters acting as co-managers in connection with the offering, the price at which the Shares are to be purchased by the Underwriters from the Company, the public offering price of the Shares, if applicable, the selling concession and reallowance applicable to the Shares, if any, any Additional Shares information and such other information as you and the Company deem appropriate in connection with the offering of the Shares. The Company will transmit copies of the Prospectus to the Commission in compliance with Rule 424 under the Act and will furnish to the Underwriters named therein as many copies of the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package as you shall reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Act.
(b) If at any time when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Act) is required by the Act to be delivered in connection with sales of such Shares any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to further amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser or if it shall be necessary at any time to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of the Act, the Company will, as soon as practicable, prepare and file (if required) with the Commission such amendment or supplement, whether by filing documents pursuant to the Exchange Act or otherwise, as may be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement comply with such requirements.
(c) If the Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Shares at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event
 
shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to comply with applicable law, the Company will prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Disclosure Package so that the statements in the Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not contain any statement of untrue material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements not misleading, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, or so that the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.
(d) The Company will make generally available to its security holders as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 18 months after the date of this Agreement relating to the Shares, earnings statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act (including, at the option of the Company, Rule 158 under the Act).
(e) The Company, during the period when the Prospectus is required by the Act to be delivered in connection with sales of such Shares, will, except in the case of reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, give you notice of its intention to file any amendment to the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, whether pursuant to the Act or otherwise and will furnish you with copies of any such amendment or supplement or other documents proposed to be filed in a reasonable time for review by the Underwriters in advance of filing.

The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if any such stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
 
(g) The Company will deliver to each of you, as soon as practicable, as many conformed copies of the Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of each amendment thereto (including, except to the extent available on EDGAR, exhibits filed therewith or incorporated by reference therein and documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the Disclosure Package pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Act) as you may reasonably request and will also deliver to you, upon your request, a conformed copy of the Registration Statement and each amendment thereto for each of the Underwriters.

In each jurisdiction in which such Shares or the sale thereof shall have been qualified as above provided, the Company will cooperate with you to make and file such statements and reports in each year as may be required by the laws of such jurisdiction. The Company will cooperate in the determination of the eligibility for investment of the Shares under the laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably request.

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, provided that the indemnifying party shall reimburse any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party for separate counsel (including a local counsel) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party or (ii) the named parties in any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any action or related action in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time the indemnified party shall have requested in writing that the indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 8, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and
 
expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to appropriate local counsel) at any time for any indemnified party in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
(d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company hereunder. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 8(d).
Contribution
(e) . The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Control Persons
 
Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Shares. If the purchase of the Shares by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Shares, and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 8 hereof shall remain in effect. In addition, if any Shares have been purchased under this Agreement, the representations and warranties in Section 3 hereof and all obligations under Section 4 hereof shall also remain in effect.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.
10. . If one or more of the Underwriters participating in an offering of Shares shall fail at the time of purchase and any applicable additional time of purchase, as the case may be, to purchase the Shares which it or they are obligated to purchase at such time under this Agreement (the ""), then such of you as are named therein shall have the right, within 36 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Shares in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, during such 36 hours you shall not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the Defaulted Shares, and if the Company shall not have completed arrangements for the purchase of all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Shares by other underwriters satisfactory to such of you as are named in this Agreement, then:
Default
Defaulted Shares
(a) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Shares does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Shares to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations under this Agreement bear to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters; or
(b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Shares exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Shares to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate, without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company except, in each case, as provided in Sections 8 and 9 hereof.
 
No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages in respect of any default of such Underwriter hereunder.
In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters as set forth in this Section which does not result in a termination of this Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase and any applicable additional time of purchase, as the case may be, for a period of not exceeding seven days in order that any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
11. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed, or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to you, c/o UBS Securities LLC, 299 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10171-0026, Attention: Syndicate Department and c/o Barclays Capital Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10019, Attention: Equities Syndicate Department; and notices to the Company shall be directed to it at: 1201 Lake Robbins Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380-1046, attention of Vice President and Treasurer, or to such other address or person as may be designated in any such notice.
Notices.
12. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon you and the Company, and any Underwriters who becomes party to this Agreement and their respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned herein is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto or thereto and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Section 8 hereof and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. This Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties and their respective successors and such controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of any Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
Parties.
13. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
GOVERNING LAW.
14. This Agreement may be signed by the parties in counterparts which together shall constitute one and the same agreement among the parties and shall become effective at such time as each of the parties shall have signed such counterparts and shall have notified the other parties thereof.
Counterparts.
15. The Company acknowledges and agrees that:
Absence of Fiduciary Relationship.
(a) The Underwriters have been retained solely to act as underwriters in connection with the sale of the Shares and that no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Company and the Underwriters have been created
No Other Relationship.
 
in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Prospectus, irrespective of whether the Underwriters have advised or are advising the Company on other matters;
(b) The price of the Shares was established by the Company following discussions and arm's-length negotiations with you, and the Company is capable of evaluating and understanding and understands and accepts the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
Arm's-Length Negotiations.
(c) The Company has been advised that the Underwriters and their affiliates are engaged in a broad range of transactions which may involve interests that differ from those of the Company, and that the Underwriters have no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions to the Company by virtue of any fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship; and
Absence of Obligation to Disclose.
(d) The Company waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims it may have against the Underwriters for breach of fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agrees that the Underwriters shall have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to the Company in respect of such a fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting a fiduciary duty claim on behalf of or in right of the Company, including stockholders, employees or creditors of the Company.
Waiver.
16. . The statements set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus and the statements set forth in under the caption "Underwriting" in the Prospectus, only insofar as such statements relate to the amount of selling concession and reallowance or to over-allotment and stabilization activities that may be undertaken by the Underwriters, constitute the only information furnished by or on behalf of the Underwriters, as such information is referred to in this Agreement.
Information Furnished by the Underwriters
17. . The Company acknowledges that the Underwriters' research analysts and research departments are required to be independent from their respective investment banking divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and that such Underwriters' research analysts may hold views and make statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with respect to the Company and/or the offering that differ from the views of their respective investment banking divisions. The Company hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company may have against the Underwriters with respect to any conflict of interest that may arise from the fact that the views expressed by their independent research analysts and research departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice communicated to the Company by such Underwriters' investment banking divisions. The Company acknowledges that each of the Underwriters is a full service securities firm and as such from time to time, subject to applicable securities laws, may effect transactions for its own account or the account of its customers and hold long or short positions in debt or equity securities of the companies that may be the subject of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Research Analyst Independence
 
18. . UBS, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG, is not a bank and is separate from any affiliated bank, including any U.S. branch or agency of UBS AG. Because UBS is a separately incorporated entity, it is solely responsible for its own contractual obligations and commitments, including obligations with respect to sales and purchases of securities. Shares sold, offered or recommended by UBS are not deposits, are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are not guaranteed by a branch or agency, and are not otherwise an obligation or responsibility of a branch or agency.
