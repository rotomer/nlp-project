THIRD-QUARTER 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
Achieved record quarterly sales volumes (from retained properties), a 12-percent increase over third-quarter 2008
Reduced lease operating expense (LOE) per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) by 9 percent sequentially over the second-quarter 2009, and by 15 percent year-to-date over the comparable nine-month period in 2008
Announced deepwater drilling successes in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa
Received Ghanaian government approval for the Jubilee field Phase I development plan
The positive third-quarter results continue to demonstrate the value of Anadarkos portfolio, with strong performance from both our producing assets and deepwater exploration program, Anadarko Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett said. Our exploration, drilling and operations teams continued to perform very well in achieving record sales volumes, lower costs, increased efficiencies and differentiating deepwater drilling success.
Third-quarter 2009 sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids totaled 57 million BOE, or 616,000 BOE per day, comprised of natural gas sales volumes that averaged 2.144 billion cubic feet per day, oil sales volumes that averaged 205,000 barrels per day and natural gas liquids sales volumes that averaged 54,000 barrels per day.
As a result of both improved operating performance and the absence of severe weather in the Gulf of Mexico, we expect our full-year sales volumes to be approximately 220 million BOE, up from our original midpoint of 210 million BOE at the beginning of the year, without increasing capital spending, continued Hackett. This equates to a forecasted growth rate of approximately 7 percent over our 2008 total sales volumes of 206 million BOE, while spending approximately 35 percent less capital on near-term projects.
In July, Anadarko announced the Vito exploration well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico encountered more than 250 net feet of oil pay in Miocene sands. This success was followed by the announcement of the Venus discovery offshore Sierra Leone in September. The results of the Venus well confirmed the existence of an active petroleum system in this frontier basin, thereby enhancing the prospectivity of the companys approximately 8 million gross acres offshore West Africa.
Anadarko also continued to make significant progress on its mega projects in West Africa and in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore Ghana, Anadarko and its partners successfully drilled the Mahogany-4 appraisal well. The well, which was located outside the existing Jubilee Unit boundary, encountered more than 140 net feet of oil pay and expanded the potential productive area of the Jubilee field to the south and east. Also in Ghana, the Jubilee project reached an important milestone during the third quarter, as the Ghanaian government formally approved the Jubilee field Phase I Plan of Development and Unitization Agreement. The partnership has drilled approximately 70 percent of the development wells in the field, awarded all contracts and completed about 70 percent of the construction work on the FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading vessel). Jubilee remains on schedule to achieve first production during the fourth quarter of 2010.
In the Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter, the company successfully drilled a development well near the Tonga West discovery as part of the Caesar/Tonga complex in the Green Canyon area. The well encountered more than 500 net feet of oil pay, and it will be tied back to Anadarkos Constitution spar. The partnership is currently drilling another development well in the complex, a sidetrack to the original Caesar discovery, which will be the third of four expected subsea wells in the development. The project currently remains on schedule, with first production expected in early 2011.
