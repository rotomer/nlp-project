FIRST-QUARTER 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
Achieved record quarterly sales volumes
Reduced lease operating expenses per unit by 32 percent vs. first-quarter 2009
Drilled three successful deepwater appraisal wells
Announced the first discovery in a frontier basin offshore Mozambique
Closed $1.5 billion joint-venture agreement in the Marcellus Shale
During the first quarter of 2010, we continued to build upon the success of 2009 and again delivered significant growth, said Jim Hackett, Anadarko Chairman and CEO. In the first quarter of this year, our reported sales volumes increased by about 15 percent relative to the first quarter of 2009, and weve further improved our cost-control efforts and the strength of our balance sheet. With the strong and consistent performance of our producing properties, we are raising our full-year sales volumes guidance to a range of 230 million to 234 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent)  equivalent to an increase of 3.5 million BOE in the estimated midpoint.
Anadarkos deepwater drilling program also delivered strong results with three successful appraisal wells  offshore Ghana at Tweneboa and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Lucius and Vito. The company plans to continue delineation activities this year on each of these emerging mega projects. In addition, Anadarko made a new discovery offshore Mozambique at the Windjammer prospect. This was the first deepwater well in the Rovuma Basin, and encountered more than 555 net feet of natural gas pay, proving the presence of an active hydrocarbon system in the basin and validating the prospectivity of Anadarkos large acreage position.
First-quarter 2010 sales volumes of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids totaled 62 million BOE, or 686,000 BOE per day. Reported sales volumes for the quarter included approximately 1.9 million BOE from a royalty price threshold adjustment related to the companys 2009 Gulf of Mexico natural gas sales. First-quarter 2010 natural gas sales volumes averaged approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet per day. Oil sales volumes in the first quarter averaged 222,000 barrels per day and natural gas liquids sales volumes averaged 65,000 barrels per day.
OPERATIONS UPDATE
During the first quarter of 2010, Anadarko closed the previously announced $1.5 billion joint-venture agreement with Mitsui E&P USA LLC, an affiliate of Mitsui & Co., Ltd., whereby Mitsui will earn a 32.5-percent interest in Anadarkos Marcellus Shale assets by funding nearly all of Anadarkos development costs through 2013. Anadarko also acquired more than 80,000 net acres in the liquids-rich portion of the Eagleford Shale in the Maverick Basin from TXCO for approximately $93 million and increased its working interest in all of its Eagleford properties to 75 percent. Additionally, the company further strengthened its balance sheet by refinancing a portion of its near-term debt maturities.
Anadarko continues to advance its three sanctioned mega projects, Jubilee, Caesar/Tonga and El Merk, toward first production on time and on budget. Installation of subsea infrastructure and equipment is under way at the Jubilee field offshore Ghana. The sail-away of the FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading) vessel, from Singapore to Ghana, is scheduled for later this month, with first production from the Jubilee field on schedule for the end of this year.
In early April, Anadarko announced the successful pre-salt drillstem test at the Wahoo#1 well offshore Brazil. The company believes the well will be capable of producing at a sustained rate in excess of 15,000 barrels of high-quality oil per day. Anadarko has moved the drillship to the Wahoo#2 well to conduct its second drillstem test in the field, before mobilizing the rig to drill the Wahoo South exploration well later this quarter.
About two weeks ago, in the Gulf of Mexico, the BP-operated Macondo exploration well on Mississippi Canyon block 252 discovered an oil accumulation. As reported in the press, an explosion and fire occurred on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig during operations. The rig subsequently sank, hydrocarbons were released into the Gulf and a large-scale well-control and clean-up effort has ensued. Anadarko is a 25-percent working interest owner in this block, which is operated by BP Exploration & Production, Inc. A full response and investigation is being conducted by the operator of the well, the drilling rig owner and governmental entities. The company maintains insurance policies designed to provide financial protection for such events, for its share of gross covered costs up to an aggregate level of approximately $710 million, less deductibles. Based on its 25-percent non-operated interest, the company estimates its net insurance coverage will likely total approximately $177.5 million, less deductibles of $15 million.
