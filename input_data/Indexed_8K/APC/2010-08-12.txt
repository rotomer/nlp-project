     (c) If the Disclosure Package is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to comply with applicable law, the Company will prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Disclosure Package so that the statements in the Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not contain any statement of untrue material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements not misleading, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, or so that the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

Indemnification of Company
Underwriter Indemnified Party
     (c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
Actions against Parties; Notification
 
indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, provided that the indemnifying party shall reimburse any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party for separate counsel (including a local counsel) if (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party or (ii) the named parties in any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and the indemnified party reasonably determines that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any action or related action in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all indemnified parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time the indemnified party shall have requested in writing that the indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 7, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to appropriate local counsel) at any time for any indemnified party in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions arising in the same jurisdiction out of the same general allegations or circumstances.
     (d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters from the Company hereunder. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or
Contribution
 
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 7(d).
     (e) . The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
Control Persons
     Section 8. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to the Terms Agreement (including these Standard Provisions) will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. If the purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than because of the termination of the Terms Agreement pursuant to Sections 5(c)(iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) or Section 9 hereof, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Securities, and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters pursuant to Section 7 hereof shall remain in effect. In addition, if any Securities have been purchased under the Terms Agreement, the representations and warranties in Section 1 hereof and all obligations under Section 3 hereof shall also remain in effect.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations
     Section 9. . If one or more of the Underwriters participating in an offering of Securities shall fail at the applicable Closing Date or Option Closing Date, as the case may be, to purchase the Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase at such time under the applicable Terms Agreement (the ""), then such of you as are named therein shall have the right, within 36 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth. If, however, during such 36 hours you shall not have completed such arrangements for the purchase of all of the Defaulted Securities, and if the Company shall not have completed arrangements for the purchase of all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Securities by other underwriters satisfactory to such of you as are named in the applicable Terms Agreement, then:
Default
Defaulted Securities
     (a) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that
 
their respective underwriting obligations under the applicable Terms Agreement bear to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters; or
     (b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement shall terminate, without any liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company except, in each case, as provided in Sections 7 and 8 hereof.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages in respect of any default of such Underwriter hereunder and the applicable Terms Agreement.
     In the event of a default by any Underwriter or Underwriters as set forth in this Section which does not result in a termination of the applicable Terms Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the applicable Closing Date or Option Closing Date, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding seven days in order that any required changes in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
     Section 10. . All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed, or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication. Notices to the Underwriters shall be directed to you, at the address indicated in the applicable Terms Agreement; and notices to the Company shall be directed to it at: 1201 Lake Robbins Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380-1046, attention of Vice President and Treasurer, or to such other address or person as may be designated in any such notice.

These Standard Provisions shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon you and the Company, and any Terms Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and any Underwriter who becomes a party to a Terms Agreement, and their respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned herein or any Terms Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto or thereto and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Section 7 hereof and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of these Standard Provisions or a Terms Agreement or any provision herein or therein contained. These Standard Provisions and any Terms Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof and thereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties and their respective successors and such controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of any Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase.
Parties
     Section 12. . THESE STANDARD PROVISIONS AND EACH TERMS AGREEMENT, AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THESE STANDARD PROVISIONS AND EACH TERMS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

Absence of Fiduciary Relationship
     (a) . The Underwriters have been retained solely to act as underwriters in connection with the sale of the Securities and that no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between the Company and the Underwriters have been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement (including these Standard Provisions incorporated by reference therein) or the Prospectus, irrespective of whether the Underwriters have advised or are advising the Company on other matters;
No Other Relationship

Absence of Obligation to Disclose

Waiver
     Section 15. . In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
