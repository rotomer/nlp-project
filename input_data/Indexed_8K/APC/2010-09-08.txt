Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On September 2, 2010, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ("Anadarko") entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among Anadarko as the borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., DnB Nor Bank ASA, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Socit Gnrale, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as syndication agents, and the several lenders party thereto, providing for a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The aggregate initial commitments of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are $5.0 billion. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 2, 2015, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest under one of two rate options, at Anadarko's election, at either (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% and (c) the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.0%, or (ii) LIBOR, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility will vary depending on Anadarko's corporate ratings (i) in the case of LIBOR loans, from 2.75% to 3.75% or (ii) in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, as defined in the Credit Agreement, from 1.75% to 2.75%. Upon Anadarko's entry into the Revolving Credit Facility, (i) approximately $295 million in letters of credit supported under Anadarko's existing undrawn $1.3 billion revolving credit facility were transferred to the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) approximately $101 million in pre-existing letters of credit issued by lenders party to the Credit Agreement were deemed to be secured thereunder and (iii) Anadarko's existing undrawn $1.3 billion revolving credit facility was retired. Anadarko does not have any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.
     The Credit Agreement contains various covenants with which Anadarko must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, investments, liens on assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and other provisions customary in similar types of agreements. Anadarko is also required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, (1) a maximum leverage ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDAX, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 4.5 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter ending on or before December 31, 2011 and 4.0 to 1.0 thereafter (calculated for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on such quarterly date), (2) a minimum ratio of Consolidated Current Assets to Consolidated Current Liabilities, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 1.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter and (3) a minimum Collateral Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of 1.75 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter, based in part on the annually determined present value of proved reserves included in exploration and production assets in the United States mortgaged to the secured parties and the annually determined market value of oil and gas properties owned directly or indirectly by certain foreign subsidiaries, 65% of whose capital stock is pledged to the secured parties. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains other customary conditions, representations and warranties, events of default and indemnification provisions.
     The indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, along with certain hedging obligations owed to lenders or their affiliates and certain treasury-management obligations owed to lenders or their affiliates, is guaranteed by certain of Anadarko's direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and secured by a perfected first priority security interest in certain of Anadarko's and its subsidiaries' exploration and production assets located in the United States, as well as 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries.
     The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated into this Item 1.01 by reference.
     Affiliates of certain of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility have provided from time to time, and may provide in the future, investment and commercial banking and financial advisory services to Anadarko and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions.

     The information set forth under Item 1.01 above hereby is incorporated into this Item 2.03 by reference.

          (b) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or
 
transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by each Issuing Lender) to the appropriate Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with Section 2.05(c)), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.

          (d) (i) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each LC Participant, and, to induce each Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each Lender irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such Lender's own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage in each Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by any Issuing Lender thereunder. Each Lender agrees with each Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which any Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (or in the event that any reimbursement received by an Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by it at any time), such Lender shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the amount that is not so reimbursed (or is so returned). Each Lender's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any
 
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may have against any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in ARTICLE VI, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
     (ii) If any amount required to be paid by any Lender to any Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(d)(i) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by an Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Lender shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of (x) such amount, (y) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender, (z) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(d)(i) is not made available to an Issuing Lender by such Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans. A certificate of an Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

     (iii) Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender its share of such payment in accordance with Section 2.05(d)(i), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such Lender its share thereof; , that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such Lender shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it.

provided
 
that such payment be financed with an Alternate Base Rate Loan or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Loan.
     (ii) If after giving effect to any Reimbursement Obligation arising from any LC Disbursement, the aggregate Money Borrowed Obligations would exceed the Equal and Ratable Limit as of the fiscal quarter ended not earlier than 150 days prior to such Reimbursement Obligation, the portion of such Reimbursement Obligation equal to the amount by which the Money Borrowed Obligations exceeds the Equal and Ratable Limit shall not be deemed to be secured by Principal Property Collateral.

To the extent permitted by law, none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any Issuing Lender or any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of an Issuing Lender; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Lender from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Lender's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. To the extent permitted by law, the parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Lender, such Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
provided
 
          (g) Each Issuing Lender shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Such Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Lender has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
provided
          (h) If an Issuing Lender shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date specified in Section 2.05(e), the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such reimbursement is due pursuant to Section 2.05(e) to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans; that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.05(e), then the provisions of Section 2.09(a) pertaining to interest payable on overdue principal shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(d)(i) to reimburse such Issuing Lender shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
provided
          (i) Any Issuing Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of any replaced Issuing Lender. From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) each successor Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter, and (ii) references herein to the term "" shall be deemed to refer to such successor.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.11(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then each such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the cost incurred by the Administrative Agent for making such Lender's share of such Loan and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such borrowing.

Section 2.12 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments
          (a) Each Loan from the Lenders, each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of the principal of and interest on the Loans and on account of any fees hereunder, any reimbursement of LC Disbursements, and any reduction of the Total Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the Applicable Percentages, except that (i) payments or prepayments, and offsets against or reductions from the amount of payments and prepayments, in each case, specifically for the account of a particular Lender under the terms of Section 2.13, Section 2.15, Section 2.20, Section 9.03 or Section 9.13 shall be made for the account of such Lender (or the Swingline Lenders in the case of Section 2.21), and (ii) if any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender, from and after the date upon which such Lender shall have become a Defaulting Lender, any payment made on account of principal of or interest on the Loans shall be applied, first for the account of the Lenders other than the Defaulting Lender, pro rata according to the Commitments of such Lenders, until the principal of and interest on the
 
Loans of such Lenders shall have been paid in full and, second for the account of such Defaulting Lender, that the application of such payments in accordance with this clause (ii) shall not constitute an Event of Default or a Default, and no payment of principal of or interest on the Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall be considered to be overdue for purposes of Section 2.09(a), if, had such payments been applied without regard to this clause (ii), no such Event of Default or Default would have occurred and no such payment of principal of or interest on the Loans of such Defaulting Lender would have been overdue. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal, interest, reimbursement of LC Disbursements and fees shall be made in immediately available funds without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders (or on behalf of any Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lenders, as the case may be) at the Administrative Agent's office as notified to the Borrower from time to time at least five (5) Business Days before any change in such office.

          (b) If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
          (c) Except as provided in Section 2.13, Section 2.15, Section 2.20, Section 9.03 and Section 9.13, if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender (other than, in the case of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lenders), then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements with respect to the Loans and LC Exposure of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by such Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and

counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or any Issuing Lender, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or an Issuing Lender, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the cost incurred by the Administrative Agent for making such distributed amount and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(d), Section 2.11(b), Section 2.12(d) or 2.21(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, such Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
     .
Section 2.13 Increased Cost of Loans
          (a) If the adoption of or any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental regulation after the date of this Agreement, or in the interpretation or application thereof after the date of this Agreement, or compliance by any Lender or Recipient with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made or issued after the date of this Agreement:
     (i) shall subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Other Connection Taxes on gross or net income, profits or receipts (including value-added or similar Taxes) and (C) the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Taxes payable by any Recipient) on its Loans, LC Participations, Commitment or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto;
     (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate; or
     (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
 
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount that such Lender or other Recipient deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans (or in the case of (i) any Loan) or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall pay such Lender or such other Recipient any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such other Recipient for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable, , that if all or any such additional cost would not have been payable, or such reduction would not have occurred, but for such Lender's or other Recipients refusal to change to another Eurodollar Lending Office or Domestic Lending Office as provided in Section 2.14, the Borrower shall have no obligation under this Section 2.13 to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Lender for such amount. Such demand shall be accompanied by a certificate of a duly authorized officer of such Lender or such other Recipient setting forth the amount of such payment and the basis therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Lender or Issuing Lender shall demand payment pursuant to this Section 2.13, the Borrower may, upon at least three (3) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent and such Lender, continue in whole (but not in part) the Eurodollar Loans of such Lender into Alternate Base Rate Loans without regard to the requirements of Section 2.09. If any Lender or other Recipient becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
provided, however
          (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption after the date of this Agreement of any law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof after the date of this Agreement or compliance by any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or Governmental Authority made or issued after the date of this Agreement, does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction; , that the foregoing shall not apply to any capital adequacy requirement imposed solely by reason of any business combination of a Lender effected after the date hereof.
provided, however
          (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 2.13 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such payment. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any other Recipient to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall not constitute a waiver of such
 
Lender's or such other Recipient's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender other Recipient pursuant to this Section 2.13 for any amounts incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of such Lender's or such other Recipient's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the change in law or circumstance giving rise to such claim has a retroactive effect, then the 270 day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.
provided
provided further
     . Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.13 or 2.15 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15.
Section 2.14 Change of Lending Office
     . (a) . Each payment by or on behalf of any Loan Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
Section 2.15 Taxes
Withholding of Taxes; Gross-Up
          (b) . The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
          (c) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Evidence of Payments
          (d) . The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.15(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.15(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount
Indemnification by the Borrower
 
so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.15(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Lenders
          (f) . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.15(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
Status of Lenders
     (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is a U.S. Person, any Lender with respect to the Borrower shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:
     (A) in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
     (B) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (1) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the

     (C) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under any Loan Document constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender's conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;
     (D) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) IRS Form W-8BEN and (2) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I (a "") to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code (c) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (d) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected;
U.S. Tax Certificate
     (E) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under any Loan Document (including a partnership or a participating Lender) (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this paragraph (f)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender; , , that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; or
provided
however
     (F) any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.
     (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and
 
withhold from such payment. For purposes of this Section 2.15(f)(iii), FATCA shall include any changes in applicable law, regulations or official interpretations thereof.
          (g) . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.15 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.15), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.15(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
          (h) . Each party's obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Total Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under this Agreement.
Survival
     . If, prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Tranche, the Majority Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that (a) by reason of changes affecting the London Interbank Eurodollar Market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for such requested Interest Period, or (b) LIBOR for such requested Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period, then (i) the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to the Borrower, (ii) unless, on the date upon which such Eurodollar Loans were to be made, the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that it elects not to borrow on such date, any Eurodollar Loans having such requested Interest Period (or any other Interest Periods for which either clause (a) or (b) are applicable) requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, (iii) any Loans having such requested Interest Period (or any other Interest Periods for which either clause (a) or (b) are applicable) that were to have been continued as Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as Alternate Base Rate Loans on the date upon which such Loans were to have been continued, and (iv) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans having such requested Interest Period (or any other Interest Periods for which either clause (a) or (b) are applicable) shall be continued, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, as Alternate Base Rate Loans on the date upon which such Loans are to be continued. The Administrative Agent shall give written notice to the Borrower of any event occurring after the giving of such notice which permits an adequate and fair means of ascertaining LIBOR and until such notice by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to continue as Eurodollar Loans.
Section 2.16 Substitute Loan Basis
 
     . If the Eurodollar Loans of any Lender must be funded or continued as Alternate Base Rate Loans pursuant to Section 2.13 (such Eurodollar Loans being herein called ""), unless and until such Lender gives written notice that the circumstances which gave rise to such substitute loan basis no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) such Lender shall not make further Affected Loans and all Loans which would otherwise be made by such Lender as, or continued by such Lender into, Affected Loans shall be made instead as, or continued as Alternate Base Rate Loans (on which interest and principal shall be payable simultaneously with the related Loans of the other Lenders).

          (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swingline Lender severally agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to, but not including, the Termination Date, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $200,000,000 or (ii) the total Credit Exposures exceeding the total Commitments; that no Swingline Lender shall be obligated to make any Swingline Loan that would result in the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans outstanding by such Swingline Lender to exceed its Swingline Limit; that no Swingline Lender shall be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan.

provided further
          (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (confirmed by facsimile), not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the appropriate Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Lender) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
          (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may have against any Swingline Lender, any Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in ARTICLE VI, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Lender. Each Lender shall comply with its
 
obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.11 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.11 shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lenders the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear; that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon (a) any instrument, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy or email message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and (b) the advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower) with respect to legal matters, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof satisfactory to the Administrative Agent signed by such payee shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.
Section 8.07 Reliance on Documents
     . With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as any Lender, and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include each Agent in its individual capacity. Each Agent and its respective Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as if it were not an Agent.
Section 8.08 Rights as a Lender
     . Each Lender represents to the Agents that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or on any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Borrower and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their Affiliates. The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by any Loan Party of this Agreement or any other document referred to or provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of any Loan Party. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of a Loan Party that may at any time come into possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.
Section 8.09 Non-Reliance on Agents or other Lenders
     . If the Administrative Agent receives knowledge or notice of any Default or Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
Section 8.10 Events of Default
 
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder until it shall have received a written notice from the Borrower or any Lender referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default." The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
provided
     . Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a), Section 7.01(g) or Section 7.01(h) with respect to the Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After an Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent.
Section 8.11 Successor Agent
     . Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to impose any responsibility, obligation or duty whatsoever hereunder on any Syndication Agent.
Section 8.12 Syndication Agent
     . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any Loan Document, in relation to the Dutch Parallel Debts and any Lien governed by Dutch law (including the Netherlands Pledge Agreement): (a) the Administrative Agent shall act in its own name and not as agent of any Credit Party (but always for the benefit of the Credit Parties in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Documents); (b) the rights, powers and authorities vested in the Administrative Agent pursuant to the Loan Documents are subject to any restrictions imposed by mandatory Dutch law; and (c) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to accept the Dutch Parallel Debts on behalf of each of the Credit Parties, notwithstanding the foregoing.
Section 8.13 Act in its Own Name
     . If the Administrative Agent resigns in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII, each Obligor shall execute such
Section 8.14 Further Assurance for Dutch Parallel Debts
 
documents and take all such other action as is necessary or (in the opinion of the Administrative Agent) desirable in connection with the substitution, in accordance with applicable law, of the successor Administrative Agent as creditor of the Dutch Parallel Debts and as beneficiary of any Lien securing the Dutch Parallel Debts.

Section 9.02 Waivers; Amendments
 
          (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under the Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender, any Swingline Lender and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any Swingline Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Event of Default at the time.
          (b) None of this Agreement, any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Majority Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Majority Lenders; that no such agreement shall (i) forgive the principal amount of any Loan or extend the Termination Date, reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except (x) in connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates (which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Majority Lenders) and (y) that any amendment or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof (it being understood that prepayments under Section 2.08 are not "scheduled" dates of payment), or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's Commitment, in each case without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this Section 9.02 without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby or any Person party to a Specified Swap Agreement if such Person or its Affiliate is not then a Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Majority Lenders, consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, in each case without the written consent of all Lenders; (iv) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, in each case without the written consent of all Lenders; (v) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.12 without the written consent of each Lender; (vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of ARTICLE VIII or any other provision of any Loan Document that affects the Administrative Agent without the written consent of the Administrative Agent; (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 9.13 or 9.14 without the written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lenders (and in the case of the percentage specified in clause (iii) of Section 9.13, such amendment shall require consent of the Majority Lenders (with the percentage in such definition being deemed 75% for this purpose)); (viii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.05 without the written consent of each Issuing Lender directly affected thereby; (ix) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.21 without the written consent of each Swingline
provided
 
Lender directly affected thereby or (x) subordinate or alter the pro rata sharing provisions in any manner adversely to any Lender or any other Person party to a Specified Swap Agreement if such Person or its Affiliate is not then a Lender. Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans. In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Majority Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Extensions of Credit and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (ii) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Majority Lenders.
