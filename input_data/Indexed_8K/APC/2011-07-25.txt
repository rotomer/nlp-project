"We achieved record liquids sales volumes during the quarter, enhancing margins and generating excellent cash flows," said Anadarko Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett. "Nearly all of the year-over-year volume growth was attributable to a 34,000 barrel-per-day increase in liquids volumes. These results contributed to strong discretionary cash flows of more than $1.8 billion  approximately $117 million above our capital expenditures, which included a one-time cash investment of $518 million associated with the acquisition of the Wattenberg plant."
During the second quarter of 2011, sales volumes totaled 62 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), or 685,000 BOE per day, averaging approximately 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, 225,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD), and 72,000 barrels of natural gas liquids per day.

The company achieved sales-volumes records during the second quarter of 2011 in Wattenberg, Greater Natural Buttes, Wamsutter (operated), Bone Spring and the Marcellus Shale. In the Eagleford Shale, Anadarko closed its $1.6 billion joint-venture agreement with a subsidiary of Korea National Oil Corporation and exited the quarter with record gross sales volumes of approximately 45,000 BOE per day in the play, an increase of approximately 25 percent from the end of the prior quarter. In Ghana, current gross production from Jubilee is approximately 80,000 BOPD, and production continues to ramp up with further well completions and gas injection.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko continued to advance two major projects during the second quarter. The company finalized the Lucius unitization agreement and recently announced plans to develop the field with a truss spar designed for a capacity of 80,000 BOPD and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Sanctioning is expected to occur later this year, with first production expected in 2014. At the Caesar/Tonga project, Anadarko completed flow and reservoir tests on three wells.

Below are reconciliations of cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to discretionary cash flow from operations and free cash flow (non-GAAP), and net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP) as required under Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management uses discretionary cash flow from operations and free cash flow to demonstrate the Company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt. It is useful in comparisons of oil and gas exploration and production companies because it excludes fluctuations in assets and liabilities. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company's operational trends and performance.
