This Form 8-K/A is being filed as an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 20, 2011 (the "Original Report"). The sole purpose of this amendment is to disclose the Company's decision regarding how frequently it will conduct stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. No other changes have been made to the Original Report.
Item 5.07. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
At the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 17, 2011, the Company's stockholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal regarding the frequency of holding advisory votes on executive compensation. As previously reported in the Original Report, the stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, an annual advisory vote on compensation for the Company's named executive officers.
In light of these results, the Company's Board of Directors determined at a meeting held on August 1, 2011, that the Company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next stockholder advisory vote on this matter, which, in accordance with applicable law, will occur no later than the Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2017.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
