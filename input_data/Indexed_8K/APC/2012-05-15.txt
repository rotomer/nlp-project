Item 5.02. Departure, election, or appointment of directors or officers; compensatory arrangements of officers
The 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan
On February 16 2012, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (the "Company") approved the Company's 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Omnibus Plan"), subject to the final approval of the Company's stockholders. The Omnibus Plan was then submitted to the Company's stockholders at its Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 15, 2012 (the "2012 Annual Meeting"), and the Omnibus Plan became effective upon the Company's receipt of its stockholders' approval of the Omnibus Plan at the 2012 Annual Meeting. Unless terminated earlier, the Omnibus Plan will remain effective until all of the shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance have been issued, or the tenth anniversary of the Omnibus Plan's effective date. The purpose of the Omnibus Plan is to provide a means through which the Company may attract, motivate and retain experienced and highly qualified individuals who are in a position to contribute materially to the success and long-term objectives of the Company. Employees of the Company, or any subsidiary of the Company, or a consultant that provides services to the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, including non-employee members of the Board, shall be eligible participants under the Omnibus Plan.
,
In connection with the approval of the Omnibus Plan, the Board has determined that no future grants of awards will be made under the Company's 2008 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2008 Omnibus Plan"). The equity awards previously granted under the 2008 Omnibus Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.
A maximum of 30,000,000 of the Company's shares of common stock (or 29,987,373 after reducing to give effect to awards granted under the 2008 Omnibus Plan after March 8, 2012 but prior to shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan) will be reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Plan. The shares to be delivered under the Omnibus Plan may be made available from any combination of shares held in the Company's treasury or authorized but unissued shares of the Company's common stock. The Omnibus Plan will be administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") with respect to all participants who are subject to the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Section 16 Insiders"), or with respect to individuals who are reasonably deemed to be a "Covered Employee" as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). With respect to participants other than Section 16 Insiders or Covered Employees, the Omnibus Plan may be administered by the Management Committee, which is comprised of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (so long as that officer is a member of the Board) and such other members of the Board as may be appointed to the Management Committee by the Board from time to time. The applicable plan administrator is responsible for administering the Omnibus Plan and has the discretionary power to interpret the terms and intent of the Omnibus Plan and any related documentation, to determine eligibility for awards and the terms and conditions of awards, to adopt rules, regulations, forms, instruments and guidelines and to exercise such powers and perform such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable to promote the best interests of the Company with respect to the Omnibus Plan.
The Omnibus Plan provides for awards of stock options (which may be designed to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, or they may be designed as nonstatutory stock options), stock appreciation rights (either in tandem with a stock option award or as a stand alone award), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards (which may be in the form of performance shares or performance units), incentive awards (cash awards) or "other" stock-based awards (which may include the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted shares of the Company's common stock or awards in lieu of obligations to pay cash or deliver property to an individual). The Omnibus Plan imposes annual per-participant award limits and all awards under the Omnibus Plan are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations as determined by the plan administrator.
Incentive awards that are intended to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code will be designed using certain predetermined performance goals which were approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting. These performance goals are listed in detail within the Omnibus Plan document attached hereto.
Unless otherwise provided in a participant's award agreement, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) of the Company and the termination of the participant's employment without cause or for good reason (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) during the protection period applicable to the participant, any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right will become fully exercisable, any outstanding performance share, performance unit, restricted stock, restricted
stock unit, other stock-based award or other cash award that was forfeitable will become non-forfeitable and fully vest, and to the extent applicable, will be converted into shares of the Company's common stock or cash.
Each participant's award shall be conditioned on repayment or forfeiture in accordance with any Company policy, applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and/or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and any relevant provisions in the related award agreement.
The Compensation Committee may amend the Omnibus Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interests of the Company, provided however that to the extent the amendment is required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule to be submitted for stockholder approval, the approval of the Board will also be obtained. No change can be made to any award granted under the Omnibus Plan without the consent of the participant if such change would impair the right of the participant under the provisions of the award to acquire or retain common stock or cash that the participant may have otherwise acquired.
The foregoing description of the Omnibus Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Omnibus Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.
Form Award Agreements
The Compensation Committee approved the terms of the form of award agreements to be used in connection with grants of stock options, restricted stock units and performance units to officers of the Company pursuant to the Omnibus Plan. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Omnibus Plan.
. The form stock option award agreement provides that the stock options will vest pro-rata over three years beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. In the event that the participant's service with the Company is terminated for any reason, all unvested stock option awards will generally be forfeited (without value) to the Company, with certain exceptions. If the termination occurs due to the participant's (1) death, (2) disability (as defined in the Company's disability plan), or (3) termination by the Company without Cause or a resignation by the participant for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, all unvested stock options will become vested and exercisable. If the participant is terminated for Cause, all stock options will be immediately forfeited, whether vested or unvested. All unexercised stock options shall expire seven years from the date of grant.
Stock Options
. The form restricted stock unit award agreement provides that each restricted stock unit will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock at the end of the applicable vesting period (less any shares of common stock withheld to satisfy payroll taxes). The restricted stock units will vest pro-rata over three years beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The participant will also be entitled to receive a dividend equivalent (a "Dividend Equivalent") with respect to each underlying share of common stock subject to the restricted stock unit award. Each Dividend Equivalent will be reinvested in additional shares of Company common stock to be paid to the participant, less applicable taxes, at the same time as each restricted stock unit to which the Dividend Equivalent relates vests and is settled. If the participant voluntarily terminates his employment other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control (including normal retirements), or the Company terminates the participant for Cause, all unvested restricted stock units and Dividend Equivalents will be immediately forfeited without value. Upon participant's (1) death, (2) disability (as defined in the Company's disability plan), (3) termination by the Company without Cause, or (4) termination for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, all unvested restricted stock units and Dividend Equivalents will immediately vest.
Restricted Stock Units
. The form performance unit award agreement will set forth the "target" number of performance unit awards granted to each participant. The performance goal applicable to the awards in the form agreements is Total Shareholder Return, or "TSR," over two separate performance periods. The TSR measure will be calculated by beginning with the average closing price of common stock on the last 30 trading days of an applicable performance period, subtracting the average closing price of common stock during the 30 day trading period preceding the first day of the performance period, and adding in any dividends paid per share of common stock during the performance period. That total number will then be divided by the average closing price of common stock for the 30 day trading period preceding the first day of the performance period. The TSR performance goal will be based upon the Company's TSR ranking in comparison to the TSR of a preselected peer group. Fifty percent of the performance units will be subject to a TSR performance period that will be measured over the first and second calendar years of the award, and fifty percent of the performance units will be subject to a TSR performance period that will be measured over the first, second and third calendar years of the award. If the participant is still employed at the end of the applicable performance period, the performance unit will vest and become payable in cash (less applicable payroll taxes) based upon the Company's TSR
Performance Units
ranking in comparison to that of its preselected peer group. The participant may earn from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance units originally granted to him.
During the performance period, if the participant voluntarily terminates his employment other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, or the Company terminates the participant for Cause, all unvested performance units will be immediately forfeited. Other than with respect to a Change of Control, if the participant's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause prior to the end of a performance period, the participant will be eligible to receive the settlement of the performance units following the end of the performance period and based upon actual performance results. If termination occurs due to the participant's (1) death, (2) disability (as defined in the Company's disability plan), or (3) termination by the Company without Cause or a resignation by the participant for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, all performance units will become vested and payable at the "target" level. In the event that the participant retires during a performance period, the participant will be eligible to receive the settlement of the performance units following the end of the performance period and based upon actual performance results the performance units, but on a pro-rata basis based upon the number of months worked during the performance period.
The foregoing descriptions of the form of award agreements for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and performance units pursuant to the Omnibus Plan are qualified in their entirety by reference to the award agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
In addition, the Compensation Committee approved the terms of the form of award letter to be used in connection with grants of restricted shares pursuant to the Company's 2008 Director Compensation Plan (the "Director Plan") to non-employee directors of the Company who are residents of the United Kingdom. The form award letter for restricted shares provides that each restricted share will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock at the end of the applicable vesting period. The restricted shares will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. The participant will also be entitled to receive cash dividends payable on a current basis with respect to each underlying share of common stock subject to the restricted share award and will have the right to vote such shares. If the participant voluntarily resigns from the Board, all unvested restricted shares will be immediately forfeited. If the participant's service on the Board is terminated as a result of participant's death or disability all unvested restricted shares will immediately vest. In the event of a change of control of the Company all unvested restricted shares will immediately vest, unless the participant continues to serve as a member of the Board or on the board of directors of the Company's successor.
The foregoing description of the form of award letter for grants of restricted shares pursuant to the Director Plan to non-employee directors of the Company who are residents of the United Kingdom is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of award letter, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated herein by reference.

Mr. Walker's awards will be governed by the Omnibus Plan and the form of award agreements for grants of such stock options, restricted stock units and performance units approved by the Compensation Committee, as described above and attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively.

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
Amended and Restated as of May 15, 2012
 
 
1.1.     The Corporation shall maintain a registered office in Delaware, and may maintain such other offices and keep its books, documents and records at such places within or without Delaware as may from time to time be designated by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (hereinafter the "Board" or the "Board of Directors").
2.1.     All meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be held at such place or places, if any, within or without the State of Delaware, as may from time to time be fixed by the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified or fixed in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.
2.2.     The Annual Meeting of Stockholders shall be held on such date and at such time as may be fixed by the Board and stated in the notice thereof, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of only such other business as is properly brought before the meeting in accordance with these By-Laws.
2.3.     Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by a majority of the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. The business transacted at a special meeting shall be confined to the purposes specified in the notice thereof. Special meetings shall be held at such date and at such time as the Board may designate.
2.4.     Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of meeting of stockholders shall be given that shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof. Unless otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the notice of any such meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of such meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
2.5.     Unless otherwise provided by law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present either in person or by proxy, shall
 
constitute a quorum at such meeting. Whether or not a quorum is present, the person presiding over the meeting or the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or by proxy, may adjourn the meeting from time to time to another time or place, at which time, if a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally scheduled. Notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or, if after the adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.6.     Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting shall be entitled, for each share held of record on the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting, to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder who has voting power on the question. Except as otherwise provided by these By-Laws, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if, as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the Corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 2.6 of these By-Laws, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election (with "abstentions" and "broker nonvotes" not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that director's election).
In order for any incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board of Directors for further service on the Board of Directors, such person must submit an irrevocable resignation, contingent on (i) that person not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, and (ii) acceptance of that resignation by the Board of Directors in accordance with the policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Directors for such purpose. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the nominating and governance committee, or such other committee designated by the Board of Directors pursuant to these Bylaws, shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release and filing an appropriate disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its decision regarding the resignation and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days following certification of the election results. The committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision each may consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant.
All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise provided by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, the
 
rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
Elections of directors need not be by ballot; provided however, that by resolution duly adopted, a vote by ballot may be required.
2.7.     Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date.
2.8.     The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
2.9.     .

The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
(3)     Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 2.9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered by mail to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10
th
) day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

The Plan Administrator may grant Awards subject to one or more Performance Goals set forth in the table below (collectively the "Performance Goals") to any Participant, including, without limitation, to any Covered Employee. As to any such Awards, the Plan Administrator shall establish one or more of the Performance Goals for each Performance Period in writing. Each Performance Goal selected for a particular Performance Period shall include any one or more of the following, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied to either the Company as a whole or to a Subsidiary or a business unit of the Company or any Subsidiary, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of time, on an absolute basis or relative to the pre-established target, to previous years' results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Plan Administrator:
 
 
The Plan Administrator may adjust the Performance Goals to include or exclude extraordinary charges, gains or losses on the disposition of business units, losses from discontinued operations, restatements and accounting changes and other unplanned special charges such as restructuring expenses, acquisitions, acquisition expenses, including expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, stock offerings, stock repurchases and loan loss provisions. The Plan Administrator may also provide for the manner in which performance will be measured against the Performance Goals (or may adjust the Performance Goals) to reflect the impact of specified corporate transactions, a Change in Capitalization, special charges, accounting policy changes and tax law changes. In addition, the Plan Administrator may make such adjustments to the Performance Goals applicable to Participants who are not Covered Employees as it determines are appropriate. Such adjustments may occur at the time of the granting of an Award, or at any time thereafter, but, in the case of Covered Employees, only to the extent permitted by Section 162(m). Performance Goals may include a threshold level of performance below which no Awards shall be earned, target levels of performance at which specific Awards will be earned, and a maximum level of performance at which the maximum level of Awards will be earned.
In establishing Performance Goals with respect to Covered Employees, the Plan Administrator shall ensure such Performance Goals (i) are established no later than the end of the first 90 days of the Performance Period (or such other time as may be required or permitted for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), if applicable), and (ii) satisfy all other applicable requirements imposed by Section 162(m), including the requirement that such Performance Goals be stated in terms of an objective formula or standard, and the Plan Administrator may not in any event increase the amount of compensation payable to a Covered Employee upon the satisfaction of any Performance Goal. Prior to the payment of any "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m), the Plan Administrator shall certify in writing (which shall be satisfied upon the Plan Administrator's approval of preambles and resolutions regarding such performance results and payout and without condition with respect to any subsequent approval of the minutes of the meeting relating to such certification) the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals were, in fact, achieved and the amounts to be paid, vested or delivered as a result thereof; provided, that the Plan Administrator may reduce, but not increase, such amount.
 
That period of time during which Performance Goals are evaluated to determine the vesting or granting of Awards under the Plan, as the Plan Administrator may determine, provided that the period is no longer than ten (10) years.
 
An Award granted under the Plan representing the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock for each Performance Share granted, as the Plan Administrator may determine.
 
An Award granted under the Plan representing the right to receive a payment (either in cash or Common Stock) equal to the value of a Performance Unit, as the Plan Administrator may determine.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of Options intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, the term "Subsidiary" shall mean a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for tax purposes) in which the Company directly or indirectly holds more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power.
 
(a)        As to an Employee, the time when the employee-employer relationship between a Participant and the Company or any Employer is terminated for any reason, including, without limitation, a termination by resignation, discharge, death, disability or retirement; but excluding terminations where the Participant simultaneously commences or remains in employment or service with the Company or any Employer.
(b)        As to a Consultant, the time when the engagement of a Participant as a Consultant to the Company or any Employer is terminated for any reason, with or without Cause, including, without limitation, by resignation, discharge, death or retirement, but excluding terminations where the Consultant simultaneously commences or remains in employment or service with the Company or any Employer.
 
(a)        The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board shall be the Plan Administrator with respect to all Covered Employees and all Section 16 Insiders. As to these officers, the Plan Administrator (including each individual that is a member thereof) shall be constituted at all times so as to (i) be "independent" as such term is defined pursuant to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed, and (ii) meet the non-employee director standards of Rule 16b-3 and the outside director requirements of Section 162(m), so long as any of the Company's equity securities are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act.
(b)        Other than as set forth in Section 3.1(a) and subject to Section 3.4 (and subject to applicable law), the Management Committee shall be the Plan Administrator. The Board may from time to time remove members from, or add members to, the Management Committee.
(c)        Notwithstanding Sections 3.1(a) and 3.1(b), the Board may designate itself or the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board as the Plan Administrator as to any Participant or groups of Participants unless such designation with respect to a Participant or groups of Participants would not be in compliance with the requirements of the Code, the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.
(d)        The above committees hereby designate the appropriate Employees or other agents of the Company to handle the day-to-day administrative matters of the Plan.
 
Subject to the express terms and conditions set forth herein, the Plan Administrator shall have the power from time to time to:
(a)        select the Participants to whom Awards shall be granted under the Plan and the number of shares or amount of cash subject to such Awards and prescribe the terms and conditions (which need not be identical) of each such Awards, including, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Option Price, vesting schedule and duration;
(b)        set the terms and conditions of any Award consistent with the terms of the Plan (which may be based on Performance Goals or other performance measures as the Plan Administrator shall determine), and make any amendments, modifications or adjustments to such Awards as are permitted by the Plan;
(c)        construe and interpret the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder and establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, correcting any defect or supplying any omission, or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award Agreement, in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or advisable, including so that the Plan and the operation of the Plan comply with Rule 16b-3, the Code, to the extent applicable, and other applicable laws, and otherwise to make the Plan fully effective;
(d)        exercise its discretion with respect to the powers and rights granted to it as set forth in the Plan; and
(e)        generally, exercise such powers and perform such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable to promote the best interests of the Company with respect to the Plan.
All decisions and determinations by the Plan Administrator in the exercise of the above powers shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company, a Subsidiary, the Participants and all other persons having or claiming any interest therein. The Plan Administrator shall cause the Company at the Company's expense to take any action related to the Plan which may be necessary to comply with the provisions of any federal, state or foreign law or any regulations issued thereunder, which the Plan Administrator determines are intended to be complied with. All Awards and any administrative action taken by the Plan Administrator shall be in conformity with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, citizenship, age, disability, marital or veterans status, sexual orientation or any other legally protected categories.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator shall not be entitled to exercise any discretion otherwise authorized hereunder with respect to any Awards held by Covered Employees if the ability to exercise such discretion or the exercise of such discretion itself would cause the compensation attributable to such Awards to fail to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m).
 
Each member of any committee acting as Plan Administrator, while serving as such, shall be entitled, in good faith, to rely or act upon any advice of the Company's independent auditors, counsel or consultants hired by the committee, or other agents assisting in the administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator and any Employee of the Company acting at the direction or on behalf of the Company shall not be personally liable for any action or determination taken or made, or not taken or made, in good faith with respect to the Plan, and shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected under the Company's charter or by-laws with respect to any such action or determination.
 
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Section 3.1, the Board and the Compensation and Benefits Committee hereby delegate to the Management Committee the authority (i) to designate the Employees and Consultants who shall be Participants, (ii) to determine the Awards to be granted to any such Participants or (iii) both (i) and (ii); provided, however, that the Management Committee shall not have the authority to grant Awards to any member of the Management Committee, a Covered Employee or a Section 16 Insider and shall be subject to such other limitations set forth in this Plan. This provision shall be deemed to constitute a delegation from the Board to the Management Committee without further action by the Board. However, the Board or the Compensation and Benefits Committee may, from time to time, limit the total number of shares Common Stock subject to such delegation.
To be eligible to be a Participant, an individual must be an Employee (other than an Employee who is a member of a unit subject to collective bargaining) or a Consultant of an Employer, as of the date on which the Plan Administrator grants to such individual an Award under the Plan. Members of the Board shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Each grant of an Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement.
 
(a)        
Share Authorization
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.3, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for grant to Participants under this Plan on or after the Effective Date shall be 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Awards granted under the Prior Plan after March
 
8, 2012 and prior to the Effective Date will reduce the 30,000,000 shares of Common Stock available for grant to Participants under the Plan as follows: 1.8 shares of Common Stock for every one (1) share of Common Stock related to a Full Value Award and one (1) share for every one (1) share of Common Stock related to an Award other than a Full Value Award.
(b)        
Limit on Full Value AwardsFlexible Share Pool
To the extent that a share of Common Stock is issued pursuant to the grant or exercise of a Full Value Award, it shall reduce the share authorization by 1.80 shares of Common Stock; and to the extent that a share of Common Stock is issued pursuant to the grant or exercise of an Award other than a Full Value Award, it shall reduce the share authorization by one (1) share of Common Stock.
(c)        
Limit on Incentive Stock Options
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.3, the maximum aggregate number of shares subject to Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be 10,000,000.
(d)        
Share Usage
Shares of Common Stock covered by an Award shall only be counted as used to the extent they are actually issued. Any shares of Common Stock related to Awards which terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of such shares of Common Stock or are settled in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock shall be available again for grant under this Plan. Such shares of Common Stock related to a Full Value Award shall increase the share authorization by 1.80 shares of Common Stock and shares of Common Stock related to an Award other than a Full Value Award shall increase the share authorization by one (1) share of Common Stock. However, the full number of Stock Appreciation Rights granted that are to be settled by the issuance of shares of Common Stock shall be counted against the number of shares of Common Stock available for award under the Plan, regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon settlement of such Stock Appreciation Rights. Furthermore, any shares of Common Stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations on an Award issued under the Plan, shares of Common Stock tendered to pay the exercise price of an Award under the Plan, and shares of Common Stock repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an Option exercise will no longer be eligible to be again available for grant under this Plan. In addition, the full number of Incentive Stock Options granted shall be counted against the number of Incentive Stock Options that may be awarded under the Plan pursuant to Section 5.1(c), regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Incentive Stock Options. The shares of Common Stock available for issuance under this Plan may be authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock or treasury shares of Common Stock.
 
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.3, the following limitations shall apply:
 
(a)        Options: The maximum aggregate number of shares subject to Options granted in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be 2,500,000.
(b)        Stock Appreciation Rights: The maximum number of shares subject to Stock Appreciation Rights granted in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be 2,500,000.
(c)        Performance Shares or Performance Units: The maximum aggregate grant with respect to Performance Shares or Performance Units that a Participant may receive in any one calendar year shall be 1,500,000 shares, or equal to the value of 1,500,000 shares (as of the time of settlement) if settled in cash.
(d)        Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units: The maximum aggregate grant with respect to Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be 1,500,000 shares, or equal to the value of 1,500,000 shares (as of the time of settlement) if settled in cash.
(e)        Incentive Awards: The maximum aggregate amount awarded or credited in any one calendar year with respect to an Incentive Award to any one Participant shall be $10,000,000.
(f)        Cash Awards: The maximum aggregate amount awarded to or credited with respect to Cash Awards to any one Participant in any one calendar year may not exceed the greater of $10,000,000 dollars or the value of 1,500,000 shares.
(g)        Other Stock-Based Awards: The maximum aggregate grant with respect to Other Stock-Based Awards in any one calendar year to any one Participant shall be 1,500,000 shares.
 
(a)        In the event of a Change in Capitalization that is not also a Change of Control, the Plan Administrator shall make such adjustments, if any, as it determines are appropriate and equitable, and to the extent such an action does not conflict with Delaware or other applicable laws or securities exchange rules, to (i) the maximum number and class of shares of Common Stock or other stock or securities with respect to which Awards may be granted under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number and class of shares of Common Stock or other stock or securities that may be issued upon exercise of Nonqualified Options, Incentive Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, (iii) the Maximum Grants, (iv) the number and class of shares of Common Stock or other stock or securities which are subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan and the Option Price or exercise price therefore, if applicable and (v) the Performance Goals; provided, however, that in the case of an "equity restructuring" (within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards No. Update Topic 718), the Board shall make an equitable or appropriate adjustment to outstanding Awards to reflect such equity restructuring. Any such adjustment shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons claiming any right or interest under the Plan.
 
(b)        Any such adjustment in the shares of Common Stock or other stock or securities (i) subject to outstanding Incentive Stock Options (including any adjustments in the exercise price) shall be made in such manner as not to constitute a modification as defined by Section 424(h)(3) of the Code and only to the extent otherwise permitted by Sections 422 and 424 of the Code or (ii) subject to outstanding Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) shall be made in such a manner as not to adversely affect the treatment of the Awards as performance-based compensation.
(c)        If, by reason of a Change in Capitalization that is not also a Change of Control, a Participant shall be entitled to, or shall be entitled to exercise an Option or Stock Appreciation Right with respect to, new, additional or different shares of stock or securities of the Company or any other corporation, such new, additional or different shares shall thereupon be subject to all of the conditions, restrictions and performance criteria which were applicable to the shares of Common Stock that such shares replaced or to the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as the case may be, prior to such Change in Capitalization.
(d)        No adjustments made under this Section 5 shall be made with respect to a Participant's Award if such adjustment would result in adverse taxation to such Participant under Section 409A.
 
Following (a) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (b) a merger or consolidation of the Company (a "Transaction"), (i) each outstanding Award shall be treated as provided for in the agreement entered into in connection with the Transaction (which treatment may be different as among different types of Awards and different holders thereof) or (ii) if not so provided in such agreement, each Participant shall be entitled to receive in respect of each share of Common Stock subject to any outstanding Awards, upon exercise of any Option or Stock Appreciation Right or payment or transfer in respect of any other Award, the same number and kind of stock, securities, cash, property or other consideration that each holder of a share of Common Stock was entitled to receive in the Transaction in respect of a share of Common Stock; provided, however, that such stock, securities, cash, property, or other consideration shall remain subject to all of the conditions, restrictions and performance criteria which were applicable to Awards prior to such Transaction, but giving effect to any applicable provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement if the Transaction is a Change of Control. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the treatment of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5.4 in connection with a Transaction in which the consideration paid or distributed to the Company's stockholders is not entirely shares of common stock of the acquiring or resulting corporation may include the cancellation of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights upon consummation of the Transaction provided either (x) the holders of affected Options and Stock Appreciation rights have been given a period of at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the consummation of the Transaction to exercise the Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (whether or not they were otherwise exercisable) or (y) the holders of the affected Options and Stock Appreciation Rights are paid (in cash or cash equivalents) in respect of each share of Common Stock covered by the Options or Stock Appreciation Rights being cancelled an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the per share price
 
paid or distributed to stockholders in the Transaction (the value of any non-cash consideration to be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion) over the exercise price thereof. For avoidance of doubt, (1) the cancellation of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence may be effected notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan or any Award Agreement and (2) if the amount determined pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence is zero or less, the affected Options and Stock Appreciation Rights may be cancelled without any payment therefore. The treatment of any Award as provided in this Section 5.4 shall be conclusively presumed to be appropriate for purposes of Section 5.3.
Upon a determination by the Plan Administrator that an Award is to be granted to a Participant pursuant to Section 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 of this Plan, an Award Agreement shall be provided to such Participant as soon as practicable specifying, without limitation, the terms, conditions, rights and duties related thereto, including terms requiring forfeiture of Awards in the event of a Termination of Service by the Participant and terms relating to the Clawback/Forfeiture Events under Section 18.1 of this Plan. Each Award Agreement shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Options may be granted to eligible Participants in such number, and at such times during the term of the Plan as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The Plan Administrator may grant an Option or provide for the grant of an Option, either from time to time in the discretion of the Plan Administrator or automatically upon the occurrence of specified events, including, without limitation, the achievement of Performance Goals or other performance measures, the satisfaction of an event or condition within the control of the recipient of the Option or within the control of others. The granting of an Option shall take place when the Plan Administrator by resolution, written consent or other appropriate action determines to grant such an Option to a particular Participant at the Option Price. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be identified in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Option (or if no such identification is made, then it shall be a Nonqualified Option). No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any Participant who is not an Employee of the Company or any "subsidiary corporation" of the Company (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code).
 
Each provision of the Plan and each Incentive Stock Option granted thereunder shall be construed so that each such Option shall qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, and any provision thereof that cannot be so construed shall be disregarded, unless the Employee agrees otherwise. Incentive Stock Options, in addition to complying with the other provisions of the Plan relating to Options generally, shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
(a)        
Ten Percent (10%) Stockholders
An Employee must not, immediately before an Incentive Stock Option is granted to him or her, own stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of a Subsidiary. This requirement is waived if (i) the Option Price of the Incentive Stock Option to be granted is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the stock subject to the Option, determined at the time the Option is granted, and (ii) the Option is not exercisable more than five (5) years from the date the Option is granted.
(b)        
Annual Limitation
To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of the grant of the option) of the stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Employee during any calendar year exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Options. In applying the limitation in the preceding sentence in the case of multiple Option grants, unless otherwise required by applicable law, Options which were intended to be Incentive Stock Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Options according to the order in which they were granted such that the most recently granted Options are first treated as Nonqualified Options.
(c)        
Additional Terms
Any other terms and conditions which the Plan Administrator determines, upon advice of counsel, must be imposed for the Option to be an Incentive Stock Option.
(d)        
Notice of Disqualifying Disposition
If an Employee shall make any disposition of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to an Incentive Stock Option under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to disqualifying distributions), the Employee shall notify the Company of such disposition within twenty (20) days thereof.
 
Except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement and Section 7.2 of this Plan, all Incentive Stock Options and Nonqualified Options under the Plan shall be granted subject to the following terms and conditions:
(a)        
Option Price
 
The Option Price shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in any reasonable manner, but shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Option is granted, except in the case of Options that are granted in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by (i) a company acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary, or (ii) a company with which the Company or a Subsidiary combines.
(b)        
Duration of Options
Options shall be exercisable at such time and under such conditions as set forth in the Award Agreement, but in no event shall any Option (whether a Nonqualified Option or an Incentive Stock Option) be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of its grant.
(c)        
Exercise of Options
Common Stock covered by an Option may be purchased at one time or in such installments over the option period as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Any Common Stock not purchased on an applicable installment date may be purchased thereafter at any time prior to the expiration of the Option in accordance with its terms. To the extent that the right to purchase Common Stock has accrued thereunder, an Option may be exercised from time to time by notice to the Company setting forth the amount of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is being exercised.
(d)        
Payment
The purchase price of Common Stock purchased under Options shall be paid in full to the Company upon the exercise of the Option by delivery of consideration equal to the product of the Option Price and the Common Stock purchased (the "Purchase Price"). Such consideration may be either (i) in cash or (ii) at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, in Common Stock (by either actual delivery of Common Stock or by attestation presenting satisfactory proof of beneficial ownership of such Common Stock) already owned by the Participant, or any combination of cash and Common Stock. The Fair Market Value of such Common Stock as delivered shall be valued as of the day of exercise. The Plan Administrator can determine that additional forms of payment will be permitted. To the extent permitted by the Plan Administrator and applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, federal tax and securities laws, regulations and state corporate law), an Option may also be exercised in a "cashless" exercise by delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to promptly deliver to the Company sufficient proceeds to pay the Purchase Price. A Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder until the Common Stock is issued to the Participant.
The Plan Administrator may permit a Participant to pay all or a portion of the Purchase Price by having Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to all or a portion of the Purchase Price be withheld from the shares issuable to the Participant upon the exercise of the Option. The Fair Market Value of such Common Stock as is withheld shall be determined as of the same day as the exercise of the Option.
 
(e)        
Restrictions
The Plan Administrator shall determine and reflect in the Award Agreement, with respect to each Option, the nature and extent of the restrictions, if any, to be imposed on the Common Stock which may be purchased thereunder, including, without limitation, restrictions on the transferability of such Common Stock acquired through the exercise of such Options for such periods as the Plan Administrator may determine. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, the Plan Administrator may require that a Participant who wants to effectuate a "cashless" exercise of Options be required to sell the Common Stock acquired in the associated exercise to the Company, or in the open market through the use of a broker selected by the Company, at such price and on such terms as the Plan Administrator may determine at the time of grant, or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Common Stock issued as a result of the exercise of an Option, including without limitation (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by one or more Participants and (iii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers.
(f)        
Transferability of Options
Notwithstanding Section 18.2 and only if allowed by the Plan Administrator in its discretion, Nonqualified Options may be transferred to a Participant's immediate family members, directly or indirectly or by means of a trust, corporate entity or partnership (a person who thus acquires this option by such transfer, a "Permitted Transferee"). A transfer of a Nonqualified Option may only be effected by the Company at the request of the Participant and shall become effective upon the Permitted Transferee agreeing to such terms as the Plan Administrator may require and only when recorded in the Company's record of outstanding Options. In the event an Option is transferred as contemplated hereby, the Option may not be subsequently transferred by the Permitted Transferee except a transfer back to the Participant or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. A transferred Option may be exercised by a Permitted Transferee to the same extent as, and subject to the same terms and conditions as, the Participant (except as otherwise provided herein), as if no transfer had taken place. As used herein, "immediate family member" shall mean, with respect to any person, such person's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and shall include adoptive relationships. In the event of exercise of a transferred Option by a Permitted Transferee, any amounts due to (or to be withheld by) the Company upon exercise of the Option shall be delivered by (or withheld from amounts due to) the Participant, the Participant's estate or the Permitted Transferee, in the reasonable discretion of the Company.
In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and Rule 16b-3, the Plan Administrator may permit a recipient of a Nonqualified Option to designate in writing during the Participant's lifetime a Beneficiary to receive and exercise the Participant's Nonqualified Options in the event of such Participant's death.
 
(g)        
Purchase for Investment
The Plan Administrator shall have the right to require that each Participant or other person who shall exercise an Option under the Plan, and each person into whose name the Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option, represent and agree that any and all Common Stock purchased pursuant to such Option is being purchased for investment only and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof and that such Common Stock will not be sold except in accordance with such restrictions or limitations as may be set forth in the Option or by the Plan Administrator. This Section 7.3(g) shall be inoperative during any period of time when the Company has obtained all necessary or advisable approvals from governmental agencies and has completed all necessary or advisable registrations or other qualifications of the Common Stock as to which Options may from time to time be granted as contemplated in Section 17.
(h)        
No Repricing or Exchange
Except as provided in the Plan or upon approval of the Company's stockholders, the Options granted under this Plan shall not be repriced. In particular, the Plan Administrator may not take any action (i) to amend the terms of an outstanding Option to reduce the Option Price thereof, cancel an Option and replace it with a new Option with a lower Option Price, or that has an economic effect that is the same as any such reduction or cancellation or (ii) to cancel an outstanding Option having an Option Price above the then-current Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in exchange for the grant of another type of Award, without, in each such case, first obtaining approval of the Company's stockholders of such action.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants in such number, and at such times during the term of the Plan as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The Plan Administrator may grant a Stock Appreciation Right or provide for the grant of a Stock Appreciation Right, either from time to time in the discretion of the Plan Administrator or automatically upon the occurrence of specified events, including, without limitation, the achievement of Performance Goals or other performance measures, the satisfaction of an event or condition within the control of the recipient of the Stock Appreciation Right or within the control of others. The granting of a Stock Appreciation Right shall take place when the Plan Administrator by resolution, written consent or other appropriate action determines to grant such a Stock Appreciation Right to a particular Participant at a particular price. A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted freestanding or in tandem or in combination with any other Award under the Plan.
 
A Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised upon such terms and conditions and for such term as the Plan Administrator shall determine; provided, however, no Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of its grant. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, a Participant shall be entitled to receive Common Stock, or the cash equivalent, with an aggregate Fair Market Value determined by multiplying (i) the difference between the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right over the price determined by the Plan Administrator on the date of grant (which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, except in the case of Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by (x) a company acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary, or (y) a company with which the Company or a Subsidiary combines) times (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised. The value of any fractional shares shall be paid in cash.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights are subject to the following restrictions:
(a)        A Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with any other Award under the Plan shall be exercisable at such time or times as the Award to which it relates shall be exercisable, or at such other times as the Plan Administrator may determine.
(b)        The right of a Participant to exercise a Stock Appreciation Right granted in tandem with any other Award under the Plan shall be canceled if and to the extent the related Award is exercised or canceled. To the extent that a Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, the related Award shall be deemed to have been surrendered unexercised and canceled.
(c)        A holder of Stock Appreciation Rights shall have none of the rights of a stockholder until the Common Stock, if any, is issued to such holder pursuant to such holder's exercise of such rights.
(d)        The acquisition of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be subject to the same restrictions as would apply to the acquisition of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an Option, as set forth in Section 7.3.
 
Except as provided in the Plan or upon approval of the Company's stockholders, the Stock Appreciation Rights granted under this Plan shall not be repriced. In particular, the Plan Administrator may not take any action (i) to amend the terms of an outstanding Stock Appreciation Right to reduce the grant price thereof, cancel a Stock Appreciation Right and replace it with a new Stock Appreciation Right with a lower grant price, or that has an economic
 
effect that is the same as any such reduction or cancellation or (ii) to cancel an outstanding Stock Appreciation Right having a grant price above the then-current Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in exchange for the grant of another type of Award, without, in each such case, first obtaining approval of the Company's stockholders of such action.
 
Subject to the limitations in Section 5.2, Performance Shares or Performance Units may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The Plan Administrator shall have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Shares or Performance Units granted to each Participant and the terms and conditions thereof. Performance Shares and Performance Units may be granted alone or in combination with any other Award under the Plan.
 
The Plan Administrator shall establish Performance Goals for any specified Performance Periods. In no event shall a Performance Period be less than one (1) year with respect to grants of Performance Shares or Performance Units. Prior to each grant of Performance Shares or Performance Units, the Plan Administrator shall establish an initial amount of Common Stock for each Performance Share and an initial value for each Performance Unit granted to each Participant for that Performance Period. Prior to each grant of Performance Shares or Performance Units, the Plan Administrator also shall set the Performance Goals that will be used to determine the extent to which the Participant receives Common Stock for the Performance Shares or payment of the value of the Performance Units awarded for such Performance Period. With respect to each such Performance Goal utilized during a Performance Period, the Plan Administrator may assign percentages or other relative values to various levels of performance which shall be applied to determine the extent to which the Participant shall receive a payout of the number of Performance Shares or value of Performance Units awarded.
 
After a Performance Period has ended, the holder of a Performance Share or Performance Unit shall be entitled to receive the value thereof as determined by the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall make this determination by first determining the extent to which the Performance Goals set pursuant to Section 9.2 have been met. The Plan Administrator shall then determine the applicable percentage or other relative value to be applied to, and will apply such percentage or other relative value to, the number of Performance Shares or value of Performance Units to determine the payout to be received by the Participant. In addition, with respect to Performance Shares and Performance Units granted to each Participant, no payout shall be made hereunder except upon written certification by the Plan Administrator that the applicable Performance Goals have been satisfied to a particular extent.
 
The payment described in Section 9.3 shall be made in Common Stock, or in cash, or partly in Common Stock and partly in cash, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. The value of any fractional shares shall be paid in cash. Payment shall be made in a lump sum or installments as prescribed by the Plan Administrator or the Award Agreement, as applicable, and consistent with Section 409A. If Common Stock is to be converted into an amount of cash on any date, or if an amount of cash is to be converted into Common Stock on any date, such conversion shall be done at the then-current Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on such date.
 
The Plan Administrator may provide that Performance Shares or Performance Units awarded under the Plan shall be entitled to an amount per Performance Share or Performance Unit equal in value to the cash dividend, if any, paid per share of Common Stock on issued and outstanding shares, on the dividend payment dates ("Dividend Payment Date") occurring during the period between the date on which the Performance Shares or Performances Unit are granted to the Participant and the date on which such Performance Shares or Performance Units are settled, cancelled, forfeited, waived, surrendered or terminated under the Plan. Such paid amounts called "dividend equivalents" shall be accrued and paid in cash and/or Common Stock (including reinvestment in additional shares of Common Stock) and paid at such time as the Performance Share or Performance Unit to which it relates vests and settles as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued and/or reinvested shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value on the Dividend Payment Date. In the event the dividend equivalents are deferred, they shall be payable in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.
 
Subject to the limitations in Section 5.2, Restricted Stock may be granted to Participants in such number and at such times during the term of the Plan as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The Plan Administrator may grant Restricted Stock or provide for the grant of Restricted Stock, either from time to time in the discretion of the Plan Administrator or automatically upon the occurrence of specified events.
 
Except as permitted by the Plan Administrator and specified in the Award Agreement, during a period following the date of grant, as determined by the Plan Administrator, which in no event shall be less than three (3) years with respect to Restricted Stock subject to restrictions
 
based upon time and one (1) year with respect to Restricted Stock subject to restrictions based upon the achievement of specific Performance Goals or other performance measures (the "Restriction Period") the Restricted Stock shall be subject to Section 18.2. During the Restriction Period, the Plan Administrator shall evidence the restrictions on the shares of Restricted Stock in such a manner as it determines is appropriate (including, without limitation, (i) by means of appropriate legends on shares of Restricted Stock that have been certificated and (ii) by means of appropriate stop-transfer orders on shares of Restricted Stock credited to book-entry accounts).
 
The Plan Administrator shall impose such other restrictions on Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan as it may deem advisable, including Performance Goals or other performance measures. The Plan Administrator may require, under such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate or desirable, that the certificates for Restricted Stock delivered under the Plan may be held in custody by a bank or other institution, or that the Company may itself hold such shares in custody until the Restriction Period expires or until restrictions thereon otherwise lapse, and may require, as a condition of any issuance of Restricted Stock that the Participant shall have delivered a stock power endorsed in blank relating to the shares of Restricted Stock.
 
A Participant receiving a grant of Restricted Stock shall be recorded as a stockholder of the Company. Except as otherwise provided under the terms of the Plan or an Award Agreement, a Participant who receives a grant of Restricted Stock shall have the rights of a stockholder with respect to such shares (except as provided in the restrictions on transferability), including the right to vote the shares and receive dividends and other distributions paid with respect to the underlying shares of Common Stock. The Plan Administrator may require that any cash dividend paid on a share of Common Stock subject to the Restricted Stock be (i) paid in cash on or about the Dividend Payment Date or accrued and paid at such time as the Restricted Stock to which it relates vests and settles, (ii) paid in Common Stock on or about the Dividend Payment Date or accrued and/or reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock and paid at such time as the Restricted Stock to which it relates vests and settles, or (iii) paid in any combination thereof of cash or Common Stock and paid at such times as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued and/or reinvested shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value on the Dividend Payment Date. In the event the dividends are deferred, they shall be payable in accordance with the requirements of 409A.
 
When the restrictions imposed by Section 10.2 expire or otherwise lapse with respect to one or more shares of Restricted Stock, the Participant shall be obligated to return to the Company any certificate(s) representing shares of Restricted Stock (if applicable), and the Company shall deliver to the Participant one (1) share of Common Stock (which may be delivered in book-entry or certificated form) in satisfaction of each share of Restricted Stock, which shares so delivered shall not contain any legend. The delivery of shares pursuant to this
 
Section 10.5 shall be subject to any required share withholding to satisfy tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 18.10. Any fractional shares subject to such Restricted Stock shall be paid to the Participant in cash.
 
Subject to the limitations in Section 5.2, Restricted Stock Units may be granted to Participants in such number and at such times during the term of the Plan as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The Plan Administrator may grant Restricted Stock Units or provide for the grant of Restricted Stock Units, either from time to time in the discretion of the Plan Administrator or automatically upon the occurrence of specified events.
 
Except as permitted by the Plan Administrator and specified in the Award Agreement, during a period following the date of grant, as determined by the Plan Administrator, which in no event shall be less than three (3) years with respect to Restricted Stock Units subject to restrictions based upon time and one (1) year with respect to Restricted Stock Units subject to restrictions based upon the achievement of specific Performance Goals or other performance measures (the "Restriction Period") the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to Section 18.2.
 
The Plan Administrator shall impose such other restrictions on Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to the Plan as it may deem advisable, including the requirement that certain pre-established Performance Goals be met. A Participant receiving a grant of Restricted Stock Units shall not be recorded as a stockholder of the Company and shall not acquire any rights of a stockholder unless or until the Participant is issued shares of Common Stock in settlement of such Restricted Stock Units.
 
The Plan Administrator may provide that Restricted Stock Units awarded under the Plan shall be entitled to an amount per Restricted Stock Unit equal in value to the cash dividend, if any, paid per share of Common Stock on issued and outstanding shares, on the Dividend Payment Dates occurring during the period between the date on which the Restricted Stock Units are granted to the Participant and the date on which such Restricted Stock Units are settled, cancelled, forfeited, waived, surrendered or terminated under the Plan. Such paid amounts called "dividend equivalents" shall be (i) paid in cash on or about the Dividend Payment Date or accrued and paid at such time as the Restricted Stock Unit to which it relates vests and settles, (ii) paid in Common Stock on or about the Dividend Payment Date or accrued and/or reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock and paid at such time as the Restricted Stock Units to
 
which it relates vests and settles, or (iii) paid in any combination thereof of cash or Common Stock and paid at such times as the Plan Administrator shall determine. The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued and/or reinvested shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value on the Dividend Payment Date. In the event the dividend equivalents are deferred, they shall be payable in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A.
 
When the restrictions imposed by Section 11.2 expire or otherwise lapse with respect to one or more Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock Units shall be settled (i) in cash or (ii) by the delivery to the Participant of the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of the Participant's Restricted Stock Units that are vested, or any combination thereof, as the Plan Administrator shall determine and in accordance with Section 409A. The delivery of shares pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be subject to any required share withholding to satisfy tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 18.10. Any fractional shares subject to such Restricted Stock Units shall be paid to the Participant in cash.
 
Prior to the beginning of each Performance Period, or not later than ninety (90) days following the commencement of the relevant fiscal year (or such other time as may be required or permitted for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), if applicable), the Plan Administrator shall establish Performance Goals or other performance measures which must be achieved for any Participant to receive an Incentive Award for that Performance Period. The Performance Goals or other performance measures may be based on any combination of corporate and business unit Performance Goals or other performance measures. The Plan Administrator may also establish one or more Company-wide Performance Goals or other performance measures which must be achieved for any Participant to receive an Incentive Award for that Performance Period. Such Performance Goals or other performance measures may include a threshold level of performance below which no Incentive Award shall be earned, target levels of performance at which specific Incentive Awards will be earned, and a maximum level of performance at which the maximum level of Incentive Awards will be earned. Each Incentive Award shall specify the amount of cash and the amount of any other Awards subject to such Incentive Award.
 
An Incentive Award shall become payable to the extent provided herein in the event that the Plan Administrator certifies in writing prior to payment of the Incentive Award that the Performance Goals or other performance measures selected for a particular Performance Period have been attained. In no event will an Incentive Award be payable under this Plan if the threshold level of performance set for each Performance Goal or other performance measure for the applicable Performance Period is not attained.
 
The Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion and only prior to a Change of Control, may reduce the amount of any Incentive Award otherwise payable to a Participant upon attainment of any Performance Goal or other performance measure for the applicable Performance Period. A Participant's individual performance must be satisfactory as determined by the Plan Administrator, regardless of the Company's performance and the attainment of Performance Goals or other performance measures, before he or she may be paid an Incentive Award. In evaluating a Participant's performance, the Plan Administrator shall consider the Performance Goals or other performance measures, the Participant's responsibilities and accomplishments, and such other factors as it deems appropriate.
 
The Plan Administrator shall make a determination as soon as administratively possible after the information that is necessary to make such a determination is available for a particular Performance Period whether the Performance Goals or other performance measures for the Performance Period have been achieved, the amount of the Incentive Award for each Participant and whether the Incentive Award shall be paid in cash and/or other Awards under the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall certify the foregoing determinations in writing as provided in Section 2.30. In the absence of an election by the Participant pursuant to Section 14, the Incentive Award shall be paid as soon as practicable after the end of the calendar year, but in no event later than March 15 following the end of the calendar year in which the foregoing determinations have been made.
 
Subject to the terms and provisions of this Plan, the Plan Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant cash awards to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms, including the achievement of Performance Goals or other specific performance measures, as the Plan Administrator may determine (each, a "Cash Award").
 
The Plan Administrator may grant other types of equity-based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms of this Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted shares of Common Stock, Awards in lieu of obligations to pay cash or deliver other property, or Common Stock) in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Plan Administrator shall determine (each, an "Other Stock-Based Award"). Such Other Stock-
 
Based Awards may involve the transfer of Common Stock to Participants, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on or valued in whole or in part by reference to the value of Common Stock.
 
Each Cash Award granted pursuant to this Section 13 shall specify a payment amount or payment range as determined by the Plan Administrator. Each Other Stock-Based Award shall be expressed in terms of Common Stock or units based on Common Stock, as determined by the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may establish performance measures applicable to such Awards in its discretion. If the Plan Administrator exercises its discretion to establish performance measures, the number and/or value of such cash awards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid out to the Participant will depend on the extent to which the performance measures are met.
 
Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash Award or an Other Stock-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, in cash or Common Stock as the Plan Administrator determines and in accordance with Section 409A so as not to be treated as payment made pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The value of any fractional shares shall be paid in cash.
The Plan Administrator may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, permit Employees to defer Awards under the Plan. Any such deferrals shall be subject to such terms, conditions and procedures that the Company may establish from time to time in its sole discretion and consistent with the advance and subsequent deferral election requirements of Section 409A.
The Award Agreement applicable to each Award shall set forth the effect of a Termination of Service upon such Award; provided, however, that, unless explicitly set forth otherwise in an Award Agreement or as determined by the Plan Administrator, (i) all of a Participant's unvested and/or unexercisable Awards shall automatically be forfeited upon a Termination of Service for any reason, and, as to Awards consisting of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, the Participant shall be permitted to exercise the vested portion of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right for at least three months following termination of his or her employment, and (ii) all of a Participant's Awards (whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable) shall automatically be forfeited upon termination of the Participant's employment for Cause. Provisions relating to the effect of a Termination of Service upon an Award shall be
 
determined in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator and need not be uniform among all Awards or among all Participants. Unless the Plan Administrator determines otherwise in accordance with Section 409A, the transfer of employment of a Participant as between the Company and a Subsidiary shall not constitute a Termination of Service. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to determine the effect, if any, that a sale or other disposition of an Employer will have on the Participant's Awards.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary and unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of a Change of Control:
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this Section 16 and unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, the term "Applicable Period" shall have the following meaning: (i) to the extent provided in an Employee's employment agreement, severance or other individual agreement, the term "Applicable Period" shall mean the protection period following a Change of Control provided in the such agreement with respect to such Employee, (ii) in the case of an Employee covered by the Company's Key Employee Change-of-Control Contract, the term "Applicable Period" shall mean the protection period following a Change of Control provided in the Key Employee Change-of-Control Contract entered into with such Employee, (iii) in the case of an Employee covered by the Company's Key Manager Change-of-Control Agreement, the term "Applicable Period" shall mean the protection period following a Change of Control provided in the Key
 
Manager Change-of-Control Agreement entered into with such Employee; and (iv) in the case of any Employee not covered by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the term "Applicable Period" shall mean the protection period following a Change of Control provided in the Company's Employee Change-of-Control Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.
In addition to the Plan Administrator's authority set forth in Sections 5.3, in order to maintain the Participants' rights in the event of any Change of Control, the Plan Administrator, as constituted before such Change of Control, is hereby authorized, and has sole discretion, as to any Award, either at the time such Award is made hereunder or any time thereafter, to take any one or more of the following actions: (i) provide for the purchase of any such Award for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights had such Award been currently exercisable or payable, as long as such purchase does not result in taxation to the Participant under Section 409A; or (ii) cause any such Award then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the acquiring or surviving corporation after such Change of Control. The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, include such further provisions and limitations in any Award Agreement, as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company.
The Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or create a book-entry account for shares of Common Stock under the Plan prior to:
(a)        obtaining any approval or ruling from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency which the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be necessary or advisable;
(b)        listing of such shares on any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed; and
(c)        completing any registration or other qualification of such shares under any federal or state laws, rulings or regulations of any governmental body which the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be necessary or advisable.
All certificates, or book-entry accounts, for shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall also be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Plan Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which Common Stock is then listed and any applicable federal or state securities laws, and the Plan Administrator may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates, or notations on such book-entry accounts, to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. The foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not be effective if and to the extent that the shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan are covered by an effective and current registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or if and so long as the Plan Administrator determines that application
 
of such provisions are no longer required or desirable. In making such determination, the Plan Administrator may rely upon an opinion of counsel for the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the Plan Administrator may impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by a Participant of any shares of Common Stock issued under this Plan, including without limitation (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by one or more Participants and (iii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers.
 
(a)        If required by Company policy, by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and/or by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or other applicable laws, each Participant's Award shall be conditioned on repayment or forfeiture in accordance with such applicable laws, Company policy, and any relevant provisions in the related Award Agreement.
(b)        The Plan Administrator may specify in an Award Agreement or otherwise that a Participant's rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, without limitation, termination of employment for Cause, violation of material policies that may apply to the Participant, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company or a Subsidiary.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the Plan and permitted by law, including but not limited to the Code, the right of a Participant or Beneficiary to the payment of any Award granted under the Plan and the rights and privileges conferred thereby shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process and may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any manner (whether by operation of law or otherwise) other than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution unless the Participant has received the Plan Administrator's prior written consent. Except as otherwise provided for under the Plan, if any Participant attempts to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any Award under the Plan or of any right or privilege conferred thereby, contrary to the provisions of the Plan or such Award, or suffers the sale or levy or any attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred hereby, all affected Awards held by such Participant shall be immediately forfeited.
 
Nothing contained in the Plan, or in any Award granted pursuant to the Plan, shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or as a Consultant for, the Company or a Subsidiary, nor interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment or service of such Participant at any time with or without assigning any reason therefor, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Participant and the Company or any Employer.
 
Unless determined otherwise by the Plan Administrator or required by contractual obligations, the grant, vesting or payment of Awards under the Plan shall not be considered as part of an Employee's salary or used for the calculation of any other pay, allowance, pension or other benefit unless otherwise permitted by other benefit plans provided by the Company or a Subsidiary, or required by law or by contractual obligations of the Company or a Subsidiary.
 
Leaves of absence for such periods and purposes conforming to the personnel policy of the Company, or of a Subsidiary, as applicable, shall not be deemed a Termination of Service, unless a Participant commences a leave of absence from which he or she is not expected to return to active employment or service with the Company or a Subsidiary. The foregoing notwithstanding, with respect to Incentive Stock Options, employment shall not be deemed to continue beyond the first ninety (90) days of such leave unless the Participant's reemployment rights are guaranteed by statute or contract. With respect to any Participant who, after the date an Award is granted under this Plan, ceases to be employed by or provide services to the Company or a Subsidiary on a full-time basis but continues to be employed or provide services on a part-time basis, the Plan Administrator may make appropriate adjustments, as determined in its sole discretion, as to the number of shares issuable under, the vesting schedule of, or the amount payable under any unvested Awards held by such Participant.
 
In the event a Participant is transferred from the Company to a Subsidiary, or vice versa, or is promoted or given different responsibilities, Awards granted to the Participant prior to such date shall not be affected.
 
Any amounts (deferred or otherwise) to be paid to Participants pursuant to the Plan are unfunded obligations. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is required to segregate any monies from its general funds, to create any trusts or to make any special deposits with respect to this obligation. The Plan Administrator, in its sole discretion, may direct the Company to share with a Subsidiary the costs of a portion of the Incentive Awards paid to Participants who are
 
executives of those companies. Beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments which the Company may make to fulfill this obligation, shall at all times remain in the Company. Any investments and the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account shall not create or constitute a trust or a fiduciary relationship between the Plan Administrator, the Company or any Subsidiary and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary or the Participant's creditors in any assets of the Company or a Subsidiary whatsoever. The Participants shall have no claim against the Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.
 
The designation of a Beneficiary shall be on a form provided by the Company, executed by the Participant (with the consent of the Participant's spouse, if required by the Company for reasons of community property or otherwise), and delivered to a designated representative of the Company. The Company may, in its discretion, utilize an electronic process for Beneficiary designations. A Participant may change his or her Beneficiary designation at any time. A designation by a Participant under any predecessor plans shall remain in effect under the Plan unless such designation is revoked or changed under the Plan. In the event that a Participant becomes divorced, a Beneficiary designation under this Plan or a predecessor plan in favor of his or her divorced spouse shall become void as of the effective date of the divorce, unless the Participant re-designates the former spouse as his or her Beneficiary following the effective date of the divorce. If no Beneficiary is designated, if the designation is ineffective, or if the Beneficiary dies before the balance of a Participant's benefit is paid, the balance shall be paid to the Participant's spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, to the Participant's estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, a Participant's Beneficiary shall be determined under applicable state law if such state law does not recognize Beneficiary designations under plans of this sort and is not preempted by laws which recognize the provisions of this Section 18.8. In the event that the Plan Administrator determines that two or more claims are made by claimed Beneficiaries against the Plan for an Award, the Plan Administrator may initiate an interpleader action in a court of competent jurisdiction to resolve the controversy.
In the event that an Award has vested, its restrictions have lapsed, or it has been exercised and the underlying shares of Common Stock relating to such award have been transferred to a brokerage account, it is the responsibility of the Participant to establish and maintain beneficiary designations with that broker.
 
The Plan shall be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.
 
18.10 Satisfaction of Tax Obligations
Appropriate provision shall be made for all taxes required to be withheld in connection with the exercise, grant, vesting or other taxable event of Awards under the applicable laws and regulations of any governmental authority, whether federal, state or local and whether domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the required withholding of a sufficient amount of Common Stock otherwise issuable to an Employee to satisfy the said required minimum tax withholding obligations. To the extent provided by the Plan Administrator, an Employee is permitted to deliver Common Stock (including shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right other than the Option or Stock Appreciation Right currently being exercised, to the extent permitted by applicable regulations) for payment of withholding taxes on the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, upon the grant or vesting of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units or upon the payout of Performance Shares, Performance Units or Incentive Awards. Common Stock may be required to be withheld from the shares issuable to the Employee upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, upon the vesting of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units or upon the payout of Performance Shares or Performance Units to satisfy such minimum required tax withholding obligations. The Fair Market Value of Common Stock as delivered pursuant to this Section 18.10 shall be determined as of the day of release, and shall be calculated in accordance with Section 2.18.
Any Participant who makes a Section 83(b) election under the Code shall, within ten (10) days of making such election, notify the Company in writing of such election and shall provide the Company or such Participant's Employer with a copy of such election form filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
A Participant is solely responsible for obtaining, or failing to obtain, tax advice with respect to participation in the Plan prior to the Participant's (i) entering into any transaction under or with respect to the Plan, (ii) designating or choosing the times of distributions under the Plan, or (iii) disposing of any Common Stock issued under the Plan.
18.11 Participants in Foreign Jurisdictions
The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of any countries in which the Company or any Subsidiary may operate to ensure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants employed in such countries, to meet the requirements of local laws that permit the Plan to operate in a qualified or tax-efficient manner, to comply with applicable foreign laws and to meet the objectives of the Plan; provided, however, that no such action taken pursuant to this Section 18.11 shall result in a "material revision" of the Plan under applicable securities exchange governance rules.
 
 
The Company's intention is that, so long as any of the Company's equity securities are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, the Plan shall comply in all respects with the rules of any exchange on which the Common Stock is traded and with Rule 16b-3. In addition, it is the Company's intention that, as to Covered Employees, unless otherwise indicated in an Award Agreement, Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares, Performance Units and Incentive Awards shall be designed to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). If any Plan provision is determined not to be in compliance with the foregoing intentions, that provision shall be deemed modified as necessary to meet the requirements of any such exchange, Rule 16b-3 and Section 162(m).
 
The Plan is intended to be administered, operated and construed in compliance with Section 409A and any guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding this or any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Board or the Plan Administrator may amend the Plan in any manner, or take any other action, that either of them determines, in its sole discretion, is necessary, appropriate or advisable to cause the Plan to comply with Section 409A and any guidance issued thereunder. Any such action, once taken, shall be deemed to be effective from the earliest date necessary and applicable to avoid a violation of Section 409A and shall be final, binding and conclusive on all Employees and other individuals having or claiming any right or interest under the Plan.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement, if a Participant is a "specified employee" upon his or her "separation from service" (within the meaning of such terms in Section 409A under such definitions and procedures as established by the Company in accordance with Section 409A), any portion of a payment, settlement or other distribution made upon such a "separation from service" that would cause the acceleration of, or an addition to, any taxes pursuant to Section 409A will not commence or be paid until a date that is six (6) months and one (1) day following the applicable "separation from service." Any payments, settlements or other distributions that are delayed pursuant to this Section 19.2 following the applicable "separation from service" shall be accumulated and paid to the Participant in a lump sum without interest on the first business day immediately following the required delay period.
The Plan was adopted by the Board on February 16, 2012, and is subject to approval by the Company's stockholders. If approved by the stockholders, this Plan will replace the Prior Plan, and no further Awards will be made under the Prior Plan. This Plan shall become effective
 
on the Effective Date, and shall remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board to terminate the Plan at any time pursuant to Section 21, until all Common Stock subject to it shall have been purchased or acquired according to the provisions herein. However, in no event may an Award be granted under the Plan on or after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Date. After this Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted pursuant to the Plan, but Awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and this Plan's terms and conditions.
 
Subject to approval of the Board with respect to amendments that are required by law or regulation or stock exchange rules to be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may from time to time make such amendments to the Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interest of the Company, including, without limitation, any amendment necessary to ensure that the Company may obtain any regulatory approval referred to in Section 16; provided, however, that (i) to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, stockholder approval shall be required, and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the Plan, no change in any Award previously granted under the Plan may be made without the consent of the Participant if such change would impair the right of the Participant under the Award to acquire or retain Common Stock or cash that the Participant may have acquired as a result of the Plan.
 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee may at any time suspend the operation of or terminate the Plan with respect to any Common Stock or rights which are not at that time subject to any Award outstanding under the Plan.
 
If so determined by the Plan Administrator, the provisions of the Plan relating to Performance Goals and Awards that are intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) shall be disclosed to, and reapproved by, the Company's stockholders no later than the first stockholder meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the Effective Date occurs (or at any such other time as may be required or allowed by Section 162(m)) in order for Awards that are intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) granted after such time to be exempt from the deduction limitations of Section 162(m).
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused the Plan to be executed effective as of May 15, 2012.

Payments of all amounts due (e.g., Purchase Price and applicable withholding taxes) shall be made by check payable to the Company, unless the Company has provided that such amounts may be satisfied in the following manner: (i) all or a portion of the Purchase Price may be paid by delivery of Shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required; or (ii) you may pay the Purchase Price by authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion of the Shares) acquired upon exercise of the Options and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Purchase Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise. No Shares shall be issued or delivered until full payment of the Purchase Price and applicable withholding taxes, if any, have been made.
Unexercised Options shall expire and be forfeited (without value) to the Company in the event of your termination of employment, unless otherwise provided below:
(i) . If your employment with the Company ceases by reason of your retirement, as defined in the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Retiree Health Benefits Plan, you may, for a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of cessation of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable on the date of retirement.
Retirement
(ii) . If your employment with the Company is terminated due to death, all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised. Your legal representative, beneficiary or other person or persons to whom your rights under the Options shall pass to by will or the laws of descent and distribution, may, for a period of not more than twelve (12) months after the date of death (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options.
Death
In the event of your death after termination of employment described in (i), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) herein, your legal representative, Beneficiary or other person or persons to whom your rights under the Options shall pass to by will or the laws of descent and distribution will have the remaining exercise period awarded to you by your reason of termination as provided in this Award Agreement or the Plan.
(iii) . If your employment with the Company is terminated due to disability (as defined in the Company's disability plan), all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised. You may, for a period of not more than thirty-six (36) months after the date of termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options.
Disability

Except as provided in (v) below, if your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company due to a reduction in force, job abolishment, or at the convenience of the Company, as determined by the Company, you may, for a period of not more than twelve (12) months after such termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable at the date of such termination.
Termination Without Cause

If your employment with the Company is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, all outstanding Options granted to you shall vest and be immediately exercisable with respect to all or any part of the Options which remain unexercised and you may, for a period of not more than three (3) months after such termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options.
Termination following a Change of Control
(vi) . If you voluntarily terminate employment with the Company other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, you may, for a period of not more than three (3) months after such termination of employment (unless the Options expire earlier by their own terms), exercise the Options if and to the extent they were exercisable at the date of such termination.
Voluntary Termination
(vii) . If you are terminated from employment with the Company for Cause, all your Options (whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable) shall be immediately forfeited.
Termination for Cause
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if your employment is terminated as provided in (iv) or (vi) above and you otherwise qualify for retirement under the Company's retirement plan, as defined in the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Retiree Health Benefits Plan, you shall be deemed to have terminated employment because of retirement.
Except as provided in the Plan, the Options granted hereunder are not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Options are exercisable, during your lifetime, only by you. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of the Options, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon the Options or any right or privilege conferred hereby, the Options and the right and privilege conferred hereby shall immediately become null and void.
You shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject to the Options prior to the date such Shares are exercised and issued to you.
If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent with respect to such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent the misconduct (whether or not you are one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), the Plan Administrator may determine that you shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company to the contrary, including, without limitation, any provisions that prevent the Company from unilaterally amending this Award Agreement, you acknowledge that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") has the effect of requiring certain officers of the Company to repay the Company, and for the Company to recoup from such officers, erroneously awarded amounts of incentive-based compensation. If the Act, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar federal or state law requires the Company to recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including stock options and any other equity-based awards) that the
Company has paid or granted to you, you hereby agree, even if you have terminated your employment with the Company, to promptly repay such erroneously awarded incentive compensation to the Company upon its written request. This obligation shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement.
Please establish a Beneficiary Designation for your Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards online at [internal website address] or by contacting the Anadarko Benefits Center at 1-866-472-xxxx, option 1 and then option 1 again. You may update your designation anytime.
Once Options have been exercised and Shares have been delivered to you, you are free to sell, gift or otherwise dispose of such Shares; provided that you comply with the applicable restrictions under the Company's Insider Trading Policy (including the receipt of pre-clearance) and the applicable stock ownership requirements.
If you have any questions about this Award Agreement, please call me at 832-636-xxxx.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
Dear :
                    
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's (the "Company", including affiliates where applicable) Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors has made an Award of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") to you under the Company's 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"). This RSU Award is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan, the summary of the Plan (the "Prospectus") and the provisions of this Award Agreement. Unless defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them under the Plan. The Plan is available on the Anadarko intranet website at the following address: [internal website address].
Effective [Grant Date], you have been granted an Award of RSUs, which vest over a period of time. Provided you remain employed by the Employer until such dates, one-third of the RSUs will vest on [first anniversary of Grant Date], one-third will vest on [second anniversary of Grant Date], and the remaining one-third will vest on [third anniversary of Grant Date] (each considered a "Vesting Period").
            
At the end of each Vesting Period, unless deferred, the number of RSUs that vest shall be converted into shares of unrestricted Anadarko Common Stock and such unrestricted shares, less applicable payroll taxes withheld in the form of shares, shall be delivered to you. Upon receipt, you are free to sell, gift or otherwise dispose of such shares; provided that you comply with the applicable restrictions under the Company's Insider Trading Policy (including the receipt of pre-clearance) and the applicable stock ownership requirements.
Dividend Equivalents shall be paid to you in Common Stock with respect to the RSUs and reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock and paid, less applicable withholding taxes, at such time as the RSUs to which they relate vest and settle (which means that they will be deferred if the underlying RSUs to which they relate were deferred). The RSUs do not have voting rights. They do, however, count toward any applicable stock ownership requirements.
You will be allowed to make an election to defer your entire RSU Award on a separate form provided by Human Resources. All deferral elections and distributions must be made in compliance with Code Section 409A.
If you voluntarily terminate your employment other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, including retirement (as defined by the Anadarko
Petroleum Corporation Retiree Health Benefits Plan), or in the event you are terminated for Cause, all unvested RSUs and unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents will be immediately forfeited. Upon your (i) death, (ii) disability (as defined in the Company's disability plan), (iii) involuntary termination without Cause or (iv) termination of employment for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control all your unvested RSUs will immediately vest and, together with any unpaid RSU Dividend Equivalents accrued but not yet paid, will be paid as soon as administratively practicable. Your RSUs are subject to several restrictions, including that such RSUs may not be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred, or disposed of.
If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent with respect to such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent the misconduct (whether or not you are one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), the Plan Administrator may determine that you shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company to the contrary, including, without limitation, any provisions that prevent the Company from unilaterally amending this Award Agreement, you agree by accepting this Award that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") has the effect of requiring certain officers of the Company to repay the Company, and for the Company to recoup from such officers, erroneously awarded amounts of incentive-based compensation. If the Act, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar federal or state law requires the Company to recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including stock options and any other equity-based awards) that the Company has paid or granted to you, you hereby agree, even if you have terminated your employment with the Company, to promptly repay such erroneously awarded incentive compensation to the Company upon its written request.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL
Dear :
                    
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's (the "Company", including affiliates where applicable) Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") has made an award of Performance Units ("PUs") to you under the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"). This PU Award is subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan, the summary of the Plan (the "Prospectus") and the provisions of this Award Agreement. Unless defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meaning assigned to them under the Plan. The Plan is available on the Anadarko intranet website at the following address: [internal website address].
You have been awarded PUs as your target ("Target"). The value of these PUs, if any, will be dependent upon the Company's relative Total Stockholder Return ("TSR") over the specified Performance Periods. Fifty percent (50%) of your Target is subject to a two-year Performance Period that begins [date] and ends [date] (the "[year] Performance Period") and fifty percent (50%) of your Target is subject to a three-year Performance Period that begins [date] and ends [date] (the "[year] Performance Period"). The [year] and [year] Performance Periods may each be individually referred to herein as a "Performance Period." At the end of each Performance Period, fifty percent (50%) of your Target will vest. The maximum number of PUs that you can earn during each Performance Period will be calculated as follows { x 50% x 200%}with actual payout based on the Company's relative TSR ranking as described below.
                    
            
,
Each PU represents the value of one share of the Company's Common Stock. The payout of PUs is contingent upon the Company's TSR ranking relative to a predetermined peer group during a Performance Period. The TSR measure provides an external comparison of the Company's performance against a peer group of companies and will be calculated as follows:
 
The actual number of PUs you will earn for each Performance Period is based upon the Company's relative TSR ranking as follows:
 
For example, if you were awarded 1,000 target PUs and the Company's relative ranking for the [year] Performance Period is 3
rd
, you will receive 820 PUs (1,000 x 50% x 164%) at the end of the [year] Performance Period (subject to the other terms and conditions of this Award Agreement). If the Company's relative ranking for the [year] Performance Period is 1
st
, you will receive 1,000 PUs (1,000 x 50% x 200%) at the end of the [year] Performance Period (subject to the other terms and conditions of this Award Agreement).
The peer group for the [year] Performance Period and the [year] Performance Period include Apache Corporation, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources Inc., Hess Corporation, Marathon Oil Corporation, Noble Energy Inc., Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Pioneer Natural Resources Company and Plains Exploration & Production Company. If, during either of the Performance Periods, any peer company undergoes a change in corporate capitalization or a corporate transaction (including, but not limited to, a going private transaction, bankruptcy, liquidation, merger, consolidation, etc.), then the Committee shall undertake an evaluation to determine whether such peer company will be replaced with a different peer company (any such replacement company shall be identified pursuant to the rules established by the Committee within the first 90 days of a Performance Period). The Committee has designated Murphy Oil Corporation, Nexen, Inc., and Chesapeake Energy Corporation as replacement companies, in the order just specified.
 
After the end of each Performance Period, the value attributed to the PUs that vest on such date shall be calculated by multiplying the number of PUs earned by the Fair Market Value
1
of the Company's Common Stock on the day the Committee certifies the performance results and approves the payouts. This value shall be reduced by the applicable payroll taxes as a result of such vesting, and the resulting amount shall then be paid to you in cash unless you had made a deferral election.
Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid with respect to the PUs. The PUs do not have voting rights and the PUs do not count toward any applicable stock ownership guidelines.
You will be allowed to make an election to defer your entire PU award on a separate form provided by Human Resources. All deferral elections and distributions must be made in compliance with Code Section 409A.
If you voluntarily terminate your employment other than for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control, or in the event you are terminated for Cause, all unvested PUs will be immediately forfeited. Except in the event of a Change of Control, if your employment is involuntarily terminated without Cause prior to the end of a Performance Period, you will receive a payout, paid after the end of the Performance Period, based on actual performance and in accordance with your deferral election, if applicable. Upon your (i) death, (ii) disability (as defined in the Company's disability plan), or (iii) termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason during the Applicable Period following a Change of Control all your unvested PUs will become immediately vested and paid to you as soon as administratively practicable in an amount equal to your Target multiplied by the Fair Market Value of the Company's Common Stock for the date of such determining event (with respect to the termination of your employment following a Change of Control as discussed in (iii) above, the date of such determining event shall be the first trading day immediately preceding the date of the Change of Control). Upon your retirement (as defined by the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Retiree Health Benefits Plan) prior to the end of a Performance Period, you will receive a prorated payout, paid after the end of the Performance Period, based on actual performance and the number of months you worked during the Performance Period. Your PUs are subject to several restrictions, including that such PUs may not be transferred, sold, assigned, pledged, exchanged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred, or disposed of to the extent then subject to restrictions.
If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if you knowingly engaged in the misconduct, were grossly negligent with respect to such misconduct, or knowingly or grossly negligently failed to prevent the misconduct (whether or not you are one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), the Plan Administrator may determine that you shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award earned or accrued during the twelve-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.

As of any given date, the closing sales price at which Common Stock is sold on such date as reported in the NYSE-Composite Transactions by
The Wall Street Journal
or any other comparable service the Plan Administrator may determine is reliable for such date, or if no Common Stock was traded on such date, on the next preceding day on which Common Stock was so traded. If the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock cannot be determined pursuant to the preceding provisions, the "Fair Market Value" of the Common Stock shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in such a manner as it deems appropriate, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Award Agreement or any other agreement between you and the Company to the contrary, including, without limitation, any provisions that prevent the Company from unilaterally amending this Award Agreement, you agree by accepting this Award that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") has the effect of requiring certain officers of the Company to repay the Company, and for the Company to recoup from such officers, erroneously awarded amounts of incentive-based compensation. If the Act, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any similar federal or state law requires the Company to recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation (including stock options and any other equity-based awards) that the Company has paid or granted to you, you hereby agree, even if you have terminated your employment with the Company, to promptly repay such erroneously awarded incentive compensation to the Company upon its written request. This obligation shall survive the termination of this Award Agreement.
