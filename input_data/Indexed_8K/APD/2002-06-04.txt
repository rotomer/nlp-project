Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. - ------- ---------------------------------------------- The Employee Benefit Plans Committee (the "Committee") of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. ("Air Products") annually considers and approves the selection of Air Products Retirement Savings and Stock Ownership Plan's (the "RSSOP"), independent public accountants. The Committee decided on 29 May 2002 to no longer engage Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as the RSSOP's independent public accountants and has engaged KPMG LLP to serve as the RSSOP's independent public accountants for the plan year ending 30 September 2002. Andersen's reports on the RSSOP's financial statements for the past two years did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the RSSOP's two most recent plan years and through the date of this Form 8-K, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter in connection with its report on the RSSOP's financial statements for such years. There were no reportable events as listed in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Air Products has provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosure. Attached as Exhibit 16 is a copy of Andersen's letter, dated 30 May 2002, stating its agreement with such statements. During the RSSOP's two most recent plan years and through the date of this Form 8-K, Air Products did not consult with KPMG LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or posed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the RSSOP's financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
