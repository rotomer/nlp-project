Exhibit 99.1 [AIR PRODUCTS LOGO] News Release AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. 7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501 03096 AIR PRODUCTS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE OF 51 CENTS Access the Q2 earnings teleconference scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT today by calling (913) 981-4910 and entering passcode184937, or listen on the Web at www.airproducts.com/Invest/EarningsReleases/Teleconference.htm. LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 24, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $114 million, or diluted earnings per share of $.51, for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. This compares to prior year net income of $126 million, or diluted earnings per share of $.57. Prior year results included a gain on the sale of the company's U.S. packaged gas business of $26 million after-tax, or $.12 per share, and a charge for a global cost reduction plan of $19 million after-tax, or $.09 per share. Quarter revenues were $1,578 million, up 20 percent from the prior year and 9 percent sequentially. The effects of acquisitions, divestitures, currency and the pass-through effect of higher natural gas prices increased sales by 14 percent. Without these factors, sales were up 6 percent over the prior year and 4 percent sequentially. Higher gases volumes and improved chemical volumes and pricing accounted for the underlying revenue increase. Operating income of $179 million increased 16 percent from $155 million in the prior year, which included a $31 million charge for a global cost reduction plan. Without this charge, operating income declined $7 million or 4 percent, as higher chemical raw material and energy costs were partially offset by higher volumes, favorable currency effects and acquisitions. Commenting on the quarter, John P. Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Margins suffered this quarter due to higher raw material and energy costs and plant turnarounds. Margin recovery is our main focus in the near-term. However, we are -more-
Page 2 of 11 encouraged by improved volumes in electronics, healthcare, CPI, Asia merchant gases and higher amines, and we continue to see benefits from our portfolio management actions, including the divestiture of our U.S. packaged gases business early last year and our entry into the U.S. homecare market in October." Industrial gas sales of $1,130 million increased 27 percent. Of this increase, 19 percent is accounted for by higher natural gas pass through, currency and acquisitions. Operating income of $153 million increased 25 percent from $123 million in the prior year, which included a $26 million charge for a global cost reduction plan. Operating income was up $4 million or 3 percent without this charge. Higher worldwide gases volumes, acquisitions and favorable currency effects drove this improvement. Sequentially, gases revenues increased 10 percent. Of this increase, higher natural gas pass through, currency and acquisitions accounted for 7 percent. Operating income was down 10 percent, as a decline in North American gases volumes and the impacts of higher CPI plant outages were partially offset by favorable acquisition and currency effects. The first quarter also benefited from a favorable incentive compensation adjustment. Chemicals sales of $399 million increased 11 percent versus the prior year. Operating income of $34 million declined 20 percent from $42 million, which included a charge of $5 million for a global cost reduction plan. This decline was driven by higher feedstock costs and weaker performance polymers (emulsions) volumes, partially offset by favorable currency and stronger higher amines and performance products (polyurethane and epoxy additives) shipments. Sequentially, chemicals revenues increased 13 percent on higher volumes and improved pricing. Operating income was up 2 percent, with improved volumes mainly in higher amines and performance solutions (surfactants) and favorable currency offsetting higher feedstock costs. Air Products' equipment segment sales were $50 million. Operating income of $3 million was down $2 million versus the prior year on lower air separation and helium equipment activity. -more-
Page 3 of 11 Regarding Air Products' outlook, Mr. Jones said, "The slowdown in demand across the basic manufacturing industries is affecting our North American merchant gas and performance polymers volumes, and significantly higher energy and raw material costs are impacting our chemicals segment and to a lesser extent, gases. In addition, delays in new LNG heat exchanger orders and very low activity in air separation plants are reducing expectations for equipment segment profitability. Continued economic uncertainty is impacting near-term demand for our products and, as a result, we are revising our full year earnings outlook to a range of $2.23 to $2.37 per share, with third quarter earnings per share in the range of $.54 to $.58. In this weak environment, we are continuing our portfolio management actions and are identifying ways to improve our cost structure. Such actions could reduce our near-term outlook." ***NOTE: The forward-looking statements contained in this release are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed. Factors that might cause forward-looking statements to differ materially from actual results include, among other things, overall economic and business conditions different than those currently anticipated and demand for Air Products' goods and services; competitive factors in the industries in which it competes; interruption in ordinary sources of supply; the ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers; spikes in the pricing of natural gas; changes in government regulations; consequences of acts of war or terrorism impacting the United States' and other markets; the success of implementing cost reduction programs; the timing, impact and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies; the impact of tax and other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which Air Products and its affiliates operate; and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized.

Page 8 of 11 AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. and Subsidiaries NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Millions of dollars, except per share) Asset Retirement Obligations The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," on 1 October 2002. The Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The company's asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with Gases on-site long-term supply contracts under which the company has built a facility on land leased from the customer and is obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. At 1 October 2002, the company recognized transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation. An after-tax transition charge of $2.9 was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. The ongoing expense on an annual basis resulting from the initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 is approximately $1. Acquisitions In October 2002, the company acquired American Homecare Supply, LLC (AHS), a homecare market leader throughout the northeastern United States, for $166. Subsequently, AHS has continued to expand through the acquisition of small homecare businesses. In July 2002, the company purchased an additional 22% of the outstanding shares of San Fu Chemical Company, Ltd. (San Fu), increasing the company's ownership interest from 48% to 70%. As of 30 June 2002, the company accounted for its investment in San Fu using the equity method. With this acquisition, the company obtained control and consolidated this investment. The above acquisitions contributed $172 and $28 to sales and operating income for the six months ended 31 March 2003. Divestitures On 28 February 2002, the company completed the sale of the majority of its U.S. packaged gas business, excluding the electronic gases and magnetic resonance imaging related helium operations, to Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). The company also sold its packaged gas operations in the Carolinas and in Southern Virginia to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, N.C. For the five months ended 28 February 2002, the assets sold generated revenues of approximately $100 also with a modest contribution to operating income. The proceeds from these transactions were $254.5. The results for the three and six months ended 31 March 2002 included a gain of $55.7 ($25.7 after-tax, or $.12 per share). On 1 April 2003, the company completed the sale of the majority of its Canadian packaged gas business to the BOC Group for approximately $40. -more-
Page 9 of 11 Global Cost Reduction Plan The results for the three and six months ended 31 March 2002 included a charge of $30.8 ($18.9 after-tax, or $.09 per share) for a global cost reduction plan including U.S. packaged gas divestiture related reductions. The plan included 333 position eliminations, resulting in a charge of $27.1 for severance and pension related benefits. A charge of $3.7 was recognized for asset impairments related to the planned sale or closure of two small chemicals facilities. The restructuring charges included in cost of sales, selling and administrative, research and development, and other expense were $13.4, $14.1, $.4, and $2.9, respectively. This cost reduction plan was completed as expected in March 2003. Equity Affiliates' Income Income from equity affiliates for the six months ended 31 March 2003 included $14 for adjustments related to divestitures recorded in prior periods. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.06 and $.09 to diluted earnings per share for the three months ended 31 March 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income from equity affiliates contributed $.15 and $.16 to diluted earnings per share for six months ended 31 March 2003 and 2002, respectively. -more-
