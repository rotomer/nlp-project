LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (June 30, 2003) - Air Products (NYSE:APD), a globally diversified gases and chemicals company and a leading supplier to the semiconductor industry, announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Electronic Chemicals business of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company, a division of Ashland Inc. (NYSE:ASH), in a cash transaction valued at approximately USD $300 million. The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to be accretive to earnings in the first year. Closing would follow receipt of regulatory approvals. Ashland's Electronic Chemicals business is a leading global electronic service provider and supplier of ultrapure specialty chemicals used by the electronics industry to make semiconductor devices. Ashland Electronic Chemicals business offerings include ACT(R) photoresist strippers; etch residue strippers and low-k dielectric and copper strippers; high-purity process chemicals (HPPC) offering basic and custom-performance blends of acids and solvents; copper plating solutions; chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) slurries and post-CMP cleaners; and Fab Services which provide on-site chemical management, parts cleaning, and tool assembly and refurbishment for semiconductor manufacturing plants--or fabs.
The USD $200 million Electronic Chemicals business of Ashland has approximately 800 employees and has built a worldwide network of sales and marketing offices. The ACT photoresist strippers have application labs and manufacturing facilities in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan; near Seoul, South Korea, in the Kyonggi Province, Pyongtaek City; Kawasaki, Japan; and Easton, Pa. HPPC products are manufactured at the Easton, Pa. plant, as well as in Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Pueblo, Colo.; Dallas, Texas; and Milan, Italy. The CMP suite of products has an application lab in Dublin, Ohio and is manufactured in Dallas, Texas. Fab Services have various on-site chemical management locations throughout North America, as well as a European base in Glasgow, Scotland. Parts cleaning is conducted out of Carrollton, Texas, and Phoenix, Ariz., where tool refurbishment also takes place. "The Ashland acquisition strongly illustrates our corporate-wide strategy to identify and invest in higher growth, higher return businesses," said John P. Jones, chairman and CEO, Air Products. "For electronics in particular, this deal is the right fit at the right time because it capitalizes on our unique skills as the world's only combined gases and chemicals company while strengthening our global position as a market leader in the industry," he stated. "Over the past year, we have reinvested more than half a billion dollars in our growth platforms, and we will continue to look for similar opportunities that effectively blend our strengths and skills with our corporate strategy." Along with Electronics, Air Products' growth platforms include Refinery Hydrogen and Energy Solutions, Performance Materials and Healthcare. The aim of the Electronics Division is to be the premier materials service solution provider to the electronics industry throughout the world. "The acquisition of Ashland's Electronic Chemicals business makes sense on so many levels for Air Products," said Gerald G. Ermentrout, vice president and general manager of Air Products' Electronics Division. "First, it will give us a more intimate electronic chemicals process knowledge that will enhance our ability to develop new materials and solutions. Second, Ashland's product line complements our existing portfolio and significantly expands our position in high growth specialty materials, as well as our presence in Asia. And third, our two 2
companies have employees who share similar cultures, experiences and values such as safety, innovation, quality and customer service," said Mr. Ermentrout. "What this means for our customers is they will see an immediate increase in the breadth of our offerings and global service capabilities, increased depth of understanding of their processes, and additional integrated solutions development for current and next generation technologies."
