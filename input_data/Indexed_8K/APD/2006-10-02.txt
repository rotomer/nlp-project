Exhibit 99.2
7201 Hamilton Boulevard Allentown, PA 18195-1501
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 2, 2006)  Air Products today announced that it will record charges totaling approximately $0.32-$0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 related to today's announcement of the sale of its Amines business and its recently announced corporate-wide reorganization and streamlining initiatives.
Approximately half of the charges are related to the Amines business sale, including severance and other costs such as ongoing contractual obligations and contract terminations. The remainder of the charge is related to the corporate reorganization and streamlining initiatives. The company will provide final details on the restructuring charges and Amines sale when it reports fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2006 earnings on October 25.
"We are committed to making Air Products more focused and less cyclical. Our announced organizational changes and streamlining of our management structure, coupled with the sale of our Amines business, will enable us to sharpen our focus on growth and produce higher returns on capital. We anticipate that the sale of our Polymers business in 2007 will further contribute to these goals," said John Jones, Air Products' chairman and chief executive officer.
In keeping with its new operating structure, Air Products will release financial details beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 for the following six business segments: Tonnage Gases, Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, Healthcare, Equipment and Energy, and Chemicals.
