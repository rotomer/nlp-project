LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (October 25, 2006)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $128 million or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.57 for its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006. This includes $0.13 of discontinued operations related to the sale of the company's amines business and $0.21 for corporate reorganization and streamlining initiatives, as previously announced. Also included is a $0.03 per share charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change for asset retirement obligations. On a continuing operations basis excluding the impact of these items, net income was $210 million and EPS was $0.94, up 19 and 22 percent, respectively, compared with prior year results.*
The discussion of fourth quarter and full year results in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. It excludes the impacts of the above items and includes the proforma impact of stock option expensing on fiscal 2005 results. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Fourth quarter revenues of $2,359 million were up 18 percent from the prior year on strong volume performance in the company's Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy segments. Record operating income of $305 million was up 25 percent versus prior year.
For fiscal 2006, sales of $8,850 million were up 14 percent and net income of $795 million was up 17 percent over the prior year due to higher volumes broadly across the Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy segments. Diluted EPS of $3.50 was up 19 percent.
John Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We had a strong fourth quarter, and closed out another excellent year in 2006. For the third consecutive year, we achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth and a meaningful improvement in return on capital, which this year was up 130 basis points. In addition to our solid operating performance, we overcame the challenges presented by last year's hurricanes, sold our amines business, reorganized for growth and improved returns, and completed the first $500 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase program."
Individual Business Segment Performance
As announced on October 2, 2006, Air Products now manages its operations, assesses performance and reports results by six global business segments. For the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter:
 
Outlook
Looking forward, Jones said, "We enter fiscal 2007 well positioned to drive continued strong top-line and earnings growth and focused on achieving our 12.5 percent return on capital goal. We expect to see strong volume growth from the full-year impact of the new hydrogen plants we brought onstream in fiscal 2006, continued growth from new merchant and tonnage plants in Asia, and continuing strength in our Electronics and Performance Materials end markets. While we have challenges in Healthcare, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to meaningfully improve the business this year.
"Building off of the momentum we achieved in 2006, our people are generating real productivity across our businesses, using continuous improvement tools and SAP. All of the actions we are taking will make us a more focused, less cyclical, higher growth and higher return company."
The company currently anticipates fiscal year 2007 EPS in the range of $3.84 to $4.00 per share. On a continuing operations basis, this represents year-over-year earnings growth of 10 to 14 percent. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ending December 31, 2006, EPS is expected to be between $0.90 and $0.95.

1. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In March 2006, the company announced it was exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the company's ongoing portfolio management activities. On 23 August 2006, the company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Amines business to Taminco N.V. (Taminco). The sale closed on 29 September 2006. The sales price was $211.2 in cash, with certain liabilities assumed by the purchaser. The company recorded a loss of $40.0 ($23.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) in connection with the sale of the Amines business and the recording of certain environmental and contractual obligations that the company retained related to the Pace facility. The Amines business produced methylamines and higher amines products used globally in household, industrial and agricultural products. The sale of the Amines business included the employees and certain assets and liabilities of the production facilities located in Pace, Fla.; St. Gabriel, La.; and Camacari, Brazil. The Amines business is being accounted for as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. In addition, fourth quarter results also included a charge of $8.3 ($5.2 after tax or $.02 per share) for costs associated with a contract termination.
2. GLOBAL COST REDUCTION PLAN
The results from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 included a charge of $72.1 ($46.8 after-tax, or $.21 per share) for a global cost reduction plan (2006 Plan). This charge included $60.6 for severance and pension related costs for approximately 325 position eliminations and $11.5 for asset disposals and facility closures. Details of this charge are shown below.
Several cost reduction initiatives in Europe will result in the elimination of about two-thirds of the 325 positions at a cost of $37.6. The company will reorganize and streamline certain organizations/activities in Europe which will focus on improving effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, in anticipation of the sale of a small business a charge of $1.4 was recognized in the fourth quarter to write down the assets to net realizable value.
The company completed a strategy review of its Electronics business in 2006. The company has decided to rationalize some products and assets reflecting a simpler portfolio. A charge of $10.1 was recognized principally for an asset disposal and the write-down of certain investments/assets to net realizable value. Additionally, a charge of $3.8 was recognized for severance and pension related costs.
In addition to the Europe and Electronics initiatives, the company continues to implement cost reduction and productivity related efforts to simplify its management structure and business practices. A charge of $19.2 for severance and related pension costs was recognized for these efforts.
3. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The company adopted Financial Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" (FIN No. 47) effective 30 September 2006 and recorded an after-tax charge of $6.2 as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. On 30 September 2006, the company recognized the transition amounts for existing asset retirement obligation liabilities, associated capitalizable costs and accumulated depreciation.
 
4. INVENTORY ADJUSTMENT
The company recorded a charge of $17.3 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to adjust its North American Healthcare inventories to actual based on physical inventory counts.
5. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006 as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the company sold its DNT production facility in Geismar, La., to BASF Corporation for $155.0. Expense was recognized for the write-off of the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and will continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and syngas for BASF and other customers.
6. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the company, the company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
7. ACQUISITION OF TOMAH
PRODUCTS
3
On 31 March 2006, the company acquired TomahProducts of Milton, Wis., in a cash transaction valued at $120.5. A preliminary purchase price allocation was made in the second quarter. This allocation was revised in the third quarter based on a preliminary third-party appraisal and the allocation will be finalized in early fiscal 2007. As of 30 September 2006, goodwill recognized in this transaction amounted to $73.1 and identified intangibles amounted to $24.1. With sales of $73 in 2005, Tomah produces specialty surfactants and processing aids primarily for growth segments of the institutional and industrial cleaning, mining and oil field industries, among others. The Tomah acquisition reflects the company's strategy to expand its presence in profitable market segments where it can build on its surface science expertise.

8. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter and as of 30 September 2006 had purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1. The company expects to complete an additional $500 of the program by 30 September 2007.
9. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7 which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
10. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY
On 23 May 2006, the company entered into a five-year $1,200 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the company and certain of its subsidiaries. This agreement terminates and replaces the company's $700 revolving credit agreement dated 18 December 2003.
 
11. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Insurance recoveries for property damages and business interruption are recognized as claims are settled. Operating income for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006 included a net gain of $15.4 and $51.7, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006, the company collected insurance proceeds of $18.0 and $67.0, respectively. The company estimates the impact of business interruption at $(.9) and $(36.7) for the three and twelve months ended 30 September 2006.
A table summarizing the impact of the Hurricanes is provided below:
12. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective 1 October 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," and related interpretations and began expensing the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. Prior to 1 October 2005, the company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in net income for employee stock options, as options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R in 2006 reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by $.13. This excludes the acceleration of expense for share-based compensation awards included in the global cost reduction plan charge. The pro forma impact of expensing employee stock options in 2005 would have been a reduction of diluted earnings per share of $.13 for the year based on the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123R requires a change in accounting for awards granted on or after 1 October 2005 to accelerate expense to the retirement eligible date for individuals who meet the requirements for immediate vesting of awards upon their retirement. The impact of this change in 2006 for all share-based compensation programs reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by $.03, principally related to the stock option program, and is included in the total impact of adopting SFAS No. 123R of $.13 for the year.
The company adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated prior periods. Under this transition method, compensation cost associated with employee stock options recognized in 2006 includes amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of stock option awards granted prior to 1 October 2005, and amortization related to new awards granted on or after 1 October 2005.
Because certain of the company's share-based compensation programs included a provision for a contingent cash settlement in the event of a change in control, the carrying amount of these awards based on a grant-date intrinsic value is presented separately in the 30 September 2005 balance sheet outside of shareholders' equity. During the quarter ended 30 June 2006, the company undertook a process to amend its outstanding share-based compensation awards to remove the contingent cash settlement provision, resulting in no separate presentation outside of shareholders' equity as of 30 June 2006.
 
13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
In September 2006, the company completed a business reorganization that aligns its organization structure to its strategic direction. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2006, the company will report financial information based on six business segments. The company manages its operations, assesses performance, and reports results by these segments, which are organized based on differences in product and/or type of customer. The company's six business segments consist of Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, Equipment and Energy, Healthcare, and Chemicals.
