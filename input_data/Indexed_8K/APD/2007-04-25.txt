1. ACQUISITION PENDING
On 8 January 2007, the Company announced it had reached a definitive agreement with The Linde Group to acquire the industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o. o. for 370 million Euros. The transaction has received all necessary regulatory approvals as of 18 April 2007 and is now subject to customary contractual closing conditions. Linde was required to sell BOC Gazy as a condition of regulatory approval of its purchase of The BOC Group plc in September 2006. The BOC Gazy business had fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately 126 million Euros. The business has approximately 750 employees, five major industrial gas plants, and six cylinder transfills serving customers across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, steel and base metals, among others.
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In March 2006, the Company announced it was exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the Company's ongoing portfolio management activities. The Company sold its Amines business to Taminco N.V. on 29 September 2006. Accordingly, the Amines business is being accounted for as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.
3. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006, as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the Company sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, to BASF Corporation for $155.0. The Company wrote off the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Air Products industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas to customers.
4. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the Company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the Company, the Company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the Company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the Company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the Company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the Company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
5. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The Company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7, which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the Company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
 
6. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The Company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2006 and purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1 during 2006. The Company expects to complete an additional $500 of the program during fiscal year 2007 and during the six months ended 31 March 2007 purchased 3.5 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $247.4.
7. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Operating income for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006 included a net gain of $19.9 and $27.2, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and six months ended 31 March 2006, the Company collected insurance proceeds of $10.8 and $35.8, respectively. The Company estimated the impact of business interruption at $(5.2) and $(31.2) for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006, respectively.
A table summarizing the estimated impact of the Hurricanes for the three and six months ended 31 March 2006 is provided below:
The Company closed-out its insurance claim related to the Hurricanes by the end of fiscal 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company collected $19.1 of insurance proceeds.
