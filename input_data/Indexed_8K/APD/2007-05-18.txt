Exhibit 99.1
SECTION 1.  . (a) The annual meeting of the stockholders of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (hereinafter called the Corporation) for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business as may be properly brought before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors (hereinafter called the Board) shall each year fix, which date shall be within thirteen months subsequent to the last annual meeting of stockholders.
Annual Meetings
(b) To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (i) specified in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given written notice thereof, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary, not more than 120 days or less than 90 days in advance of the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 calendar days before or more than 60 calendar days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120 calendar day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90 calendar day prior to such annual meeting. Any such notice shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws of the Corporation, the language of the proposed amendment, (ii) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal, a representation to that effect. No business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders except in accordance with this Section 1(b), and the chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders may refuse to permit any business to be brought before an annual meeting without compliance with the foregoing procedures or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's proposal without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (v) of the preceding sentence.

The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (hereinafter called the Exchange Act) and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by management of the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting; provided, however, that if such stockholder does not appear or send a qualified representative to present such proposal at such annual meeting, the Corporation need not present such proposal for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.
SECTION 2.  . Special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or purposes prescribed in the notice of the meeting, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or a majority of the whole Board and shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as shall be designated in the notice thereof.
Special Meetings
SECTION 3.  . Each stockholder of record shall be given written notice of each meeting of stockholders, which notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Except as otherwise provided by law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten or more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the stockholder as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notice of any meeting may be given to a stockholder by a form of electronic transmission consented to by such stockholder.
Notice of Meetings
When a meeting of stockholders is adjourned to another place, date, or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date, and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more than thirty days after the date for which the meeting was originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
SECTION 4.  . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, at the principal place of business of the Corporation during normal business hours. The list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and be subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present. The list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
List of Stockholders
SECTION 5.  . The holders of a majority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for all purposes at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business unless and except that the presence of a larger number may be required by law. Where a separate vote by a class or classes is required, a majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders who are present in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time whether or not a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting, unless a different period is prescribed by applicable law.
Quorum; Adjournment

Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman; or, in the absence of the Chairman, by the Chief Executive Officer if separate from the Chairman; or, in the absence of both the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, by the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; or, in the absence of the foregoing persons, by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors. The Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting; or, in the absence of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary shall so act; or, in their absence, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Organization
SECTION 7.  . The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.
Conduct of Business
SECTION 8.  . Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, at every meeting of the stockholders each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. All voting, except on the election of directors and where otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon demand therefore by a stockholder entitled to vote or the holder of a proxy of such person, a stock vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
Voting and Proxies
SECTION 9. . The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.
Inspectors of Election
SECTION 1.  . The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
General Powers
SECTION 2.  . The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed from time to time by a vote of the majority of the whole Board.

Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (d) all information that would be reasonably relevant to a determination by the Board as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder is "independent" within the meaning of all applicable securities law and stock exchange requirements; (e) all information that would be relevant to a determination by the Board (or any relevant committee) as to whether each nominee proposed by such stockholder meets any standards for Board membership set forth by the Board (or any committee thereof) in any publicly available documents; (f) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board; (g) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director if so elected; and (h) if the stockholder intends to solicit proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s), a representation to that effect. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders to elect directors and the Board may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure or if the stockholder solicits proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee(s) without such stockholder having made the representation required by clause (h) of the preceding sentence.

The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Any indemnification under this Article V (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article V, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding ("disinterested directors"), or (ii) if there are no disinterested directors or if such disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders; provided that in the event of a Change in Control of the Corporation, any such determination made with respect to conduct occurring before the Change in Control shall be made by independent legal counsel. Notwithstanding the above, to the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Authorization of Indemnification
Section 4. . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article V, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article V. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article V nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 4 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Indemnification by a Court
Section 5. . If any action, suit or proceeding is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to an indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by the indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes of this Article V to have been successful with respect thereto.
Successful Defense; Partial Indemnification
If an indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee or on the indemnitee's behalf in connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, and any appeal therefrom but not for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the indemnitee for the portion of such expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred to which the indemnitee is entitled.
Section 6. . Expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by the indemnitee in defending a threatened or pending civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with an enforcement action pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Article V, shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding within ten (10) days after receipt by the Corporation of (i) a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, and (ii) an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay such amount or amounts, only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation or, in the case of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 7(b) of this Article V, the indemnitee is not successful in such action. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the indemnitee to make such repayment. Advances shall be unsecured and interest-free.
Advance Payment of Expenses
Section 7.
Procedure for Indemnification
(a) To obtain indemnification, an indemnitee shall promptly submit to the Secretary of the Corporation a written request, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. The Secretary shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Directors in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification.
(b) The Corporation's determination whether to grant the indemnitee's indemnification request shall be made promptly, and in any event within 10 days following receipt of a request for indemnification pursuant to Section 6 of this Article V or within 30 days of any other indemnification request. The right to indemnification as granted by Section 1, 2, or 6 of this Article V shall be enforceable by the indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or fails to respond within such 10-day period or 30-day period, respectively. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 6 of this Article V) that the indemnitee has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, as applicable hereof, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article V, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or one of its committees, its independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the indemnitee has or has not met the applicable standard of conduct. An indemnitee's expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such proceeding or otherwise shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Section 8. . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article V.
Insurance
Section 9. . For purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

Limitation on Indemnification
(a) . To indemnify or advance expenses to an indemnitee with respect to an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, except with respect to an action, suit or proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification (which shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 7(b) and 10(b) of this Article V), unless such action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Claims Initiated by an Indemnitee
(b) To indemnify an indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Article V or any other right to indemnification, unless the indemnitee is successful in establishing the indemnitee's right to indemnification in such action, suit or proceeding, in whole or in part, or unless and to the extent that the court in such action, suit or proceeding shall determine that, despite the indemnitee's failure to establish their right to indemnification, the indemnitee is entitled to indemnity for such expenses; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10(b) is intended to limit the Corporation's obligation with respect to the advancement of expenses to an indemnitee in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding.
(c) To indemnify an indemnitee on account of any proceeding with respect to which final judgment is rendered against the indemnitee for payment or an accounting of profits arising from the purchase or sale by the indemnitee of securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any similar successor statute.
Section 11. . The Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify an indemnitee under this Article for amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the Corporation's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding in any manner that would impose any fine or other obligation on the indemnitee without the indemnitee's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Certain Settlement Provisions
Section 12. . The provisions for indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which an indemnitee may have under any provision of law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, in any court in which a proceeding is brought, the vote of the Corporation's stockholders or disinterested directors, agreements, or otherwise, and the indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the indemnitee has ceased acting as a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of the indemnitee.
Nonexclusivity
SECTION 1. . The Board shall designate the officers, employees, and agents of the Corporation who shall have power to execute and deliver deeds, contracts, mortgages, bonds, debentures, checks, drafts, and other orders for the payment of money and other documents for and in the name of the Corporation and may authorize such officers, employees, and agents to delegate such power (including authority to redelegate) by written instrument to other officers, employees, or agents of the Corporation.

Proxies in Respect of Stock or Other Securities of Other Corporations

Where a certificate is countersigned (1) by a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case an officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate has been issued or delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may nevertheless be issued and delivered by the Corporation as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or whose facsimile signature has been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions regarding share certificates, the Corporation may provide that, subject to the rights of stockholders under applicable law, some or all of any or all classes or series of the stock may be uncertificated shares.
Certificates of Stock
SECTION 2. . In the event of loss, theft, or destruction of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place pursuant to such regulations as the Board may establish concerning proof of such loss, theft, or destruction and concerning the giving of a satisfactory bond or bonds of indemnity.
Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates
SECTION 3. . Transfers of stock shall be made only upon the transfer books of the Corporation kept at an office of the Corporation or by transfer agents designated to transfer shares of the stock of the Corporation. Except where a certificate is issued in accordance with Section 2 of Article VI of these Bylaws, an outstanding certificate for the number of shares involved shall be surrendered for cancellation before a new certificate is issued therefore.
Transfers of Stock
SECTION 4. . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date on which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of any meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty days prior to the time for such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion, or exchange of stock or for any other purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.
Record Date
SECTION 5. . The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
