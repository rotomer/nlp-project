LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa.

On a continuing operations basis, net income increased $78 million, or 38 percent, and diluted EPS was up $.38, or 42 percent, compared with the prior year.
Record third quarter revenue of $2,595 million was up 16 percent from the prior year on higher volumes and pricing in the Merchant segment and strong volumes in the Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Operating income of $365 million was up 25 percent versus the prior year.
John Jones, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We again exceeded expectations with record performance this quarter.

1. CUSTOMER CONTRACT TERMINATION
By agreement dated 1 June 2007, the Company entered into a settlement with a customer to resolve a dispute related to a dinitrotoluene (DNT) supply agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the DNT supply agreement was terminated and certain other agreements between the companies were amended. Selected amendments to the agreements were subject to the approval of the customer's Board of Directors, which approval was obtained on 12 July 2007. As a result, the Company will recognize a before-tax gain in the range of $30 to $37 in the fourth quarter.
2. PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENT LOSS
A number of senior managers and others have retired or announced their intention to retire in fiscal year 2007. A settlement loss will be recognized at the time of the cash payment of the liability. The total settlement loss anticipated for these 2007 retirements is expected to be approximately $30-$35. The company will recognize about $10 of this charge in the fourth quarter of 2007 with the remaining balance recognized in fiscal year 2008. The actual amount of the settlement loss will be based upon current pension assumptions (e.g. discount rate) at the time of the cash payments of the liabilities.
3. INCOME TAXES
In June 2007, the Company settled tax audits through fiscal year 2004 with the Internal Revenue Service. The audit settlement resulted in a tax benefit of $27.5 ($.12 per share).
4. ACQUISITION
On 30 April 2007, the Company acquired 98.1% of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o.o from The Linde Group for 370 million Euros or $506.8. The results of operations for BOC Gazy were included in the Company's consolidated income statement after the acquisition date. A preliminary purchase price allocation has been made and will be finalized when information needed to affirm underlying estimates is obtained. The preliminary estimated values as of the acquisition date for plant and equipment amounted to $193.2, identified intangibles amounted to $158.8, and goodwill amounted to $140.7. With this acquisition, the Company has obtained a significant market position in Central Europe's industrial gases market. The BOC Gazy business had fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately 126 million Euros. The business has approximately 750 employees, five major industrial gas plants, and six cylinder transfills serving customers across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, steel and base metals, among others.
5. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In March 2006, the Company announced it was exploring the sale of its Amines and Polymers businesses as part of the Company's ongoing portfolio management activities. The Company sold its Amines business to Taminco N.V. on 29 September 2006. Accordingly, the Amines business has been accounted for as discontinued operations.
6. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a $1,500 share repurchase program. The Company began the share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2006 and purchased 7.7 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $496.1 during 2006. The Company expects to complete an additional $500 of the program during fiscal year 2007 and during the nine months ended 30 June 2007 purchased 5.1 million of its outstanding shares at a cost of $373.1.
7. GAIN ON SALE OF A CHEMICAL FACILITY
On 31 March 2006, as part of its announced restructuring of its Polyurethane Intermediates business, the Company sold its dinitrotoluene (DNT) production facility in Geismar, Louisiana, to BASF Corporation for $155.0. The Company wrote off the remaining net book value of assets sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $70.4 ($42.9 after-tax, or $.19 per share) on the transaction. The Company's industrial gas facilities at this same location were not included in this transaction and continue to produce and supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas to customers.
 
8. IMPAIRMENT OF LOANS RECEIVABLE
In the second quarter of 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $65.8 ($42.4 after-tax, or $.19 per share) for the impairment of loans receivable from a long-term supplier of sulfuric acid, used in the production of DNT for the Company's Polyurethane Intermediates business. To facilitate the supplier's ability to emerge from bankruptcy in June 2003 and continue to supply product to the Company, the Company and other third parties agreed to participate in the supplier's financing. Subsequent to the initial financing, the Company and the supplier's other principal lender executed standstill agreements which temporarily amended the terms of the loan agreements, primarily to allow the deferral of principal and interest payments. Based on events occurring within the second quarter of 2006, management concluded that the Company would not be able to collect any amounts due. These events included the Company's announcement of its plan to restructure its Polyurethane Intermediates business and notification to the supplier of the Company's intent not to enter into further standstill agreements.
9. PURCHASE OF CRYOGENIC VESSEL EQUIPMENT
On 31 March 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase certain cryogenic vessel equipment for $297.2, thereby terminating an operating lease originally scheduled to end 30 September 2006. The Company originally sold and leased back this equipment in 2001, resulting in proceeds of $301.9 and recognition of a deferred gain of $134.7, which was included in other noncurrent liabilities. In March 2006, the Company recorded the purchase of the equipment for $297.2 and reduced the carrying value of the equipment by the $134.7 deferred gain derived from the original sale-leaseback transaction.
10. HURRICANES
In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company's New Orleans industrial gas complex sustained extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Other industrial gases and chemicals facilities in the Gulf Coast region also sustained damages from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in fiscal 2005.
Operating income for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006 included a net gain of $9.1 and $36.3, respectively, related to insurance recoveries net of property damage and other expenses incurred. During the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006, the Company collected insurance proceeds of $13.2 and $49.0, respectively. The Company estimated the impact of business interruption at $(4.6) and $(35.8) for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006, respectively.
A table summarizing the estimated impact of the Hurricanes for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2006 is provided below:
The Company closed-out its insurance claim related to the Hurricanes by the end of fiscal 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company collected $19.1 of insurance proceeds. Operating income for the three and nine months ended 30 June 2007 was not impacted except for higher depreciation expense of $1.4 and $4.2, respectively.
