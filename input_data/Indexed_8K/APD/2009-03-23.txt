Item 8.01 Other Events.
On March 18, 2009, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors approved changes to the compensation planning process to consolidate and streamline compensation planning for the Companys employees. As a result of the changes, beginning for fiscal year 2010, equity compensation awards to management employees under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan (except for off-cycle recruiting and retention awards) will be granted as of the first New York Stock Exchange business day in the month of December and will no longer be granted on the first business day of the Companys fiscal year. Accordingly, in the future, stock option grants to management employees (except for recruiting and retention awards) will be made as of the first New York Stock Exchange business day in December and will have an exercise price based on the closing market price of a share of the Companys common stock on such date.
