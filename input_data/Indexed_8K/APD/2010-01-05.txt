On December 10, 2009, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the "Company") filed a Proxy Statement for its 2010 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be held on January 28, 2010. The Company has been requested to provide additional information with respect to its Long Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which shareholders are requested to approve at the Annual Meeting.
On page 10 of the Proxy Statement, the Company disclosed that, as of its fiscal year end, September 30, 2009, 7,208,358 stock options granted under the Plan had been outstanding in excess of six years with a weighted average exercise price of $39.68.

Page 9 of the Proxy Statement discloses that, as of September 30, 2009, 3,629,182 previously authorized shares were still available for awards under the Plan. As also noted, no more than 20% of the shares of Company stock subject to Plan awards granted after fiscal year 2001 can be used for full value awards ("20% limit"). As of September 30, 2009, less than 12% of shares used for Plan awards since 2001 were used for full value awards. Because the 20% limit is cumulative, and less than 20% of shares subject to awards granted since 2001 have been used for full value awards, 2,757,837 of the authorized shares still available for use under the Plan could be used for full value awards under the terms of the Plan.
