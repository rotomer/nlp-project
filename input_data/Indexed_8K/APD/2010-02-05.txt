Strength Across All Distribution Channels
 
Air Products Expects Synergies of $250 Million and Immediate Earnings Accretion
 
 
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (February 5, 2010)  Air Products (NYSE: APD) today announced that it has made an offer to acquire Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) for $60.00 per share in cash. The offer was made in a letter to Airgas Board of Directors yesterday after the CEOs of the two companies had previously discussed Air Products interest in acquiring Airgas and after Air Products had made two written offers, and these offers and Air Products requests to discuss them were rejected by Airgas.
 
At $60.00 per share, the offer provides a 38% premium to Airgas shareholders based on yesterdays closing price of $43.53 and is 18% above Airgas 52-week high. The total value of the transaction is approximately $7.0 billion, including $5.1 billion of equity and $1.9 billon of assumed debt. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Air Products earnings per share on both a GAAP and cash basis, excluding expected one-time costs.
 
Air Products offer fully values Airgas complementary capabilities and attractive long-term prospects. Headquartered in Pennsylvania, the combined company would be the largest industrial gas company in North America and one of the largest in the world, with distinctive strengths across all geographies and in all three distribution channels: packaged gases, liquid bulk and tonnage. A combination of the two companies would be financially and strategically compelling, with substantial cost synergies of $250 million by the end of year two, and the ability to accelerate growth both domestically and internationally by leveraging Airgas extensive U.S. sales force and packaged gases skills on the foundation of Air Products global presence and infrastructure.
 
Air Products is fully committed to pursuing this transaction, and has secured committed financing from J.P. Morgan to complete the offer. Air Products is prepared to make appropriate divestitures to address regulatory issues.
 
John E. McGlade, Air Products chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, This is an extremely compelling transaction with undeniable strategic and industrial logic that would benefit shareholders, customers and employees of both companies. Bringing together these two highly complementary companies would create substantial value. We highly value the talented operating team at Airgas, and believe they would benefit greatly from the expanded opportunities and resources available to them as part of a larger and stronger global U.S. company with significantly greater long-term growth prospects than a stand-alone Airgas. While we are disappointed that Airgas has thus far prevented its shareholders from receiving a substantial premium and immediate liquidity, we have repeatedly communicated to the Airgas Board our willingness to improve our offer to reflect any incremental value they can demonstrate. While it remains our strong desire to reach an agreement with Airgas on a friendly basis, we are fully committed to pursuing this transaction and are prepared to take all necessary steps to complete it, including making an offer directly to Airgas shareholders.

Below is the full text of the most recent letter from Air Products to Airgas:
 
February 4, 2010
 
Mr. Peter McCausland
Chairman, President and CEO
Airgas, Inc.
259 North Radnor-Chester Road, Suite 100
Radnor, PA 19087-5283
 
Dear Peter:
 
As you know, we have been trying for the last four months to engage Airgas in friendly discussions regarding a business combination. We are deeply disappointed that you and your board have rejected out of hand two written offers providing your shareholders substantial premiums. In our prior correspondence, we clearly and repeatedly stated our flexibility as to both value and form of consideration, yet you have continued to refuse even to discuss our offers. Your unwillingness to engage has delayed the ability of your shareholders to receive a substantial premium. We remain committed to completing this transaction, and we have therefore decided to inform your shareholders of our offer to expedite the process.
 
Air Products is prepared to proceed with a fully financed, all-cash offer for all Airgas shares
at $60.00 per share, which reflects a premium of 38% to Airgas closing price today of
$43.53 and 18% above its 52-week high. In addition to a substantial premium, Airgas
shareholders will benefit from immediate liquidity in an uncertain economic environment
through an offer which we believe fully values Airgas complementary capabilities and long-
term growth prospects.

Bringing together our complementary skills and strengths will create one of the worlds leading integrated industrial gas companies. Combining Air Products global leadership in liquid bulk and tonnage gases with Airgas leadership in U.S. packaged gases will create the largest industrial gas company in North America and one of the largest globally  a leader with distinctive strengths and world-class competencies across all distribution channels and geographies. While we have a strong and profitable packaged gas business in Europe and other key international markets, we do not have a position in the U.S. packaged gas business where Airgas is the market leader. As part of this uniquely compelling combination, Airgas would be well positioned to achieve higher growth than it could achieve on a stand-alone basis.
We do not believe there are any significant financial or regulatory impediments to your shareholders timely realization of this substantial cash premium. We have secured committed financing from J.P. Morgan to complete the offer and are committed to maintaining a robust capital structure. We have also thoroughly considered the regulatory issues related to this combination and are prepared to make appropriate divestitures, none of which we expect to be material.
 
The strategic and industrial logic of this combination is clear, and we are confident that an Air Products/Airgas combination would create greater value than Airgas or Air Products could each achieve on its own. There are many advantages to consummating this combination now, including:
 
 
 
We believe the timing for this combination is ideal. The economy is just beginning to emerge from recession, and together we would be able to take full advantage of the substantial growth potential, economies of scale, and synergies unique to this transaction. You have made clear your international growth aspirations, which will require significant time and expense to build out on your own. Air Products has the global infrastructure in place that would allow you to achieve your goals faster and better. Airgas is also just in the initial stages of implementing SAP, and our demonstrated expertise in this area would greatly reduce the time, expense and disruption associated with this vital rollout.
 
Bringing our two companies together would also benefit employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. We highly value the talented operating team at Airgas, which would benefit greatly from the expanded opportunities and resources available as part of a larger and stronger global U.S. company headquartered in Pennsylvania -- with significantly greater long-term growth prospects than a stand-alone Airgas. Your customers would benefit from a more robust product offering from a company with expanded resources and global scope.

Peter, let me reemphasize as I have in past discussions that Air Products is fully committed to the successful completion of this compelling transaction. Your continuing refusal to engage with us will serve only to further delay your shareholders ability to receive a substantial all-cash premium. While we would strongly prefer to proceed through friendly negotiations, you should not doubt our resolve to take the necessary actions to complete this transaction. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you or with any special committee of your independent directors which has been or will be formed to consider our offer, as well as their independent financial and legal advisors. Finally, we reiterate our willingness to reflect in our offer any incremental value you can demonstrate.
 
Very Truly Yours,
 
John E. McGlade
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products), by and through its undersigned attorneys, files this verified complaint (the Complaint) against Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), and Peter McCausland, James W. Hovey, Paula A. Sneed, David M. Stout, Ellen C. Wolf, W. Thacher Brown, Richard C. Ill, Lee M. Thomas and John C. van Roden, Jr. (collectively, the Defendant Directors) upon knowledge as to matters relating to itself and upon information and belief as to all other matters, and alleges as follows:
 
1.           Today, February 4, 2010, Air Products publicly announced a non-discriminatory, all-cash offer (the Proposed Transaction) to purchase all outstanding Airgas shares for $60 per sharea 38% premium to todays closing price of $43.53.  The offer is supported by committed financing.  Air Products is offering Airgass shareholders consideration equal to the full pre-offer market capitalization of Airgas an additional $1.35 billion, all in cash.  Moreover, Air Products has committed to increasing its offer price to reflect any incremental value demonstrated by Airgas and to taking the other steps necessary to close a deal.
plus
 
 
2.           The only obstacles standing between Airgass shareholders and due consideration of this high-premium offer are the shareholders own entrusted fiduciariesthe Defendant Directors.  For months, Air Products has sought to engage the Defendant Directors to present its case for combining Airgass North American packaged gas business with Air Products global tonnage and liquid bulk gas businesses, creating a premier gas company across all geographies and distribution channels.  In its overtures, Air Products has consistently stressed its flexibility on both the price and the form of consideration that Airgass shareholders would receive.  But the Defendant Directorsled by Airgass founder, President, largest shareholder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Peter McCauslandhave refused even to meet with Air Products representatives to investigate and understand the proposal in any detail.  Upon information and belief, this just say no defensive posture is calculated to entrench McCausland as Chief Executive and Chairman and to protect the other Defendant Directors positions in Airgas, at the sacrifice of the unique and valuable opportunity offered to Airgass shareholders.
3.           Air Products brings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the Defendant Directors to fulfill their fiduciary duties.  Air Products is proposing a transaction that is non-coercive, non-discriminatory, backed by committed financing, and priced at a large premium to Airgass pre-offer market value today and its 52-week high.  As such, it is in the best interests of Airgas shareholders for this offer to be, at the very least, considered and negotiated by a special committee of Airgass independent directors advised by independent financial and legal advisors.  The Defendant Directors refusal even to form an independent committee and to discuss the proposal with Air Products constitutes an unreasonable response to Air Products proposal, one that violates the Defendant Directors fiduciary duties under Delaware law.  The Defendant Directors cannot inform themselves concerning, or properly assess, the Air Products proposal, consistent with their duty of care, without meeting with Air Products either directly or through advisors.  The Defendant Directors just say no reflexive response, apparently at the behest of their Chairman, represents a violation of their duty of loyalty to Airgas shareholders.

A.           
The Proposed Transaction Would Fuel Higher Growth
16.           Air Products has been pursuing a business combination with Airgas for approximately four months. Air Products decided to approach Airgas after Air Products management and Board of Directors determined that such a combination would foster growth and shareholder returns superior to those of the respective companies on their own.  A key driver of that assessment, in addition to the combination of world-class competencies and cost synergies, was the highly complementary nature of the two businesses.
 
 
 
4
 
 
17.           Air Products and Airgas are comparatively strong in different areas.  Air Products was founded by the late Leonard P. Pool in 1940 on a simple but revolutionary idea: the concept of on-site production and sales of industrial gases. At the time, gas was sold to even the largest consumers only in cylinders. Pool built gas generating facilities adjacent to large-volume gas users, thereby reducing distribution costs.  Today, Air Products is a leader in the delivery of tonnage gas (, gas delivered via pipeline) and liquid bulk gas (, gas delivered via tanker trucks).  On the other hand, the heart of Airgass businessbuilt through over 400 acquisitionsis the delivery of packaged gas (, gas delivered via small cylinders and dewars) to small-volume industrial, medical, and specialty users.  Combining these two businesses would marry Air Products leading bulk infrastructure, engineering, and low-cost supply with Airgass leading packaged gas distribution and sales systems.  The result: the leading gas company in America, able to offer a wide variety of gas products more efficiently and at lower cost.
i.e.
i.e.
i.e.
18.           Air Products analysis also revealed that the two companies are geographically complementary.  Air Products has invested heavily in producing a world-wide gas infrastructure, to the point that today Air Products earns a majority of its revenue from international sales.  Airgass packaged gas business, on the other hand, is primarily confined to the United States.  Though Airgas has signaled its desire to expand internationally, building out the necessary infrastructure is slow and costly.  A combination with Air Products would immediately provide a preexisting infrastructure for Airgass business to expand.

19.           Air Products concluded that the combined company would:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20.           As a standalone company, Airgass performance has faltered.  On January 28, 2010, Airgas publicly announced its fiscal third quarter results.  The market was surprised by a 25% fall in Airgass earnings from the same quarter last year, which translated to reported earnings lower than the low-end of the earnings guidance Airgas had previously issued.  Airgas also lowered its future earnings targets.
21.           Another benefit arising from the complementary, rather than overlapping, nature of Air Products and Airgass businesses is the mitigation of regulatory concerns.  Before approaching Airgas, Air Products carefully assessed regulatory issues that might arise and determined that any such issues can be addressed through limited, identifiable remedies.  In particular, Air Products concluded that a number of credible buyers exist for businesses and facilities that might be at issue, a conclusion bolstered by the fact that these assets are capable of being operated on a standalone or bolt-on basis. Indeed, the very assets likely to be divested, to a significant extent, have previously been bought and sold between gas companies.  As repeatedly communicated to Airgas, Air Products stands prepared to share the results of its regulatory analyses once representatives from the two companies meet.
 
 
6
 
 
22.           Air Products management is experienced in running packaged gas businesses.  For example, Air Products currently operates a large and successful European packaged gas business and a growing Asian packaged gas business, both of which would serve as platforms for Airgass growth in these areas.  Moreover, Air Products previously operated a packaged gas business in the United States. This business, which at the time held a modest share of domestic sales, and had limited breadth and scope, was sold to Airgas in 2002.  As Air Products representatives explained at that time, rather than invest its capital in building out this mode of supply, the company instead sought to focus on growing its tonnage (particularly hydrogen) and liquid bulk businesses.  With those objectives largely accomplished, a combination with Airgas now would produce a company with first-class competencies across all three modes of supply.
 
 
23.           On October 15, 2009, the Chief Executive Officers of Air Products (John E. McGlade) and Airgas (Peter McCausland) met at Airgass headquarters. McGlade suggested the meeting that week to discuss a business proposal. At the meeting, McGlade indicated that Air Products was interested in pursuing a business combination with Airgas in a stock-for-stock deal that would value Airgas at a substantial premium to its then market price and allow Airgas shareholders to share in the value created by the combination.
24.           McGlade told McCausland that careful study had convinced Air Products managers and directors that joining forces with Airgas would create a premier industrial gas company.  Through geographic and business diversification, cost savings, and highly complementary business capabilities, shareholders of both companies could expect to reap significant additional returns.
 
 
7
 
25.           After hearing McGlades proposal to join ranks, and Air Products rationale behind it, McCausland said that the timing was not right.
26.           In response, McGlade stressed that, in Air Products view, the best time for a transaction was now. Among other reasons: (1) the economy was emerging from a recession, which created a window to integrate the companies and achieve synergies at lower cost; (2) Airgas is just beginning to implement SAP software systemsa notoriously time-consuming and expensive processand Air Products could share its seven years of experience implementing SAP; and (3) Airgas is likely to begin spending capital on an international infrastructure, a costly expense that would be made unnecessary by a merger with Air Products extensive global infrastructure.
27.           Accordingly, McGlade asked McCausland to discuss Air Products proposal with Airgass Board of Directors and signaled his intent to put Air Products offer in writing.  McCausland remained noncommittal but asked that nothing be sent to him in writing.
28.           On October 31, 2009, one week before Airgas was scheduled to hold its Board of Directors annual retreat, McGlade called McCausland to reaffirm Air Products commitment to a transaction and the expectation that the offer would be presented to, and duly considered by, Airgass Board. McCausland responded that he doubted that the Board of Directors would view the proposal differently than he did and again asked that nothing be sent to him in writing.
29.           In early November, the Airgas Board of Directors held its retreat. A few days after the Defendant Directors concluded the multi-day meetings, McCausland returned McGlades call.  Despite the high-premium offer available to Airgass shareholders, McCausland stated that the Defendant Directors had no interest in even exploring the proposal, and rejected the invitation to further discuss it.  Upon information and belief, the Defendant Directors failed even to form a special committee of independent directors with independent advisors to evaluate the offer.  The Defendant Directors rejected the offer as undervalued, despite its high premium to Airgass market price and despite knowing that Airgas was performing below its own guidance to the market.

30.           On November 19, 2009, at a meeting of Air Products directors, McGlade reported on Airgass response to Air Products overture.  The Air Products Board of Directors resolved to authorize McGlade to make a written offer to Airgas.
31.           The next day, McGlade sent a letter to McCausland setting out the basic terms of Air Products offer.  Exhibit A hereto.  Air Products offered to acquire all of Airgass outstanding shares for $60 per share in an all-stock transaction, equivalent to 0.7296 shares of Air Products common stock based on its then-current market price.  That afternoon, Airgass stock closed trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $47.05 per share.  Thus, the offers nearly $13 extra per share represented a premium of 27.5% to the market price of Airgass stock.

32.           In his letter, McGlade reiterated what he had told McCausland orally: that combining Air Products global leadership in liquid bulk and tonnage gases with Airgass leadership in North American packaged gases would unleash faster earnings growth, both domestically and internationally.
33.           McGlade also wrote that Air Products was ready and willing to negotiate with Airgas if Airgas found the offer unsatisfactory. In particular, Air Products has consistently stated that it will share any additional value that Airgas identifies with Airgass shareholders, and the November 20 letter reiterated that point:

34.           In a November 25 letter, McCausland responded to the written offer tersely.  Exhibit B hereto.  McCausland wrote that Airgass Board would meet in early December to consider Air Products offer and that McCausland would contact McGlade after the meeting.
See
35.           On December 8, 2009, McCausland wrote to McGlade that the Defendant Directors had considered Air Products offer and rejected it.  Exhibit C hereto. According to McCausland, the Defendant Directors concluded that Air Products was undervaluing Airgas and that Air Products stock was a currency that [was] not attractive.   at 1.  For those reasons, the Defendant Directors purportedly had no interest in pursuing the possible benefits of such a deal for Airgass shareholders.    Upon information and belief, the offer was not considered by a special committee of independent directors advised by independent advisors.  And the Defendant Directors concluded that Air Products offerdespite its high premium to Airgass market priceundervalued Airgas, despite knowing that Airgass results in the fiscal third quarter would be below market expectations.

36.           The Defendant Directors not only rejected the premium offer, but also flatly stated that they had no interest in even continuing a dialogue between the two companies, despite Air Products stated willingness to modify the terms of its offer in response to any demonstration that there is value in Airgas which Air Products is overlooking.  Instead, McCausland told McGlade that the Defendant Directors do not believe that any purpose would be served by having the companies or their advisors meet.   at 2.  The Defendant Directors did not propose a counter-offer to Air Products original offer or tell Air Products why they value Airgass stock so differently than do the buyers and sellers of Airgass highly liquid stock trading in an efficient market.

37.           Air Products remained committed to pursuing an acquisition of Airgas that would maximize shareholder value and improve the performance of both companies.  In a letter dated December 17, 2009, McGlade informed McCausland that, in a good faith effort to start discussions between the two companies, Air Products was raising its offer to $62 per share.  Exhibit D hereto.  To address the Defendant Directors purported concerns about the attractiveness of Air Products stock, Air Products also offered to fund up to half the purchase in cash. Air Products revised offer now represented a 33% premium to Airgass closing price on the New York Stock Exchange that day.
See
38.           Additionally, McGlade yet again communicated that Air Products would work flexibly with Airgas to reach a mutually acceptable deal, including on price: If you believe that there is incremental value above and beyond our increased offer, we stand willing to listen and to understand your points on value with a view to sharing increased value appropriately with the Airgas shareholders.   at 5.  Believing that a continued exchange of letters could not adequately communicate the details of and rationale for Air Products offer, McGlade requested a meeting among the Boards and advisors of each company as soon as possible to explore additional sources of value in Airgas.

39.           Shortly thereafter, the Defendant Directors again summarily rejected Air Products offer, without a good faith evaluation of its benefits for Airgass shareholders and without any attempt to investigate or negotiate its terms.  Upon information and belief, the Defendant Directors continued to fail to form a special committee of independent directors advised by independent advisors.  Instead, on January 4, 2010, McCausland wrote to inform McGlade that the Defendant Directors had purportedly met and concluded that Air Products was  undervaluing Airgasdespite Airgass flexible offer being set at a large premium.   Exhibit E hereto.  In his letter, McCausland shut down any exploration of this unique opportunity for Airgass shareholders: [T]he Board is not interested in pursuing your companys proposal and continues to believe that there is no reason to meet.

40.           Upon information and belief, the Defendant Directors rejections of Air Products proposals were delivered while they had knowledge that Airgass financial results for the fiscal third quarter (, the quarter ending December 31, 2009) would be disappointing and would cause a drop in the market price of Airgass shares.  This became evident on January 28, 2010, when Airgas publicly announced that its fiscal third quarter earnings were below the lowest range of the earnings guidance it had given to the market, and also lowered its future earnings guidance.
i.e.
 
41.           Since January 4, the Defendant Directors have continued their unreasonable rejections of Air Products offer to Airgass shareholders.  Air Products advisors have called Airgass advisors and reaffirmed Air Products willingness to negotiate.  Through their advisors, the Defendant Directors have continued to refuse engagement.  On February 1, Air Products advisors made one last attempt to persuade the Defendant Directors, through their advisors, to engage in discussions. Airgass legal advisors responded that the Defendant Directors position on a meeting with Air Products had not and would not change. Airgass financial advisors responded that there is a regularly-scheduled meeting of Airgass Board of Directors set for next week, but refused to reveal what date the Board meeting is actually scheduled and gave no indication that the Board would be addressing Air Products repeated proposals.  None of Airgass advisors even suggested a willingness to meet with Air Products or its advisors or to otherwise discuss the possibility of a transaction.

42.           Today, February 4, 2010, Air Products sent a letter to the Defendant Directors reiterating its proposal to combine with Airgas, with the hope that the Defendant Directors will finally begin to fulfill their fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders.   Exhibit F hereto.  Because of the increased costs associated with a non-negotiated deal, and because the current offer is now an all-cash offer with committed financing from J.P. Morgan (which entails additional costs such as financing commitment fees), Air Products is offering $60 per share in cash. The Defendant Directors unreasonable responses to the offer have imposed costs that will be borne by Airgass shareholders unless the Defendant Directors start to put their shareholders first. At $60 per share, a 38% premium to Airgass pre-offer market value, the Proposed Transaction presents Airgass shareholders with a very compelling opportunity.
See
43.           The fact that the offer is now all cash negates any purported concern on the Defendant Directors part as to the value of Air Products shares as currency or as to the future performance of the combined company, unfounded as they may be.  Air Products has thus demonstrated its willingness to be responsive to the Defendant Directors concerns, and in its current offer letter Air Products has reiterated its willingness to engage in good-faith negotiations and to adjust its offer to reflect any incremental value in Airgas that can be demonstrated.
 
 
13
 
44.           Airgas has a Shareholders Rights Plan (poison pill) and has not opted out of 8 Del. C.  203.  A refusal on the part of the Defendant Directors to take appropriate action relating to the poison pill and Section 203 will prevent Airgas shareholders from receiving the benefits of Air Products offer.  The actions of the Defendant Directors thus far, as reported by Mr. McCausland, suggest that the Defendant Directors will refuse to take the appropriate action, and may not form a special committee of independent directors, advised by independent advisors, to consider the Air Products offer and to consider whether to engage in discussions with Air Products.
 
45.           Air Products realleges and reaffirms the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
46.           Air Products has no adequate remedy at law. Only through the exercise of the Courts equitable powers will Air Products and Airgass shareholders be protected from irreparable injury.  Absent equitable relief from the Court, Air Products will be precluded from consummating the Proposed Transaction and Airgass shareholders will be deprived of the opportunity to sell their shares to Air Products at a substantial premium.  Should that occur, Air Products will have lost the unique opportunity to acquire Airgas, and Airgas shareholders will have lost a unique opportunity to maximize value.
 
 
47.           Air Products realleges and reaffirms the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
 
 
14
 
 
48.           The Defendant Directors owe fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders, including the duty to act with due care and the utmost good faith and loyalty.
49.           The Proposed Transaction is all-cash, non-discriminatory, backed by committed financing, and for all of Airgass shares. It is non-coercive and negotiable, is fair to Airgass shareholders, and poses no threat to its corporate policy and effectiveness.  The Proposed Transaction represents a substantial premium (38%) over todays closing price for Airgass common stock.
50.           Peter McCausland, Airgass President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, is not an independent, outside, or disinterested director.  Seeking to entrench himself, he has not recused himself from the Board of Directors responses to Air Products proposals, but has instead dictated them.  The other Defendant Directors, aware of McCauslands interested status, have failed to insist on forming a special committee with independent advisors. Instead, they have sought to entrench themselves and to further McCauslands interests.  The Defendant Directors conduct represents a violation of their duty of loyalty to Airgas shareholders.
51.           The Defendant Directors failed to conduct a good faith and reasonable investigation of the Proposed Transaction. Instead, the Defendant Directors summarily refused to engage Air Products in a meaningful dialogue and failed to reasonably inform themselves about the Proposed Transaction.  The Defendant Directors could not possibly be well informed concerning the offers to which they have just said no without at least engaging in discussion, either directly or through advisors, to learn more about Air Products offer and how flexible Air Products might be in response to any showing of incremental value in Airgas.  This is a violation of the Defendant Directors duty of care.
 
 
15
 
 
52.           The Defendant Directors refusal to negotiate with Air Products deprives Airgass shareholders of the opportunity to sell their Airgas shares at a substantial premium and, accordingly, to maximize the value of their shares in an uncertain economic environment.
53.           The Defendant Directors failure to adequately consider the Proposed Transaction and to negotiate with Air Products has no economic justification, serves no legitimate purpose, is an unreasonable response to the Proposed Transaction, which poses no threat to the interests of Airgass shareholders, and is a violation of the Defendant Directors duty of loyalty.
54.           The Defendant Directors actions are in breach of the fiduciary duties they owe to Airgass shareholders.
55.           The Defendant Directors conduct threatens to deprive Air Products of the unique opportunity to acquire Airgas.
56.           Air Products has no remedy at law.
 
 
57.           Air Products realleges and reaffirms the allegations in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
58.           The Defendant Directors owe fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders, including the duty to act with due care and the utmost good faith and loyalty.
59.           The Proposed Transaction is all-cash, non-discriminatory, backed by committed financing, and for all of Airgass shares. It is non-coercive and negotiable, is fair to Airgass shareholders, and poses no threat to its corporate policy and effectiveness.  Moreover, the Proposed Transaction represents a substantial premium (38%) over todays closing price for Airgass common stock.

60.           Air Products seeks an order declaring that the Defendant Directors fiduciary duties require them to form a special committee of independent directors, advised by independent legal and financial advisors, to investigate, consider and negotiate (without impediments) the Proposed Transaction.
61.           Air Products seeks an order declaring that the adoption, maintenance or implementation of any defensive measures by Defendants against the Proposed Transaction, or of any measure that would prevent a future board of directors from exercising its fiduciary duties, would itself constitute a breach of fiduciary duties owed to Airgass shareholders.
62.           Air Products has no remedy at law.
 
63.           WHEREFORE, Air Products respectfully requests that the Court:
     a)           declare that Defendant Directors have breached their fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders by refusing to negotiate with Air Products and to inform themselves of the potential parameters of the offer, and by failing to form a special committee of independent directors, with independent advisors, to consider and negotiate the offer;
   
    b)           compel the Defendant Directors to form a special committee of Airgass independent directors, with its own independent financial and legal advisors, to reasonably consider and negotiate the Proposed Transaction, in good faith;
   
    c)           enjoin the Defendant Directors from engaging in any action or inaction that has the effect of improperly impeding, thwarting, frustrating or interfering with the Proposed Transaction with Air Products in a manner inconsistent with their fiduciary duties;
   
    d)           enjoin Airgas, its employees, agents and all persons acting on its behalf or in concert with it from taking any action that has the effect of impeding Air Products efforts to acquire control of Airgas, in violation of their respective fiduciary duties to Airgass shareholders;
