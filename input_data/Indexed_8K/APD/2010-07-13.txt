Item 2.03.    Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
 
On July 8, 2010, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a three-year dollar equivalent $2,000,000,000 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the "2010 Credit Agreement"), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The 2010 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. The Company unconditionally guarantees the payment of all loans made under the 2010 Credit Agreement to its subsidiary borrowers. Amounts outstanding under the 2010 Credit Agreement may be accelerated for typical defaults, including the non-payment of amounts due under the 2010 Credit Agreement, the non-payment of material judgments or debt obligations and certain bankruptcy events. The Company's only financial covenant is a maximum ratio of total debt to EBITDA.
The 2010 Credit Agreement terminates and replaces the Company's existing $1,450,000,000 revolving credit agreement dated May 23, 2006, as subsequently amended (the "2006 Agreement"). No borrowings were outstanding under the 2006 Agreement at the time of its termination and no early termination penalties were incurred.
As of the date of this filing, no borrowings have been made and no material direct financial obligations have been created under the 2010 Credit Agreement.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
