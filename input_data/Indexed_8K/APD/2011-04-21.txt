LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. (April 21, 2011)  Air Products (NYSE:APD) today reported net income of $309 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2011. This result excludes a net after-tax cost of $4 million, or $0.02 per share, associated with the now expired tender offer for the outstanding shares of Airgas, Inc.
The discussion of second quarter results and guidance in this release is based on non-GAAP comparisons. A reconciliation can be found at the end of this release.*
Second quarter revenues of $2,501 million grew 11 percent versus prior year, primarily on higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases segments. Sequential sales were up five percent. Operating income of $425 million improved 17 percent versus prior year and five percent sequentially on increased volumes. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 17 percent.
"For the quarter, we had strong growth with double-digit increases in both sales and earnings. This performance, along with our 18 percent dividend increase and $350 million share repurchase, reflects the strength of our business and our belief that shareholders should benefit directly from the improved operating performance of their company," said John McGlade, chairman, president and chief executive officer.

Air Products now expects third quarter EPS to be between $1.42 and $1.47 per share.

(Millions of dollars, unless otherwise indicated)
AIRGAS TRANSACTION
In February 2010, we commenced a tender offer to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas), including the associated preferred stock purchase rights, for $60.00 per share in cash, less any required withholding tax. The offer was subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated 11 February 2010, as amended, including Airgas' redemption of the preferred stock purchase rights or such rights otherwise being inapplicable to our purchase of Airgas stock. Airgas, a Delaware company, is the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, and hard goods. On 9 December 2010, we increased the value of our tender offer to $70.00 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would have been approximately $7.8 billion, including $6.1 billion of equity and $1.7 billion of assumed debt. Based on a decision by the Delaware Chancery Court to uphold the decision of Airgas' board of directors to retain the preferred stock purchase rights, we withdrew our offer on 15 February 2011.
In connection with the tender offer, we had secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. On 3 February 2011, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for an amended $6.7 billion term loan credit facility with a maturity date of 4 June 2011. No additional underwriting fees were incurred in relation to the amended agreement. On 16 February 2011, in connection with the termination of the offer to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of Airgas, the credit facility was terminated. No early termination penalties were incurred and all fees previously accrued and due under the credit facility were paid as of the date of termination.
Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share).
For the three and six months ended 31 March 2011, a net loss of $5.0 ($4.4 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share), respectively, was recognized related to this transaction. These amounts are reflected separately on the consolidated income statement within "Net loss on Airgas transaction" and include amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock and other acquisition-related costs. For the six months ended 31 March 2011 and 2010, cash payments for the acquisition-related costs were $153.8 and $2.4, respectively. These payments are classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
 
 
 
We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
Below is a reconciliation of capital expenditures on a GAAP basis to a non-GAAP measure.
