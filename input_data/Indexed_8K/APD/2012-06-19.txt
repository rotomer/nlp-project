Strategy for Success Growing in Latin America: Indura & Air Products June 19 2012
Forward looking statement This presentation contains "forward-looking statements" within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about growth, projections, and business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management's reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, deterioration in Latin American economic and business conditions; weakening demand for the Company's products; future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company in Latin America; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the success of commercial negotiations; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; market acceptance of the products and applications; achieving anticipated acquisition synergies; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources for the Company's Latin American operations; the impact of environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and regulations; the impact of new or changed financial accounting guidance; and other risk factors described in the Company's Form 10K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2011. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company's assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.
