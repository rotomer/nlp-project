Exhibit 99.1
        Wallingford, Connecticut. April 16, 2003. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 35% to $.54 compared to $.40 per share for the 2002 period. Sales for the first quarter 2003 increased 9% to $277,774,000 compared to $255,976,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.8 million in the first quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
        Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results. Sales were up 9% compared to last year's first quarter. The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 89% of our sales, was up a strong 15% over last year, and the growth was broad based across substantially all of our major end markets and all major geographic regions. The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our presence with the leading OEM's in our target markets. The coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks portion of our business, which represents 11% of our sales, was down from last year as both domestic and international cable operators have curtailed their capital spending for network upgrades and expansion. In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Our operating income margin was 16.3% and cash flow from operations was $35.8 million. As previously announced, we are pursuing a refinancing of our senior credit facilities which, when completed, will include a redemption of our senior subordinated notes. Such refinancing will extend the maturity dates of principal in comparison to our current loan agreements. In addition, in late March we completed the acquisition of Insilco Holding Company's custom assembly business."
        "Notwithstanding the excellent first quarter results, the overall economic climate is uncertain and it continues to be difficult forecasting future results. I believe we are well established with leading positions in excellent and diversified markets, and we continue to increase our presence with major OEM's in these markets. However, the timing and strength of a general economic recovery is the uncertainty. Assuming a reasonable and stable economic climate and given the excellent first quarter results, I have increased confidence in achieving our earlier outlook of a 4-7% increase in revenues and a 20-25% increase in EPS (excluding debt refinancing costs) in 2003."
        The Company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results at 1:00 PM (EST) April 16, 2003.
