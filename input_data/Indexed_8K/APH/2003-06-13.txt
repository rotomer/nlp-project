The original amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment is $20,000,000; PROVIDED that any reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments made pursuant to subsection 2.4B(ii) that reduces the aggregate Revolving Loan Commitments to an amount less than the then current amount of the Swing Line Loan Commitment shall result in an automatic corresponding reduction of the Swing Line Loan Commitment to the amount of the Revolving Loan Commitments, as so reduced, without any further action on the part of Company, Administrative Agent or Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Loan Commitment shall expire on the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date and all Swing Line Loans and all other amounts owed hereunder with respect to the Swing Line Loans shall be paid in full no later than that date. Amounts borrowed under this subsection 2.1A(iv) may be repaid and reborrowed to but excluding the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Swing Line Loans and the Swing Line Loan Commitment shall be subject to the limitation that in no event shall the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect. (b) SWING LINE LOAN PREPAYMENT WITH PROCEEDS OF REVOLVING LOANS. With respect to any Swing Line Loans that have not been voluntarily prepaid by Company pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i), Swing Line Lender may, at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, deliver to Administrative Agent 35
(with a copy to Company), no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the first Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date, a notice (which shall be deemed to be a Notice of Borrowing given by Company) requesting Revolving Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on such Funding Date in an amount equal to the amount of such Swing Line Loans (the "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOANS") outstanding on the date such notice is given which Swing Line Lender requests Revolving Lenders to prepay. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the proceeds of such Revolving Loans made by Revolving Lenders other than Swing Line Lender shall be immediately delivered by Administrative Agent to Swing Line Lender (and not to Company) and applied to repay a corresponding portion of the Refunded Swing Line Loans and (ii) on the day such Revolving Loans are made, Swing Line Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Refunded Swing Line Loans shall be deemed to be paid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan made by Swing Line Lender, and such portion of the Swing Line Loans deemed to be so paid shall no longer be outstanding as Swing Line Loans and shall no longer be due under the Swing Line Note, if any, of Swing Line Lender but shall instead constitute part of Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Loans and shall be due under the Revolving Note, if any, of Swing Line Lender. If any portion of any such amount paid (or deemed to be paid) to Swing Line Lender should be recovered by or on behalf of Company from Swing Line Lender in bankruptcy, by assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among all Lenders in the manner contemplated by subsection 10.5. (c) SWING LINE LOAN ASSIGNMENTS. If for any reason (1) Revolving Loans are not made upon the request of Swing Line Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph in an amount sufficient to repay any amounts owed to Swing Line Lender in respect of any outstanding Swing Line Loans or (2) the Revolving Loan Commitments are terminated at a time when any Swing Line Loans are outstanding, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have purchased a participation in such outstanding Swing Line Loans in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share (calculated immediately prior to such termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments) of the unpaid amount of such Swing Line Loans together with accrued interest thereon. Upon one Business Day's notice from Swing Line Lender, each Revolving Lender shall deliver to Swing Line Lender an amount equal to its respective participation in same day funds at the Funding and Payment Office. In order to further evidence such participation (and without prejudice to the effectiveness of the participation provisions set forth above), each Revolving Lender agrees to enter into a separate participation agreement at the request of Swing Line Lender in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Revolving Lender and Swing Line Lender. In the event any Revolving Lender fails to make available to Swing Line Lender the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation as provided in this paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on 36
demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. In the event Swing Line Lender receives a payment of any amount in which other Revolving Lenders have purchased participations as provided in this paragraph, Swing Line Lender shall promptly distribute to each such other Revolving Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans pursuant to the second preceding paragraph and each Revolving Lender's obligation to purchase a participation in any unpaid Swing Line Loans pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Lender may have against Swing Line Lender, Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or a Potential Event of Default; (c) any adverse change in the business, operations, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (d) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any party thereto; or (e) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; PROVIDED that such obligations of each Revolving Lender are subject to the condition that (X) Swing Line Lender believed in good faith that all conditions under Section 4 to the making of the applicable Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans, as the case may be, were satisfied at the time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or unpaid Swing Line Loans were made or (Y) the satisfaction of any such condition not satisfied had been waived in accordance with subsection 10.6 prior to or at the time such Refunded Swing Line Loans or other unpaid Swing Line Loans were made. B. BORROWING MECHANICS. Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans or Revolving Loans (other than Revolving Loans made pursuant to a request by Swing Line Lender pursuant to subsection 2.1A(iv) for the purpose of repaying any Refunded Swing Line Loans or Revolving Loans made pursuant to subsection 3.3B for the purpose of reimbursing any Issuing Lender for the amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it) made on any Funding Date shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount. Swing Line Loans made on any Funding Date shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess of that amount. Whenever Company desires that Lenders make Term Loans or Revolving Loans to Company it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a duly executed Notice of Borrowing no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a LIBOR Loan) or at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed Funding Date (in the case of a Base Rate Loan). Whenever Company desires that Swing Line Lender make a Swing Line Loan, it shall deliver to Administrative Agent a Notice of Borrowing no later than 1:00 P.M.

Term Loans and Revolving Loans may be continued as or converted into Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans in the manner provided in subsection 2.2D. In lieu of delivering the above-described Notice of Borrowing, Company may give Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed borrowing under this subsection 2.1B; PROVIDED that such notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a duly executed Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent on or before the applicable Funding Date. Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized to borrow on behalf of Company or for otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.1B, and upon funding of Loans by Lenders in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic notice, Company shall have effected Loans hereunder. Company shall notify Administrative Agent prior to the funding of any Loans in the event that any of the matters to which Company is required to certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing is no longer true and correct as of the applicable Funding Date, and the acceptance by Company of the proceeds of any Loans shall constitute a re-certification by Company, as of the applicable Funding Date, as to matters to which Company are required to certify in the applicable Notice of Borrowing. C. DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS. All Term Loans and Revolving Loans under this Agreement shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in that other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder nor shall the Commitment of any Lender to make the particular Type of Loan requested be increased or decreased as a result of a default by any other Lender in that other Lender's obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder. Promptly after receipt by Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to subsection 2.1B (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof), Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, of the proposed borrowing. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Funding Date, and Swing Line Lender shall make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the applicable Funding Date, in each case in same day funds in 38
Dollars, at the Funding and Payment Office. Except as provided in subsection 2.1A(iv) or subsection 3.3B with respect to Revolving Loans used to repay Refunded Swing Line Loans or to reimburse any Issuing Lender for the amount of a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent specified in subsections 4.1 (in the case of Loans made on the Closing Date) and 4.2 (in the case of all Loans), Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Loans available to Company on the applicable Funding Date by causing an amount of same day funds in Dollars equal to the proceeds of all such Loans received by Administrative Agent from Lenders or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be, to be credited to the account of Company at the Funding and Payment Office. Unless Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the Funding Date for any Loans that such Lender does not intend to make available to Administrative Agent the amount of such Lender's Loan requested on such Funding Date, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to Administrative Agent on such Funding Date and Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, make available to Company a corresponding amount on such Funding Date. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Administrative Agent by such Lender, Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon Administrative Agent's demand therefor, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Company, and Company shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to Administrative Agent together with interest thereon, for each day from such Funding Date until the date such amount is paid to Administrative Agent, at the rate payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans. Nothing in this subsection 2.1C shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Company may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder. D. THE REGISTER. (i) Administrative Agent shall maintain, at its address referred to in subsection 10.7, a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of Lenders and the Commitments and Loans (whether or not separately evidenced by one or more Notes) of each Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER").

Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Company and each Lender, absent clearly demonstrable error; PROVIDED that failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans. (iii) Each Lender shall record on its internal records (including any Notes held by such Lender) the amount of each Tranche A Term Loan, Tranche B Term Loan, and Revolving Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on Company, absent clearly demonstrable error; PROVIDED that failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect any Lender's Commitments or Company's Obligations in respect of any applicable Loans; and PROVIDED, FURTHER that in the event of any inconsistency between the Register and any Lender's records, the recordations in the Register shall govern. (iv) Company, Administrative Agent and Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed as Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments and Loans listed therein for all purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Commitment or Loan shall be effective, in each case unless and until an Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been accepted by Administrative Agent and recorded in the Register as provided in subsection 10.1B(ii).

B. INTEREST PERIODS. In connection with each LIBOR Loan, Company may, pursuant to the applicable Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, select an interest period (each an "INTEREST PERIOD") to be applicable to such Loan, which Interest Period shall be, at Company's option, either a one, two, three or six month period or, if deposits in the London interbank market are generally available for such 41

Company shall deliver a duly executed Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Administrative Agent no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) at least one Business Day in advance of the proposed conversion date (in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan) and at least three Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date (in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan). A Notice of Conversion/Continuation shall specify (i) the proposed conversion/continuation date (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the amount and type of the Loan to be converted/continued, (iii) the nature of the proposed conversion/continuation, (iv) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan, the requested Interest Period, and (v) in the case of a conversion to, or a continuation of, a LIBOR Loan, that no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; PROVIDED however, that during the Delayed Draw Term B Loan Period, Company may only request Tranche B Term Loans be converted to or continued as Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans with an Interest Period of one month (unless Administrative Agent shall, in its sole discretion, otherwise consent).

Upon receipt of written or telephonic notice of any proposed conversion/continuation under this subsection 2.2D, Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit such notice by telefacsimile or telephone to each Lender. 43
Neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall incur any liability to Company in acting upon any telephonic notice referred to above that Administrative Agent believes in good faith to have been given by a duly authorized officer or other person authorized to act on behalf of Company or for otherwise acting in good faith under this subsection 2.2D, and upon conversion or continuation of the applicable basis for determining the interest rate with respect to any Loans in accordance with this Agreement pursuant to any such telephonic notice, Company shall have effected a conversion or continuation, as the case may be, hereunder. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2.6B, 2.6C and 2.6F, a Notice of Conversion/Continuation for conversion to, or continuation of, a LIBOR Loan (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and Company shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith. E. POST-MATURITY INTEREST. Any principal payments on the Loans not paid when due and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans or any fees or other amounts owed hereunder not paid when due, in each case whether at stated maturity, by notice of prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise, shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws) payable on demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement for Base Rate Loans of the applicable Type (any such fees and other amounts being deemed for such purposes to bear interest on the same basis as Revolving Loans). Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this subsection 2.2E is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Administrative Agent or any Lender. F. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Loans shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Prime Rate, on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year, as the case may be and (ii) in the case of LIBOR Loans and Base Rate Loans bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the Federal Funds Effective Rate, on the basis of a 360-day year, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a LIBOR Loan, the date of conversion of such LIBOR Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a LIBOR Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such LIBOR Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; PROVIDED that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day's interest shall be paid on that Loan. 2.3 FEES.

Company may, upon not less than three Business Days' prior written or telephonic notice confirmed in writing to Administrative Agent (which original written or telephonic notice Administrative Agent will promptly transmit by telefacsimile or telephone to each Revolving Lender), at any time and from time to time terminate in whole or permanently reduce in part, without premium or penalty, the Revolving Loan Commitments in an amount up to the amount by which the Revolving Loan 47
Commitments exceed the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments at the time of such proposed termination or reduction; PROVIDED that any such partial reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess of that amount. Company's notice to Administrative Agent shall designate the date (which shall be a Business Day) of such termination or reduction and the amount of any partial reduction, and such termination or reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments shall be effective on the date specified in Company's notice and shall reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Revolving Lender proportionately to its Pro Rata Share. (iii) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

No later than the fifth Business Day following the date on which any Net Asset Sale Proceeds become Unreinvested Asset Sale Proceeds, Company shall prepay its outstanding Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Unreinvested Asset Sale Proceeds; PROVIDED that, Company may in its sole discretion elect, pursuant to a written notice given by Company to Administrative Agent describing such election, to postpone any mandatory prepayments otherwise required to be made by Company pursuant to this subsection 2.4B(iii)(a) (any such prepayment, until the time actually made, being "POSTPONED PREPAYMENTS") until such time as the aggregate amount of Postponed Prepayments equals $5,000,000. (b) PREPAYMENTS FROM CONSOLIDATED EXCESS CASH FLOW. In the event that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio shall be equal to or greater than 3.25:1.00 as of the last day of any Fiscal Year (commencing with Fiscal Year ending December 31, 2003) and (ii) there shall be Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year, Company shall, no later than the date on which Company is required to deliver audited financial statements with respect to such Fiscal Year pursuant to subsection 6.1(ii), prepay its outstanding Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of such Consolidated Excess Cash Flow (the remaining 50% of such Consolidated Excess Cash Flow being "RETAINED EXCESS CASH FLOW"). (c) PREPAYMENTS AND REDUCTIONS DUE TO ISSUANCE OF INDEBTEDNESS. On the date of receipt of the Net Indebtedness Proceeds from the issuance of any Indebtedness of Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, other than Indebtedness permitted pursuant to subsection 7.1, Company shall prepay the outstanding Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Net Indebtedness Proceeds. 48
(d) PREPAYMENTS FROM THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FACILITY. At any time that the Accounts Receivable Facility Amount for all Accounts Receivable Facilities is increased to an amount greater than the highest aggregate Accounts Receivable Facility Amount prior thereto and is increased to an amount greater than $100,000,000 in the aggregate (such amount, the "EXCESS AMOUNT"), Company shall apply such Excess Amount to prepay the Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to such Excess Amount. (e) PREPAYMENTS DUE TO REDUCTIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS. Company shall from time to time prepay FIRST the Swing Line Loans and SECOND the Revolving Loans to the extent necessary so that the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments shall not at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments then in effect. (iv) Application of Prepayments. (a) APPLICATION OF VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS BY TYPE OF LOANS AND ORDER OF MATURITY. Any voluntary prepayments pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied as specified by Company in the applicable notice of prepayment; PROVIDED that in the event Company fails to specify the Loans of Company to which any such prepayment shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied FIRST to repay outstanding Swing Line Loans to the full extent thereof, SECOND to repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof, and THIRD to repay outstanding Term Loans to the full extent thereof. Any voluntary prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall be applied to prepay the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans in the manner specified by Company and to reduce the scheduled installments of principal of the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans set forth in subsections 2.4A(i) and/or 2.4A(ii), as the case may be, in such order as Company shall direct. (b) APPLICATION OF MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF TERM LOANS TO TRANCHE A TERM LOANS AND TRANCHE B TERM LOANS AND THE SCHEDULED INSTALLMENTS OF PRINCIPAL THEREOF. Any mandatory prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii) shall be applied to prepay the Tranche A Term Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the respective outstanding principal amounts thereof). Any mandatory prepayment of the Tranche A Term Loans or the Tranche B Term Loans shall be applied FIRST to reduce the next two succeeding scheduled installments of principal of the Tranche A Term Loans or the Tranche B Term Loans, as the case may be, set forth in subsection 2.4A(i) or 2.4A(ii), respectively, that are unpaid at the time of such prepayment in the forward order of maturity and SECOND to reduce each remaining unpaid scheduled installment of principal of the Tranche A Term Loans or the Tranche B Term Loans, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof). 49
(c) WAIVER OF CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, so long as any Tranche A Term Loans are outstanding, in the event Company is required to make any mandatory prepayment (a "WAIVABLE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT") of the Tranche B Term Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii), (V) Company may, by written or telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) given to Administrative Agent not less than five Business Days prior to the date (the "REQUIRED PREPAYMENT DATE") on which Company is required to make such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment, elect to offer each Lender holding an outstanding Tranche B Term Loan the option to refuse such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment, (W) in the event Company gives such notice to Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent will promptly notify each such Lender of the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Waivable Mandatory Prepayment and such Lender's option to refuse such amount, (X) each such Lender may exercise such option by giving written notice to Company and Administrative Agent of its election to do so on or before the first Business Day (the "CUTOFF DATE") prior to the Required Prepayment Date, (Y) on the Required Prepayment Date, Company shall pay to Administrative Agent an amount equal to the sum of (1) that portion of the Waivable Mandatory Prepayment payable to those Lenders that have elected not to exercise such option (it being understood that any Lender which does not notify Company and Administrative Agent of its election to exercise such option on or before the Cutoff Date shall be deemed to have elected, as of the Cutoff Date, not to exercise such option), which amount shall be applied to prepay the Tranche B Term Loans of such Lenders in accordance with subsection 2.4B(iv)(b) PLUS (2) 50% of that portion (the "WAIVED PORTION") of the Waivable Mandatory Prepayment otherwise payable to those Lenders that have elected to exercise such option, which amount shall be applied to prepay the Tranche A Term Loans in the same manner as voluntary prepayments of the Tranche A Term Loans are applied pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iv)(a), and (Z) Company shall be entitled to retain the remaining 50% of the Waived Portion (such amount being a "RETAINED PREPAYMENT") to be used for general corporate purposes. (d) APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS TO BASE RATE LOANS AND LIBOR LOANS; OPTION TO DEFER CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LIBOR LOANS. Considering Tranche A Term Loans, Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans being prepaid separately, any prepayment thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the full extent thereof before application to LIBOR Loans, in each case in a manner which minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by Company pursuant to subsection 2.6D; provided that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that (1) the application of any mandatory prepayment pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii) in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4B(iv) would result in the prepayment of all or any portion of a LIBOR Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (2) the remaining term of such Interest Period is less than three 50
months, and (3) no Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Company shall have the option, by giving written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of its election to do so on or before the first Business Day prior to the date on which such prepayment would otherwise be required to be made, to defer the making of such prepayment until the last day of such Interest Period or such earlier date as Company may specify in such notice. C. GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS. (i) MANNER AND TIME OF PAYMENT. All payments by Company of principal, interest, fees and other Obligations hereunder and under the Notes shall be made in Dollars in same day funds, without defense, setoff or counterclaim, free of any restriction or condition, and delivered to Administrative Agent not later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time), on the date due at the Funding and Payment Office for the account of Lenders; funds received by Administrative Agent after that time on such due date shall be deemed to have been paid by Company on the next succeeding Business Day. (ii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS TO PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. Except as provided in subsection 2.2C, all payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan shall include payment of accrued interest on the principal amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest before application to principal. (iii) APPORTIONMENT OF PAYMENTS. Aggregate principal and interest payments in respect of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be apportioned among all outstanding Loans to which such payments relate, in each case proportionately to Lenders' respective Pro Rata Shares. Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, at its Lending Office or at such other address as such Lender may request, its Pro Rata Share of all such payments received by Administrative Agent and the commitment fees of such Lender when received by Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection 2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection 2.4C(iii), if, pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2.6C, any Notice of Conversion/Continuation is withdrawn as to any Affected Lender or if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of its Pro Rata Share of any LIBOR Loans, Administrative Agent shall give effect thereto in apportioning payments received thereafter. (iv) PAYMENTS ON BUSINESS DAYS. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of interest hereunder or of the commitment fees hereunder, as the case may be. 51
D. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTIES. (i) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLATERAL. Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds received by Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral under any Collateral Document may, in the discretion of Collateral Agent, be held by Collateral Agent as Collateral for, and/or (then or at any time thereafter) applied in full or in part by Collateral Agent against, the applicable Secured Obligations (as defined in such Collateral Document) in the following order of priority: (a) To the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, including reasonable compensation to Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and all other expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Collateral Agent in connection therewith, and all amounts for which Collateral Agent is entitled to indemnification under such Collateral Document and all advances made by Collateral Agent thereunder for the account of the applicable Loan Party, and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by Collateral Agent in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy under such Collateral Document, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Collateral Document; (b) thereafter, to the extent of any excess such proceeds, to the payment of all other such Secured Obligations for the ratable benefit of the holders thereof; and (c) thereafter, to the extent of any excess such proceeds, to the payment to or upon the order of such Loan Party or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. (ii) APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTIES. All payments received by Collateral Agent under the Guaranties shall be applied promptly from time to time by Collateral Agent in the following order of priority: (a) To the payment of the costs and expenses of any collection or other realization under the Guaranties, including reasonable compensation to Collateral Agent and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Collateral Agent in connection therewith, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such Guaranty; (b) thereafter, to the extent of any excess such payments, to the payment of all other Guarantied Obligations (as defined in such Guaranty) for the ratable benefit of the holders thereof; and (c) thereafter, to the extent of any excess such payments, to the payment to the applicable Guarantor or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. 52

The proceeds of any Revolving Loans and any Swing Line Loans shall be applied by Company for general corporate purposes. C. DELAYED DRAW TERM B LOANS. The proceeds of any Delayed Draw Term B Loans shall be used to fund Financing Requirements not funded on the Closing Date. 2.6 SPECIAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING LIBOR LOANS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall govern with respect to LIBOR Loans as to the matters covered: A. DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. As soon as practicable after 10:00 A.M. (New York City time), on each Interest Rate Determination Date, Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to LIBOR Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender. B. INABILITY TO DETERMINE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE. In the event that Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any LIBOR Loans, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to such Loans on the basis provided for in the definition of LIBOR, Administrative Agent shall on such date give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and each Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, LIBOR Loans until such time as Administrative Agent notifies Company and Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (which notice Administrative Agent shall give at such time as such circumstances no longer exist) and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company. C. ILLEGALITY OR IMPRACTICABILITY OF LIBOR LOANS. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have reasonably determined (which determination shall be made only after consultation with Company and Administrative Agent, it being understood that any such determination so made shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its LIBOR Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law 53
even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or (ii) has become impracticable as a result of contingencies occurring after the date of this Agreement which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market then, and in any such event, such Lender shall be an "AFFECTED LENDER" and it shall on that day give notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Company and Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Thereafter (a) the obligation of the Affected Lender to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall be withdrawn by the Affected Lender, (b) to the extent such determination by the Affected Lender relates to a LIBOR Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, the Affected Lender shall make such Loan as (or convert such Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan, (c) the Affected Lender's obligation to maintain its outstanding LIBOR Loans (the "AFFECTED LOANS") shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by law, and (d) any Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender as described above relates to a LIBOR Loan then being requested by Company pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation, Company shall have the option, subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, to rescind such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation as to all Lenders by giving notice (by telefacsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to Administrative Agent of such rescission on the date on which the Affected Lender gives notice of its determination as described above (which notice of rescission Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this subsection 2.6C shall affect the obligation of any Lender other than an Affected Lender to make or maintain Loans as, or to convert Loans to, LIBOR Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. D. COMPENSATION FOR BREAKAGE OR NON-COMMENCEMENT OF INTEREST PERIODS. Company shall compensate each Lender, upon written request by that Lender (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such amounts), for all reasonable losses, costs and expenses sustained by that Lender (including losses, costs and expenses actually sustained by that Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by it to make or carry the subject LIBOR Loans but excluding any loss of anticipated profits): (i) if for any reason (other than a default by that Lender or Administrative Agent) a borrowing of any LIBOR Loan by Company does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any LIBOR Loan by Company does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Conversion/Continuation or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation, (ii) if any prepayment (including any prepayment pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i)) or other principal payment or any conversion of Company's LIBOR Loans occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Loan, or (iii) if any prepayment of Company's LIBOR Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by Company. 54
E. BOOKING OF LIBOR LOANS. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer LIBOR Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of that Lender. F. LIBOR LOANS AFTER DEFAULT. If, after the occurrence of and during the continuation of a Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default, Administrative Agent or Requisite Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit the making or continuation of any Loans as, or the conversion of any Loans to, LIBOR Loans and Administrative Agent has so notified Company in writing (i) Company may not elect to have any Loans be made as or converted to LIBOR Loans or elect to have any outstanding LIBOR Loans continued as such after the expiration of the Interest Periods then in effect for such LIBOR Loans and (ii) subject to the provisions of subsection 2.6D, any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by Company with respect to a requested borrowing or conversion/continuation in respect of LIBOR Loans that has not yet occurred shall be deemed to be rescinded by Company. 2.7 INCREASED COSTS; TAXES; CAPITAL ADEQUACY. A. COMPENSATION FOR INCREASED COSTS AND TAXES. Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Lender shall reasonably determine (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the introduction or adoption (after the Closing Date) of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or that any change (after the Closing Date) in any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, or that any determination (after the Closing Date) by a court or governmental authority, or that compliance by such Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made (after the Closing Date) by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), in any such case: (i) subjects such Lender (or its Lending Office) to any additional Tax (excluding (x) any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender and (y) any Tax imposed on any Agent or any Lender as result of a present or former connection between the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and such Lender (except a present connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced any Loan Documents)) with respect to this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder or any payments to such Lender (or its Lending Office) of principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder (any such non-excluded Tax, a "NON-EXCLUDED TAX"); (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender; or 55
(iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Lender (or its Lending Office) or its obligations hereunder or the London interbank market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or maintaining its Loans or Commitments or agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or its Lending Office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, Company shall pay to such Lender, promptly after receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its reasonable discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Lender under this subsection 2.7A, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent clearly demonstrable error. B. WITHHOLDING OF TAXES. (i) PAYMENTS TO BE FREE AND CLEAR. All sums payable by Company under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Non-Excluded Tax imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States of America or any political subdivision in or of the United States of America or any other jurisdiction from or to which a payment is made by or on behalf of Company or by any federation or organization of which the United States of America or any such jurisdiction is a member at the time of payment. (ii) GROSSING-UP OF PAYMENTS. If Company or any other Person is required by law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any such Non-Excluded Tax from any sum paid or payable by Company to Administrative Agent or any Lender under any of the Loan Documents: (a) Company shall notify Administrative Agent of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as Company becomes aware of it; (b) Company shall pay any such Non-Excluded Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be made (if the liability to pay is imposed on Company) for its own account or (if that liability is imposed on Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be) on behalf of and in the name of Administrative Agent or such Lender; (c) the sum payable by Company in respect of which the relevant deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the extent 56
necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or payment, Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction, withholding or payment been required or made; and (d) within 30 days after paying any sum from which it is required by law to make any deduction or withholding, and within 30 days after the due date of payment of any Non-Excluded Tax which it is required by clause (b) above to pay, Company shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence satisfactory to the other affected parties of such deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority; PROVIDED that no such additional amount shall be required to be paid to any Lender under clause (c) above except to the extent that any change after the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or after the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender) in any such requirement for a deduction, withholding or payment as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such deduction, withholding or payment from that in effect at the date of this Agreement or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender. (iii) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax. (a) Each Lender that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state or other political subdivision thereof (for purposes of this subsection 2.7B(iii), a "NON-US LENDER") shall deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of Company or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (1) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI (or any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, or, in the case of a Non-US Lender claiming exemption from United States federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a form W-8BEN, and, in the case of a Lender that has certified in writing to Administrative Agent that it is not a "bank" (as defined in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code), a certificate of such Lender certifying that such Lender is not (i) a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) a ten-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code) of Company or (iii) a controlled foreign corporation related to Company (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code) in each case together with any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued 57
thereunder to establish that such Lender is not subject to United States withholding tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of interest payable under any of the Loan Documents. (b) Each Non-US Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to Administrative Agent and to Company, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof), on or prior to the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), or on such later date when such Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times as may be necessary in the determination of Company or Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (1) two original copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender under subsection 2.7B(iii)(a), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to United States withholding tax, and (2) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any information, if any, such Lender is required to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations issued thereunder, to establish that such Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Lender. (c) Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) and (b) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to Administrative Agent for transmission to Company two new original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents or (2) notify Administrative Agent and Company of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence. (d) Company shall not be required to pay any additional amount to any Non-US Lender under clause (c) of subsection 2.7B(ii) (1) with respect to any Tax required to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, 58
certificates or statements of exemption such Lender is required to transmit with an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY pursuant to subsection 2.7B(iii)(b)(2) or (2) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the requirements of clause (a), (b) or (c)(1) of this subsection 2.7B(iii); PROVIDED that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of subsection 2.7B(iii)(a) on the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof) or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), nothing in this subsection 2.7B(iii)(d) shall relieve Company of its obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to clause (c) of subsection 2.7B(ii) in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to withholding as described in subsection 2.7B(iii)(a). C. CAPITAL ADEQUACY ADJUSTMENT. If any Lender shall have determined that the introduction or adoption (after the Closing Date) of any law, rule or regulation (or any provision thereof) regarding capital adequacy, or that any change (after the Closing Date) therein or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or that compliance by any Lender (or its Lending Office) with any guideline, request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) introduced or adopted (after the Closing Date) by any such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, in any such case has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender's Loans or Commitments or Letters of Credit or participations therein or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such introduction, adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with regard to capital adequacy), then from time to time, promptly after receipt by Company from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, Company shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation for such reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent clearly demonstrable error. 2.8 NOTICE OF CERTAIN COSTS; OBLIGATION OF LENDERS AND ISSUING LENDERS TO MITIGATE. A. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 3.6 requires any Lender or Issuing Lender to give notice to Company of an event or a condition that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 3.6, as the case may be, in the event such 59
notice is given by such Lender or Issuing Lender more than 180 days after such Lender or Issuing Lender has knowledge of the occurrence or existence of such event or circumstance, such Lender or Issuing Lender shall not be entitled to receive any such payments under subsection 2.6, 2.7 or 3.6, as the case may be, in respect of the period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given to Company. B. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees that, if an event occurs or a condition arises that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender or Issuing Lender to receive payments under subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6, it will, if so requested by Company, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to (i) make, issue, fund or maintain the Commitments of such Lender or the affected Loans or Letters of Credit (or participations therein) of such Lender or Issuing Lender through another lending or letter of credit office of such Lender or Issuing Lender or (ii) take such other measures as such Lender or Issuing Lender may deem reasonable in good faith, if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to such Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 would be materially reduced and if the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit (or participations therein) through such other lending or letter of credit office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise materially adversely affect such Commitments or Loans or Letters of Credit (or participations therein) or cause such Lender or Issuing Lender to suffer any economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; PROVIDED that nothing in this subsection 2.8 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of Company or the rights of any Lender provided in subsection 2.6C, 2.7 or 3.6. 2.9 DEFAULTING LENDERS. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that any Lender (a "DEFAULTING LENDER") defaults (a "FUNDING DEFAULT") in its obligation to fund any Revolving Loan (a "DEFAULTED REVOLVING LOAN") in accordance with subsection 2.1 as a result of the appointment of a receiver or conservator with respect to such Lender at the direction or request of any regulatory agency or authority, then (i) during any Default Period (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender" for purposes of voting on any matters (including the granting of any consents or waivers) with respect to any of the Loan Documents, (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, until such time as the Default Excess (as defined below) with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero, (a) any voluntary prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(i) shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such voluntary prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders as if such Defaulting Lender had no Revolving Loans outstanding and the Revolving Loan Exposure of such Defaulting Lender were zero, and (b) any mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iii) shall, if Company so directs at the time of making such mandatory prepayment, be applied to the Revolving Loans of other Lenders (but not to the Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender) as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender, it being understood and agreed that Company shall be entitled to retain any portion of any 60
mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Loans that is not paid to such Defaulting Lender solely as a result of the operation of the provisions of this clause (b), (iii) such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans and such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Usage shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the commitment fee payable to Lenders pursuant to subsection 2.3A in respect of any day during any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to subsection 2.3A with respect to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment in respect of any Default Period with respect to such Defaulting Lender, and (iv) the Total Utilization of Revolving Loan Commitments as at any date of determination shall be calculated as if such Defaulting Lender had funded all Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender. For purposes of this Agreement, (I) "DEFAULT PERIOD" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the period commencing on the date of the applicable Funding Default and ending on the earliest of the following dates: (A) the date on which all Revolving Loan Commitments are cancelled or terminated and/or the Obligations are declared or become immediately due and payable, (B) the date on which (1) the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender shall have been reduced to zero (whether by the funding by such Defaulting Lender of any Defaulted Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender or by the non-pro rata application of any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the Revolving Loans in accordance with the terms of this subsection 2.9 or by a combination thereof) and (2) such Defaulting Lender shall have delivered to Company and Administrative Agent a written reaffirmation of its intention to honor its obligations under this Agreement with respect to its Revolving Loan Commitment, and (C) the date on which Company, Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders waive all Funding Defaults of such Defaulting Lender in writing, and (II) "DEFAULT EXCESS" means, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, the excess, if any, of such Defaulting Lender's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of all Lenders (calculated as if all Defaulting Lenders (other than such Defaulting Lender) had funded all of their respective Defaulted Revolving Loans) over the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans of such Defaulting Lender. No Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or otherwise affected, and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this subsection 2.9, performance by Company of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be excused or otherwise modified, as a result of any Funding Default or the operation of this subsection 2.9.

B. Company may, by giving written notice to Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election to do so: (i) elect to (a) terminate the Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, of such Terminated Lender upon receipt by such Terminated Lender of such notice and (b) prepay at par on the date of such termination any outstanding Loans made by such Terminated Lender, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts payable to such Terminated Lender hereunder pursuant to subsection 2.6, subsection 2.7 or subsection 3.6 or otherwise; PROVIDED that, in the event such Terminated Lender has any Loans outstanding at the time of such termination, the written consent of Administrative Agent and Requisite Lenders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required in order for Company to make the election set forth in this clause (i); or (ii) elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign its outstanding Loans and its Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees (each a "REPLACEMENT LENDER") in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.1B; PROVIDED that (a) on the date of such assignment, Company shall pay any amounts payable to such 62

C. Upon the prepayment of all amounts owing to any Terminated Lender and the termination of such Terminated Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment, if any, pursuant to clause (i) of subsection 2.10B, (i) SCHEDULE 2.1 shall be deemed modified to reflect any corresponding changes in the Revolving Loan Commitments and (ii) such Terminated Lender shall no longer constitute a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement; PROVIDED that any rights of such Terminated Lender to indemnification under this Agreement (including under subsections 2.6D, 2.7, 3.6, 10.2 and 10.3) shall survive as to such Terminated Lender.

(in the time zone of such office of the Issuing Lender) on such business day.

their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit. B. REIMBURSEMENT BY COMPANY OF AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT. In the event an Issuing Lender has determined to honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall immediately notify Company and Administrative Agent, and Company shall reimburse such Issuing Lender on or before the Business Day immediately following the date on which such drawing is honored (the "REIMBURSEMENT DATE") in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) and in same day funds equal to the amount of such honored drawing; PROVIDED that, anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) unless Company shall have notified Administrative Agent and such Issuing Lender prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date such drawing is honored that Company intends to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Loans, Company shall be deemed to have given a timely Notice of Borrowing to Administrative Agent requesting Revolving Lenders to make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans on the Reimbursement Date in an amount in Dollars (which amount, in the case of a drawing under a Letter of Credit which is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, shall be calculated by reference to the applicable Exchange Rate) equal to the amount of such honored drawing and (ii) subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in subsection 4.2B, Revolving Lenders shall, on the Reimbursement Date, make Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans in the amount of such honored drawing, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by Administrative Agent to reimburse such Issuing Lender for the amount of such honored drawing; and PROVIDED, FURTHER that if for any reason proceeds of Revolving Loans are not received by such Issuing Lender on the Reimbursement Date in an amount equal to the amount of such honored drawing, Company shall reimburse such Issuing Lender, on demand, in an amount in same day funds equal to the excess of the amount of such honored drawing over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, if any, which are so received. Nothing in this subsection 3.3B shall be deemed to relieve any Revolving Lender from its obligation to make Revolving Loans on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Revolving Lender resulting from the failure of such Revolving Lender to make such Revolving Loans under this subsection 3.3B. C. PAYMENT BY REVOLVING LENDERS OF UNREIMBURSED AMOUNTS PAID UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT. (i) PAYMENT BY REVOLVING LENDERS.

Share. Each Revolving Lender shall make available to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to its respective participation, in Dollars and in same day funds, at the office of such Issuing Lender specified in such notice, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the first business day (under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such office of such Issuing Lender is located) after the date notified by such Issuing Lender. In the event that any Revolving Lender fails to make available to such Issuing Lender on such business day the amount of such Revolving Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this subsection 3.3C, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for three Business Days and thereafter at the Base Rate. Nothing in this subsection 3.3C shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Revolving Lender to recover from any Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such Revolving Lender to such Issuing Lender pursuant to this subsection 3.3C in the event that it is determined by the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender in respect of which payment was made by such Lender constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender. (ii) DISTRIBUTION TO REVOLVING LENDERS OF REIMBURSEMENTS RECEIVED FROM COMPANY. In the event any Issuing Lender shall have been reimbursed by other Revolving Lenders pursuant to subsection 3.3C(i) for all or any portion of any drawing honored by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it, such Issuing Lender shall distribute to each other Revolving Lender which has paid all amounts payable by it under subsection 3.3C(i) with respect to such honored drawing such other Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments subsequently received by such Issuing Lender from Company in reimbursement of such honored drawing when such payments are received.

In addition to amounts payable as provided in subsection 3.6, Company hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless each Issuing Lender from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel) which such Issuing Lender may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of any Letter of Credit by such Issuing Lender, other than as a result of (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or (b) subject to the following clause (ii), the wrongful dishonor by such Issuing Lender of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit issued by it or (ii) the failure of such Issuing Lender to honor a drawing under any such Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "GOVERNMENTAL ACTS"). B. NATURE OF ISSUING LENDERS' DUTIES. As between Company and any Issuing Lender, Company assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which 71
may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Lender, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of such Issuing Lender's rights or powers hereunder. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth in the first paragraph of this subsection 3.5B, any action taken or omitted by any Issuing Lender under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subsection 3.5, Company shall retain any and all rights it may have against any Issuing Lender for any liability arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender. 3.6 INCREASED COSTS AND TAXES RELATING TO LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the provisions of subsection 2.7B (which shall be controlling with respect to the matters covered thereby), in the event that any Issuing Lender or Lender shall reasonably determine (which determination shall, absent clearly demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the introduction or adoption (after the Closing Date) of any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or that any change (after the Closing Date) therein or in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, or that any determination (after the Closing Date) by a court or governmental authority, or that compliance by any Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender with any guideline, request or directive issued or made (after the Closing Date) by any central bank or other governmental or quasi-governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), in any such case: (i) subjects such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its lending or letter of credit office) to any additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Issuing Lender or Lender) with respect to the issuing or maintaining of any Letters of Credit or the purchasing or maintaining of any participations therein or any other obligations under this Section 3, whether directly or by such being imposed on or suffered by any particular Issuing Lender; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or similar requirement in respect of any Letters of 72
Credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participations therein purchased by any Lender; or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or affecting such Issuing Lender or Lender (or its lending or letter of credit office) regarding this Section 3 or any Letter of Credit or any participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender of agreeing to issue, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or agreeing to purchase, purchasing or maintaining any participation therein or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender (or its lending or letter of credit office) with respect thereto; then, in any case, Company shall pay to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender, promptly after receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender shall deliver to Company (with a copy to Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to such Issuing Lender or Revolving Lender under this subsection 3.6, which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent clearly demonstrable error.

A. POWERS; DUTIES SPECIFIED. Each Lender irrevocably authorizes each Agent to take such action on such Lender's behalf and to exercise such powers, rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated or granted to such Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers, rights and remedies as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Agent shall have only those duties and responsibilities that are expressly specified in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Administrative Agent may exercise such powers, rights and remedies and perform such duties by or through its agents or employees. No Agent shall have, by reason of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon any Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein. B. NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN MATTERS. No Agent shall be responsible to any Lender for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any representations, warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written or oral statements or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports or certificates or any other documents furnished or made by such Agent to Lenders or by or on behalf of Company to such Agent or any Lender in connection with the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby or for the financial condition or business affairs of Company or any other Person liable for the payment of any Obligations, nor shall such Agent be required to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained in any of the Loan Documents or as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or the use of the Letters of Credit or as to the existence or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Administrative Agent shall not have any liability arising from confirmations of the amount of outstanding Loans or the Letter of Credit Usage or the component amounts thereof. C. EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. Neither Administrative Agent nor Collateral Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable to Lenders for any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the Loan Documents except to the extent caused by such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Agent shall be entitled to refrain from any act or the taking of any action (including the failure to take an action) in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until such Agent shall have received instructions in respect thereof from Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6) and, upon receipt of such instructions from Requisite 104
Lenders (or such other Lenders, as the case may be), such Agent shall be entitled to act or (where so instructed) refrain from acting, or to exercise such power, discretion or authority, in accordance with such instructions. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any communication, instrument or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons, and shall be entitled to rely and shall be protected in relying on opinions and judgments of attorneys (who may be attorneys for Company and its Subsidiaries), accountants, experts and other professional advisors selected by it; and (ii) no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against either Agent as a result of such Agent acting or (where so instructed) refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required to give such instructions under subsection 10.6). D. AGENTS ENTITLED TO ACT AS LENDERS. The agency hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, an Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender hereunder. With respect to its participation in the Loans and the Letters of Credit, an Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not performing the duties and functions delegated to it hereunder, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include such Agent in its individual capacity. An Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other business with Company or any of its Affiliates as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from Company for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. 9.3 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR APPRAISAL OF CREDITWORTHINESS. Each Lender represents and warrants that it has made its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making of the Loans and the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder and that it has made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of Company and its Subsidiaries. No Agent shall have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such investigation or any such appraisal on behalf of Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and no Agent shall have any responsibility with respect to the accuracy of or the completeness of any information provided to Lenders. 9.4 RIGHT TO INDEMNITY. Each Lender, in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, severally agrees to indemnify each Agent to the extent that such Person shall not have been reimbursed by Company, for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, 105
suits, costs, expenses (including counsel fees and disbursements) or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Person in exercising its powers, rights and remedies or performing its duties hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or otherwise in its capacity as Agent, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; PROVIDED that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified Person. If any indemnity furnished to an Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of such Person, be insufficient or become impaired, such Person may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. 9.5 SUCCESSOR AGENTS AND SWING LINE LENDER.

Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, Company, Collateral Agent and each Lender hereby agree that (X) no Lender shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral under any Collateral Document or to enforce the Guaranties, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Collateral Documents and the Guaranties may be exercised solely by Collateral Agent for the benefit of Lenders in accordance with the terms thereof, and (Y) in the event of a foreclosure by Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale, Collateral Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser of any or all of such Collateral at any such sale and Collateral Agent, as agent for and representative of Lenders (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities unless Requisite Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing) shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by Collateral Agent at such sale.

Each Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or participation therein, or other Obligation may (a) be assigned in any amount to an Eligible Assignee that is another Lender, an Affiliate or Related Fund (treating any Related Funds as a single Eligible Assignee) of a Lender, with the giving of notice to Company and Administrative Agent or (b) be assigned in an aggregate amount of not less than $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as shall constitute the aggregate amount of the Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit and participations therein, and other Obligations of the assigning Lender) to any other Eligible Assignee with the consent of (x) Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (y) so long as no Event of Default under subsection 8.6 or 8.7 shall have occurred and be continuing, Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) EXCEPT in connection with an assignment pursuant to clause (b) within 45 days after the Closing Date made as part of the primary syndication of the Loans and Commitments; PROVIDED that if any such Related Fund subsequently assigns all or any part of its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participation therein pursuant to clause (b), such assignment must be in an amount of at least $1,000,000 (either individually or when taken together with the amount assigned by all Related Funds), unless the aggregate amount of Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participation therein held by all such Related Funds is less than $1,000,000, in which case such aggregate amount may be assigned, with the consent of (x) Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (y) so long as no Event of Default under subsection 8.6 or 8.7 shall have occurred and be continuing, Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). To the extent of any such assignment in accordance with either clause (a) or (b) above, the assigning Lender shall be relieved 108
of its obligations with respect to its Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or participations therein, or other Obligations or the portion thereof so assigned. The parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment Agreement, together with a processing and recordation fee of (i) $3,500 for assignments to Eligible Assignees other than another Lender, an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender and (ii) $2,000 for assignments to another Lender, an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender and, in each case, such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsections 2.7B(iii)(a). Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recordation, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment Agreement, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, relinquish its rights (other than any rights which survive the termination of this Agreement under subsection 10.8B) and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto; PROVIDED that, anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if such Lender is the Issuing Lender with respect to any outstanding Letters of Credit such Lender shall continue to have all rights and obligations of an Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit until the cancellation or expiration of such Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder). The Commitments hereunder shall be modified to reflect the Commitment of such assignee and any remaining Commitment of such assigning Lender and, if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any Notes hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as practicable, surrender its applicable Notes, if any, to Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon new Notes shall, if so requested by the assignee and/or the assigning Lender in accordance with subsection 2.1E, be issued to the assignee and to the assigning Lender, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT IV, EXHIBIT V or EXHIBIT VI annexed hereto, as the case may be, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments and/or outstanding Tranche A Term Loans and/or Tranche B Term Loans, and/or Revolving Loans, as the case may be, of the assignee and the assigning Lender. (ii) ACCEPTANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; RECORDATION IN REGISTER. Upon its receipt of an Assignment Agreement executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible Assignee, together with the processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection 10.1B(i) and any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal income tax withholding matters that such assignee may be required to deliver to Administrative Agent pursuant to subsections 2.7B(iii)(a), Administrative Agent shall, if Administrative Agent and Company have consented to the assignment evidenced thereby (in each case to the 109
extent such consent is required pursuant to subsection 10.1B(i)), (a) accept such Assignment Agreement by executing a counterpart thereof as provided therein (which acceptance shall evidence any required consent of Administrative Agent to such assignment), (b) record the information contained therein in the Register, and (c) give prompt notice thereof to Company. Administrative Agent shall maintain a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to and accepted by it as provided in this subsection 10.1B(ii). C. PARTICIPATIONS. The holder of any participation, other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except action directly affecting (i) the extension of the scheduled final maturity date of any Loan allocated to such participation or (ii) a reduction of the principal amount of or the rate of interest payable on any Loan allocated to such participation or a reduction of the fee payable in respect of any Letter of Credit allocated to such participation or a reduction of any commitment fee in respect of any Commitment allocated to such participation, and all amounts payable by Company hereunder (including amounts payable to such Lender pursuant to subsections 2.6D, 2.7 and 3.6) shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation. Company and each Lender hereby acknowledge and agree that, solely for purposes of subsections 10.4 and 10.5, (a) any participation will give rise to a direct obligation of Company to the participant and (b) the participant shall be considered to be a "Lender". D. ASSIGNMENTS TO FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS AND FUND TRUSTEES. In addition to the assignments and participations permitted under the foregoing provisions of this subsection 10.1, any Lender may assign and pledge all or any portion of its Loans, the other Obligations owed to such Lender, and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank and any Lender which is an investment fund may pledge or assign all or any portion of its Notes, Loans or other Obligations owed to such Lender to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee; PROVIDED that (i) no Lender shall, as between Company and such Lender, be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment and pledge and (ii) in no event shall such Federal Reserve Bank be considered to be a "Lender" or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder. E. INFORMATION. Each Lender may furnish any information concerning Company and its Subsidiaries in the possession of that Lender from time to time to assignees and participants (including prospective assignees and participants), subject to subsection 10.18. F. REPRESENTATIONS OF LENDERS. Each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof hereby represents and warrants (i) that it is an Eligible Assignee described in clause (A) of the definition thereof; (ii) that it has experience and expertise in the making of loans such as the Loans; and (iii) that it will make and/or purchase its Loans for its own account in the ordinary course of its business and without a view to distribution of such Loans within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this subsection 10.1, the 110
disposition of such Loans or any interests therein shall at all times remain within its exclusive control). Each Lender that becomes a party hereto pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to agree that the representations and warranties of such Lender contained in paragraph 1.2 of such Assignment Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference. 10.2 EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, Company agrees to pay promptly (i) all the actual and reasonable costs and expenses of preparation of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto; (ii) all the costs of furnishing all opinions by counsel for Company (including any opinions requested by Lenders as to any legal matters arising hereunder) and of Company's performance of and compliance with all agreements and conditions on its part to be performed or complied with under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including with respect to confirming compliance with environmental, insurance and solvency requirements; (iii) the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to Administrative Agent (including allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and administration of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and any other documents or matters requested by Company; (iv) all the actual costs and reasonable expenses of creating and perfecting Liens in favor of Collateral Agent on behalf of Lenders pursuant to any Collateral Document, including filing fees, expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, search fees and reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel to Collateral Agent; (v) all the actual costs and reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any environmental consultants retained by Administrative Agent or its counsel) of obtaining and reviewing any environmental audits or reports provided for on or before the Closing Date; (vi) all the actual costs and reasonable expenses of the custody or preservation of any of the Collateral; (vii) all other actual and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Syndication Agent and Administrative Agent in connection with the syndication of the Commitments and the negotiation, preparation and execution of the Loan Documents and any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications thereto and the transactions contemplated thereby; and (viii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of settlement, incurred by Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and each Lender in enforcing any Obligations of or in collecting any payments due from any Loan Party hereunder or under the other Loan Documents by reason of such Event of Default (including in connection with the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guaranties) or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. 10.3 INDEMNITY. In addition to the payment of expenses pursuant to subsection 10.2, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated, Company agrees to defend (subject to Indemnitees' selection of counsel), indemnify, pay and hold harmless each Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, and each Lender (including Issuing Lender), and the officers, 111
directors, employees, trustees, advisors, partners, agents and affiliates of each Agent, each Joint Lead Arranger, and each Lender (collectively called the "INDEMNITEES"), from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities (as hereinafter defined); PROVIDED that Company shall not have any obligation to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnitee as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. As used herein, "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES" means, collectively, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for Indemnitees in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened by any Person, whether or not any such Indemnitee shall be designated as a party or a potential party thereto, and any fees or expenses incurred by Indemnitees in enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal, state or foreign laws, statutes, rules or regulations (including securities and commercial laws, statutes, rules or regulations and Environmental Laws), on common law or equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Indemnitee, in any manner relating to or arising out of (i) this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including Lenders' agreement to make the Loans hereunder or the use or intended use of the proceeds thereof or the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder or the use or intended use of any thereof, or any enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon any of the Collateral or the enforcement of the Guaranties), (ii) the statements contained in the commitment letter delivered by any Lender to Company with respect thereto, or (iii) any Environmental Claim or any Hazardous Materials relating to or arising from, directly or indirectly, any past or present activity, operation, land ownership, or practice of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold harmless set forth in this subsection 10.3 may be unenforceable in whole or in part because they are violative of any law or public policy, Company shall contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Indemnitees or any of them. 10.4 SET-OFF. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default each Lender is hereby authorized by Company at any time or from time to time, without notice to Company or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender to or for the credit or the account of Company against and on account of any obligations and liabilities of Company then due and payable to that Lender under this Agreement, the Letters 112
of Credit and participations therein and the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not that Lender shall have made any demand for payment thereof. 10.5 RATABLE SHARING. Lenders hereby agree among themselves that if any of them shall, whether by voluntary payment (other than a voluntary prepayment of Loans made and applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), by realization upon security, through the exercise of any right of set-off or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any right under the Loan Documents or otherwise, or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, receive payment or reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of principal, interest, amounts payable in respect of Letters of Credit, fees and other amounts then due and owing to that Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (collectively, the "AGGREGATE AMOUNTS DUE" to such Lender) which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (i) notify Administrative Agent and each other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (ii) apply a portion of such payment to purchase participations (which it shall be deemed to have purchased from each seller of a participation simultaneously upon the receipt by such seller of its portion of such payment) in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such recoveries of Aggregate Amounts Due shall be shared by all Lenders in proportion to the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; PROVIDED that if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of Company or otherwise, those purchases shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Company expressly consents to the foregoing arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by Company to that holder with respect thereto as fully as if that holder were owed the amount of the participation held by that holder. 10.6 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. A. No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, or consent to any departure by Company therefrom, shall in any event be effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders; PROVIDED that no such amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent shall, without the consent of each Lender (with Obligations directly affected in the case of the following clause (i)): (i) extend the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or Note, or extend the stated expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Loan Commitment Termination Date, or reduce the rate of interest on any Loan (other than any waiver of any increase in the interest rate applicable to any Loan pursuant to subsection 2.2E) or any commitment fees or letter of credit fees payable hereunder, or extend the time for payment of any such interest or fees, or reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or any reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit, (ii) amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of this subsection 10.6, (iii) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of "Requisite Lenders" 113
(it being understood that additional extensions of credit approved by Requisite Lenders pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of "Requisite Lenders" without any further approval by Lenders being required), (iv) consent to the assignment or transfer by Company of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or (v) release all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from the Subsidiary Guaranty except as expressly provided in the Loan Documents; PROVIDED, FURTHER that no such amendment, modification, termination or waiver shall (1) increase the Commitments of any Lender over the amount thereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver of any condition precedent, covenant, Potential Event of Default or Event of Default shall constitute an increase in the Commitment of any Lender, and that no increase in the available portion of any Commitment of any Lender shall constitute an increase in such Commitment of such Lender); (2) amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of subsection 2.1A(iv) or any other provision of this Agreement relating to the Swing Line Loan Commitment or the Swing Line Loans without the consent of Swing Line Lender; (3) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of "Requisite Class Lenders" without the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of each Class (it being understood that additional extensions of credit approved by Requisite Lenders pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of "Requisite Class Lenders" without any further approval by Lenders being required), or alter the required application of any repayments or prepayments as between Classes pursuant to subsection 2.4B(iv) without the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of each Class which is being allocated a lesser repayment or prepayment as a result thereof (although Requisite Lenders may waive, in whole or in part, any mandatory prepayment so long as the application, as between Classes, of any portion of such prepayment which is still required to be made is not altered); (4) without the consent of Requisite Class Lenders of the respective Class, waive, reduce or postpone any scheduled repayment set forth in subsection 2.4A with respect to the applicable Term Loans of such affected Class; (5) amend, modify, terminate or waive any obligation of Revolving Lenders relating to the purchase of participations in Letters of Credit as provided in subsection 3.1C without the written concurrence of Administrative Agent and of each Issuing Lender which has a Letter of Credit then outstanding or which has not been reimbursed for a drawing under a Letter of Credit issued it; or (6) amend, modify, terminate or waive any provision of Section 9 as the same applies to Administrative Agent, or any other provision of this Agreement as the same applies to the rights or obligations of Administrative Agent, in each case without the consent of Administrative Agent. B. Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, with the concurrence of any Lender, execute amendments, modifications, waivers or consents on behalf of that Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. No notice to or demand on Company in any case shall entitle Company to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance with this subsection 10.6 shall be binding upon each Lender at the time outstanding, each future Lender and, if signed by Company, on Company. 114
10.7 NOTICES. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served, telexed or sent by telefacsimile or United States mail or courier service and shall be deemed to have been given when delivered in person or by courier service, upon receipt of telefacsimile or telex, or three Business Days after depositing it in the United States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed; PROVIDED that notices to any Agent shall not be effective until received.

A. All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit hereunder. B. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or implied by law to the contrary, the agreements of Company set forth in subsections 2.6D, 2.7, 3.5A, 3.6, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and the agreements of Lenders set forth in subsections 9.2C, 9.4 and 10.5 shall survive the payment of the Loans, the cancellation or expiration of the Letters of Credit and the reimbursement of any amounts drawn thereunder, and the termination of this Agreement. 10.9 FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the part of any Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 10.10 MARSHALLING; PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. Neither Administrative Agent, nor Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Company or any other party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that Company makes a payment or payments to either Agent or Lenders (or to either Agent for the benefit of Lenders), or either Agent or Lenders enforce any security interests or exercise their rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights 115
and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred. 10.11 SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement or the Notes shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 10.12 OBLIGATIONS SEVERAL; INDEPENDENT NATURE OF LENDERS' RIGHTS. The obligations of Lenders hereunder are several and no Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitments of any other Lender hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and no action taken by Lenders pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute Lenders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and it shall not be necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. 10.13 HEADINGS. Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect. 10.14 APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK), WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. 10.15 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of Lenders (it being understood that Lenders' rights of assignment are subject to subsection 10.1). None of Company's rights or obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents nor any interest therein may be assigned or delegated by Company without the prior written consent of all Lenders. 116
10.16 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST COMPANY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER, MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE STATE, COUNTY AND CITY OF NEW YORK. BY EXECUTING AND DELIVERING THIS AGREEMENT, COMPANY, FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, IRREVOCABLY (I) ACCEPTS GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS; (II) WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS; (III) AGREES THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO COMPANY AT ITS ADDRESS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION 10.7; (IV) AGREES THAT SERVICE AS PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (III) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER COMPANY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT; (V) AGREES THAT LENDERS RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST COMPANY IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION; AND (VI) AGREES THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION 10.16 RELATING TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE SHALL BE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW SECTION 5-1402 OR OTHERWISE. 10.17 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY DEALINGS AMONG THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LOAN TRANSACTION OR THE LENDER/BORROWER RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all-encompassing of any and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject matter of this transaction, including contract 117
claims, tort claims, breach of duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. Each party hereto acknowledges that this waiver is a material inducement to enter into a business relationship, that each has already relied on this waiver in entering into this Agreement, and that each will continue to rely on this waiver in their related future dealings. Each party hereto further warrants and represents that it has reviewed this waiver with its legal counsel and that it knowingly and voluntarily waives its jury trial rights following consultation with legal counsel. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING (OTHER THAN BY A MUTUAL WRITTEN WAIVER SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THIS SUBSECTION 10.17 AND EXECUTED BY EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO), AND THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE LOANS MADE HEREUNDER. In the event of litigation, this Agreement may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court. 10.18 CONFIDENTIALITY. Each Lender shall hold all non-public information obtained pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement which has been identified as confidential by Company in accordance with such Lender's customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, it being understood and agreed by Company that in any event a Lender may make disclosures to Affiliates, Related Funds and investment advisors or managers of such Lender or disclosures reasonably required by any bona fide assignee, transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated assignment or transfer by such Lender of any Loans or any participations therein or disclosures required or requested by any governmental agency or representative thereof, or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") or any other Person with the prior written consent of Company and Administrative Agent in the exercise of their respective sole discretion or pursuant to legal process; PROVIDED that, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, each Lender shall use its best efforts to notify Company of any request by any governmental agency or representative thereof or the NAIC (other than any such request in connection with any examination of the financial condition of such Lender by such governmental agency or the NAIC) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information; and PROVIDED, FURTHER that in no event shall any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each party hereto authorizes the other to disclose all information and materials regarding the tax structure and tax aspects of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents to the extent required by Internal Revenue Code Section 6011 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder in order to avoid the transaction contemplated therein being treated as a "Confidential Transaction" as defined by such Treasury Regulations. 10.19 COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto or in connection herewith may be executed in any number of counterparts and by 118
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument; signature pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same document.
