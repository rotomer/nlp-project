Exhibit 99.1
        Wallingford, Connecticut. July 16, 2003. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs increased 30% to $.60 compared to $.46 per share for the 2002 period. Such per share amount for 2003 excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of the Company's debt completed in the second quarter. Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2003 was $.45. Sales for the second quarter 2003 increased 13% to $304,893,000 compared to $270,865,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $17.9 million in the second quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
        For the six months ended June 30, 2003, diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs was $1.14 compared to $.86 per share for the 2002 period. Such per share amount for the six month 2003 period excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt referred to above. Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $.98. Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2003 were $582,667,000 compared to $526,841,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $34.7 million for the six month 2003 period when compared to the 2002 period.
        As previously announced, in the second quarter 2003 the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities and redeemed all of its outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes"). In conjunction therewith, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt totaling $10,367,000 (before tax benefit of $3,525,000) or $.16 per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the call premium on the Notes, write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and other related costs.
        Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results. Sales were up 13% compared to last year's second quarter. The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 17% over last year, and the growth was broad based across substantially all of our major military/aerospace, industrial/automotive and communications end markets and all major geographic regions. The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets. The coaxial cable for broadband cable television networks portion of our business, which represents 12% of our sales, was up sequentially from the first quarter this year but down from the second quarter last year as both domestic and international cable operators have curtailed their capital
spending for network upgrades and expansion. In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Earnings per share for the quarter, excluding one-time refinancing expenses, represent the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. Our operating income margin continued strong at 16.2% for the quarter, and cash flow from operations was $26.8 million. The debt refinancing completed in the quarter gives us significantly increased flexibility to pursue additional opportunities to grow and expand our business. In addition, the acquisition of the Insilco cable assembly business completed in the first quarter and the acquisition of the PCD industrial/avionics business completed in the second quarter made a positive contribution to operations."
        "Notwithstanding the excellent second quarter and first half results, the overall economic climate remains challenging and the timing and strength of a general economic recovery remains uncertain; and accordingly it continues to be difficult forecasting future results. However, we are encouraged with our leading positions in excellent and diversified markets and by our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets. In addition, the excellent first half results and the fine execution on our operating plans gives us the confidence that we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2003 revenue growth from 4-7% to 9-12% and our expectation for full year 2003 EPS increase from 20-25% to 25-30% (excluding the one-time debt refinancing costs)."
