Wallingford, Connecticut. October 15, 2003. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $.64 compared to $.48 per share for the 2002 period.  Sales for the third quarter 2003 increased 17% to $314,798,000 compared to $268,115,000 for the 2002 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $11.7 million in the third quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs was $1.78 compared to $1.33 per share for the 2002 period.  Such per share amount for the nine month 2003 period excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of the Company's debt in the second quarter 2003.  Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $1.62.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $897,465,000 compared to $794,956,000 for the 2002 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales
by approximately $46.3 million for the nine month 2003 period when compared to the 2002 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our third quarter results.  Sales were up 17% compared to last year's third quarter.  The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 18% over last year, and the growth was broad based across all of our end markets comprising mobile communications, computer/data communications, industrial, automotive and military/aerospace markets and the sales increase included all major geographic regions.  The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets.  The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was up 12% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter, was up 33% over last year and represents the seventh consecutive quarterly increase.  The diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $.64 includes a charge of approximately $750,000, or $.01 per share, for the cost of the secondary offering completed in the third quarter this year.   Our operating income margin was a strong 16.6%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Cash flow from operations was also excellent at $34.9 million for the quarter.  During the year, we have substantially reinvested the strong cash flow in the business and also reduced our outstanding debt by $73.0 million."
"On the basis of the strong third quarter results, we are again revising upward our expectation for full year 2003 revenue growth from 9-12% to 13-15% and our full year 2003 EPS increase (excluding the one-time second quarter debt refinancing costs) from 25-30% to 31-33%, or an EPS expectation for the fourth quarter 2003 of $.64-$.68.  We caution that business conditions remain challenging and it continues to be difficult forecasting future results; however, we are encouraged by our strong position in excellent and diversified markets, our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets and some signs of general economic improvement."
