Exhibit 99.1
        Wallingford, Connecticut. January 21, 2004. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2003 diluted earnings per share increased 42% to $.74 compared to $.52 per share for the 2002 period. Sales for the fourth quarter 2003 increased 28% to $342,039,000 compared to $267,046,000 for the 2002 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $17.6 million in the fourth quarter 2003 compared to the 2002 period.
        For the year ended December 31, 2003, diluted earnings per share before refinancing costs was $2.52 compared to $1.85 per share for 2002. Such per share amount for the year 2003 excludes the one-time effect of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of the Company's debt in the second quarter 2003. Including such one-time expenses, diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $2.36. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $1,239,504,000 compared to $1,062,002,000 for 2002. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $63.9 million for the year 2003 when compared to 2002.
        The Company also announced that it will effect a 2 for 1 stock split for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The Company expects the additional shares will be distributed on or about March 29, 2004.
        Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated: "I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results. Sales were up 28% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 28% over last year with excellent profitability. The growth was broad based across all of our end markets comprising mobile communications, computer/data communications, industrial, automotive and military/aerospace markets and the sales increase included all major geographic regions. The excellent results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers as well as increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets. In the fourth quarter, we also acquired a relatively small U.S. manufacturer of antennas for wireless network infrastructure. The acquisition complements and broadens our product offering to this global market. The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was also up a strong 29% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year; however, operating margins in this market continue to be adversely impacted by increasing material costs."
        "In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Earnings per share for the quarter was up 42% over last year and represents the eighth consecutive quarterly increase. Earnings per share for the year of $2.52 per share, excluding the one-time
refinancing expenses, matches our all-time record year of 2000. Our consolidated operating income margin for the quarter was strong at 16.8%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was also excellent at $54.1 million for the quarter and $159.4 million for the year. During the year, we have reinvested the strong cash flow in the business and also reduced our outstanding debt by $101.3 million."
        "I am also very pleased to announce that the following members of our operating management team have been appointed Corporate officers: Gary Anderson, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Aerospace and Industrial Operations; Jamie Fraser, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Interconnect Systems; Mark Twaalfhoven, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, Commercial Connectors; Luc Walter, Senior Vice President and Group General Manager, European Military and Aerospace Operations; Udo Naujoks, Vice President and Group General Manager, Amphenol Tuchel Electronics; and Adam Norwitt, Vice President and Group General Manager, RF and Microwave Products."
        "We had an excellent year in 2003 and look to the future with great enthusiasm based on our excellent product portfolio and technological capabilities, our strong position in excellent and diversified markets, our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets and an outstanding management team. Our enthusiasm and confidence in the future is also reflected in our decision to effect a 2 for 1 stock split in the first quarter 2004, which should further improve the liquidity and trading in our stock. We are also encouraged by the increasing signs of a general economic recovery. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, I believe that in 2004 we can achieve an increase in revenues in the range of 8%-11% and an increase in EPS in the range of 16%-21% (excluding the 2003 one-time refinancing expenses)."
