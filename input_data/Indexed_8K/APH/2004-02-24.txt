(b)
Each of the Selling Stockholders agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Selling Stockholder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus.

provided, however
, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter who failed to deliver a Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, (so long as the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto was provided by the Company to the several Underwriters in the requisite quantity and on a timely basis to permit proper delivery on or prior to the Closing Date or the Option Closing Date, as the case may be) to the person asserting any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such material misstatement or omission or alleged material misstatement or omission was cured in the Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, and such Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person.

"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
indemnifying party
") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and 8(c), or pursuant to both Sections 8(b) and 8(c), the Underwriter shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(d), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of such Underwriter). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters, their officers and directors and all persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and all persons, if any, who control the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Selling Stockholders and all persons, if any, who control any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either such Section, and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters, their officers and directors and such control persons of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by each of the Representatives. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholders and such control persons of any Selling Stockholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Attorneys. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with its written consent or (ii) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than
twenty business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have (a) failed to comply with such reimbursement request or (b) contested, in good faith, such fees and expenses of counsel. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
(e)
To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action, that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of its Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Selling Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares purchased by each of the Underwriters hereunder and not joint. The Selling Stockholders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares sold by each Selling Stockholder hereunder and not joint.
(f)
Each Selling Stockholder that is not a KKR Selling Stockholder hereby designates CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, as its authorized agent, upon which process may be served in any action which may be instituted in any state or federal court in the State of New York by any Underwriter, any director or officer of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter asserting a claim for indemnification or contribution under or pursuant to this Section 8, and each such Selling Stockholder will accept the jurisdiction of such court in such action, and waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any defense based upon lack of personal jurisdiction or venue. A copy of any such process shall be sent or given to such Selling Stockholder, at the address for notices specified in Section 12 hereof.
