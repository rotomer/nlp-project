Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 21, 2004.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 48% to a record $.40 compared to $.27 per share for the comparable 2003 period.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.)  Sales for the first quarter 2004 increased 28% to $355,261,000 compared to $277,774,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.2 million in the first quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results.  Sales were up 28% compared to last year's first quarter and the operating income margin increased from 16.3% to 17.3%.  The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 89% of our sales, was up a strong 28% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across most of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in infrastructure and mobile handset components for wireless communication markets.  The excellent top
 
line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally strengthening economy.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 11% of our sales, was up a strong 27% over a comparatively weak quarter in the prior year; however, the operating income margin in this market was impacted by increasing material costs."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 48% over last year and represents the ninth consecutive quarterly increase.  Earnings per share of $.40 for the quarter is the highest ever, a significant accomplishment considering our long history of excellent profitability.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 17.3%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also significant at $31.8 million for the quarter."
 
"With the first quarter results, 2004 is off to a great start.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well, and we have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Furthermore, while uncertainties remain, there are signs of a general
economic recovery, albeit some geographic regions are more robust than others.  Accordingly, assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2004 results to a sales increase in the range of 12% to 15% and earnings per share increase in the range of 25% to 30%; this compares to our prior estimates of sales and earnings per share increases of 8% to 11% and 16% to 21%, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."
