REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 21, 2004.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 50% to a record $.45 compared to $.30 per share for the comparable 2003 period (excluding the effect in 2003 of a one-time charge relating to the early extinguishment of debt).  In the second quarter 2003, the Company refinanced its long term debt and incurred a one-time charge for write off of deferred debt issuance costs, early repayment premium and other related costs; diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2003 including such one-time charge was $.22.  All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.  Sales for the second quarter 2004 increased 27% to a record $387,119,000 compared to $304,893,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $8.5 million in the second quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, diluted earnings per share was $.85 compared to $.57 per share for the 2003 period (excluding the one-time charge in the 2003 period referred to above).  Diluted earnings per share for the six month 2003 period including
 
the one-time refinancing charge referred to above was $.49.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 were $742,380,000 compared to $582,667,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $24.7 million for the six month 2004 period when compared to the 2003 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our second quarter results.  Sales were up 27% compared to last year's second quarter and the operating income margin increased from 16.2% to 17.8%.  The interconnect portion of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 27% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in infrastructure and mobile handset components for wireless communication markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally stronger economy.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The coaxial cable portion of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was also up a strong 28% over the prior year; however, the operating income margin in this market continued to be impacted by higher material costs which were only partially offset by a price increase implemented in the latter part of the quarter."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 50% over last year and represents the tenth consecutive quarterly increase.  Sales of $387.1 million and earnings per share of $.45 for the quarter were the highest ever, a significant accomplishment considering our long history of excellent growth and profitability.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 17.8%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is after interest expense and taxes, again exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also very strong at $53.9 million for the quarter and $85.7 million for the six months 2004."
 
"It was a very good quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well, and we have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Accordingly, assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are again revising upward our expectation for full year 2004 results to a sales increase in the range of 19% to 22% and earnings per share increase in the range of 35% to 40%; this compares to our prior estimate of sales and earnings per share increases of 12% to 15% and 25% to 30%, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."
