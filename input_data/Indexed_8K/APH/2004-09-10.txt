        (dd) The Company has filed all foreign, federal, state and local tax returns that are required to be filed or has requested extensions thereof (except in any case in which the failure so to file would not have a Material Adverse Effect) and has paid all taxes required to be paid by it and any other assessment, fine or penalty levied against it, to the extent that any of the foregoing is due and payable, except for any such assessment, fine or penalty that is currently being contested in good faith or as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        (ee) No labor problem or dispute with the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries exists or, to the Company's knowledge, is threatened, and the Company is not aware of any existing labor dispute by the employees of any of its or its Subsidiaries' principal suppliers, contractors or customers, that could have a Material Adverse Effect.
        (ff)  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are prudent and customary in the businesses in which they are engaged.
        (gg) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined as Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in accordance with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company has carried out evaluations, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act.

")), the Underwriter who purchased such Shares delivered on the Closing Date to The Depository Trust Company or other securities intermediary by making payment therefor as provided herein, and who had such Shares credited to the securities account or accounts of the Underwriter maintained with The Depository Trust Company or such other securities intermediary will have acquired a security entitlement (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(17) of the UCC) to such Shares purchased by the Underwriter, and no action based on an adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8-105 of the UCC) may be asserted against the Underwriter with respect to the Shares.

        (j)    At any time during the period described in Section 5(f), if there is any change in the information referred to in Section 7(i), such Selling Stockholder will immediately notify the Underwriter of such change.

    Indemnification.
    
        (a)   The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action, that could give rise to any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the Underwriter furnished in writing to the Company by the Underwriter expressly for use therein;
provided, however
, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter who failed to deliver a Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, (so long as the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto was provided by the Company to the Underwriter in the requisite quantity and on a timely basis to permit proper delivery on or prior to the Closing Date) to the person asserting any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such material misstatement or omission or alleged material misstatement or omission was cured in the Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, and such Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person.
        (b)   Each of the Selling Stockholders agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Selling Stockholder furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Stockholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any preliminary prospectus. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of any Selling Stockholder pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be limited to an amount equal to the total proceeds (before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses) received by such Selling Stockholder from the Underwriter for the sale of the Shares sold by such Selling Stockholder hereunder;
provided, however
, that the
foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any preliminary prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter who failed to deliver a Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, (so long as the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto was provided by the Company to the Underwriter in the requisite quantity and on a timely basis to permit proper delivery on or prior to the Closing Date) to the person asserting any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such preliminary prospectus, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such material misstatement or omission or alleged material misstatement or omission was cured in the Prospectus, as so amended or supplemented, and such Prospectus was required by law to be delivered at or prior to the written confirmation of sale to such person.
        (c)   The Underwriter agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each Selling Stockholder and each person, if any, who controls such Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to the Underwriter furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriter expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
        (d)   In case any action shall be commenced involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a), 8(b) or 8(c) (the "
indemnified party
"), the indemnified party shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "
indemnifying party
") in writing and the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of all fees and expenses of such counsel, as incurred (except that in the case of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to both Sections 8(a) and 8(c), or pursuant to both Sections 8(b) and 8(c), the Underwriter shall not be required to assume the defense of such action pursuant to this Section 8(d), but may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel, except as provided below, shall be at the expense of the Underwriter). Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnified party unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such action or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party or (iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party shall have been advised by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party). In any such case, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriter, its officers and directors and all persons, if any, who control the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and all persons, if any, who control the Company within the meaning of either such Section and (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for all Selling Stockholders and all persons, if any, who control any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either such Section, and all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the
Underwriter, its officers and directors and such control persons of the Underwriter, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriter. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholders and such control persons of any Selling Stockholders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Selling Stockholders. The indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments by reason of any settlement of any action (i) effected with its written consent or (ii) effected without its written consent if the settlement is entered into more than twenty business days after the indemnifying party shall have received a request from the indemnified party for reimbursement for the fees and expenses of counsel (in any case where such fees and expenses are at the expense of the indemnifying party) and, prior to the date of such settlement, the indemnifying party shall have (a) failed to comply with such reimbursement request or (b) contested, in good faith, such fees and expenses of counsel. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity or contribution may be or could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are or could have been the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.
        (e)   To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses but after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions) received by the Company or the Selling Stockholders, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, bear to the total price to the public of the Shares, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders on the one hand or the Underwriter on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
        The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(e) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed
to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any matter, including any action, that could have given rise to such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission and (ii) no Selling Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the proceeds received by such Selling Stockholder from the sale of its Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Selling Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Stockholders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(e) are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares sold by each Selling Stockholder hereunder and not joint.
        (f)    [reserved].
        SECTION 9.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        We have acted as counsel to Amphenol Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the Selling Stockholders (as defined below) in connection with the purchase by you of an aggregate of 6,656,814 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Shares"), of the Company from certain selling stockholders of the Company (the "Selling Stockholders") named in Schedule II to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement among you, the Company and the Selling Stockholders dated September 9, 2004 (the "Underwriting Agreement").
        We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-111687) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's prospectus, dated February 12, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated September 9, 2004 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004, Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on February 24, 2004, September 9, 2004 and September 10, 2004 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); and the Underwriting Agreement; relating to the Shares to be sold to the Underwriter, as named in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriter"), by such Selling Stockholders. We also have examined a specimen certificate representing the Class A Common Stock of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and of the Selling Stockholders and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.
        In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In addition, in connection with our opinion set forth in paragraph 4 below, we have assumed that (i) The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") is a "securities intermediary" as defined in Section 8-102 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York (the "New York UCC"), and the State of New York is the "securities intermediary's jurisdiction" of DTC for purposes of Section 8-110 of the New York UCC, (ii) the Shares are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, and DTC or another person on behalf of DTC maintains possession of certificates representing the Shares, (iii) DTC indicates by book entries on its books that security entitlements with respect to the Shares have been credited to the
Underwriter's securities accounts and (iv) the Underwriter is purchasing the Shares without notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of the New York UCC).
        Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
        1.     The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the law of the State of Delaware and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus.
        2.     All of the Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
        3.     Each Selling Stockholder that is a Delaware limited partnership has full partnership power, right and authority to sell such Shares.
        4.     Upon the payment and transfer contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter will acquire a security entitlement with respect to the Shares and no action based on an adverse claim may be asserted against the Underwriter.
        5.     The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Company's Class A Common Stock (including the Shares), constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such Class A Common Stock in all material respects.
        6.     The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and by or on behalf of each Selling Stockholder that is a Delaware limited partnership.
        7.     The compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will not breach or result in a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and which the Company has represented lists all material agreements and instruments to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such action violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law by any court or governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties.
        8.     No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court or any Delaware court acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law is required for the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, except for the registration under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act of the Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriter.
        9.     The sale of the Shares by KKR 1996 Fund L.P., NXS Associates L.P. and KKR Partners II L.P., each of which is a Delaware limited partnership (the "KKR Limited Partnerships"), and the compliance by the KKR Limited Partnerships with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement will not breach or result in a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument identified on the annexed schedule furnished to us by the KKR Limited Partnerships and which each KKR Limited Partnership has represented lists all material agreements
and instruments to which such KKR Limited Partnership is a party or by which such KKR Limited Partnership is bound or to which any of the property or assets of such KKR Limited Partnership is subject, nor will such action violate the Partnership Agreement of any KKR Limited Partnership or any federal or New York statute or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act by any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over any KKR Limited Partnership or any of its properties.

        11.   The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, the Prospectus was filed on September 10, 2004 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
        12.   There are no preemptive rights under federal or New York law or under the Delaware General Corporation Law to subscribe for or purchase shares of Company capital stock. There are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or purchase, nor any restriction upon the voting or transfer of, any shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the Company's charter or by-laws or any agreement or other instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and which the Company represented lists all material agreements and instruments to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party.
        13.   The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of and subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
        We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.

We did not participate in the preparation of the Exchange Act Documents; however, we reviewed the Company's 2003 Annual Report and the 2004 Quarterly Reports prior to their filing with the Commission.

all material respects, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case we express no view with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and
(ii)
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement (including the Company's 2003 Annual Report) as of the date of the filing of the Company's 2003 Annual Report, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus (including the Exchange Act Documents), as of September 9, 2004 or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case we express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
        I am General Counsel of Amphenol Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and have advised the Company in connection with the sale by the Selling Stockholders of 6,656,814 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated September 9, 2004 between the Company, the Selling Stockholders and you (the "Underwriting Agreement").
        This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 9(g) of the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Underwriting Agreement.
        I have reviewed signed copies of the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-111687) relating to the shares (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Company's prospectus dated February 12, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated September 9, 2004 (together, the "Prospectus"), in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. I have reviewed such documents and satisfied myself as to such other matters as I have deemed necessary in order to enable me to express this opinion. In my review, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, I have reviewed and relied upon, to the extent I have deemed such reliance proper, corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company.
        I am a member of the Bar of the State of Connecticut and do not express any opinion herein concerning the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Connecticut, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal laws of the United States.
        Subject to the foregoing and to the further exceptions and qualifications set forth herein, I am of the opinion that:
        1.     The Company has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as described in the Registration Statement and to own, lease and operate its properties.
        2.     The Company is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        3.     All outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, including the Shares, have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
        4.     Each Subsidiary has been duly incorporated, is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as described in the Registration Statement and to own, lease and operate its properties and, to my knowledge, is duly qualified and is in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of property requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        5.     All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company's Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and, except with respect to the shares of capital stock of the Subsidiaries listed on Schedule I hereto, are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, free and clear of any security interest, claim, lien, encumbrance or adverse interest of any nature, except as described in the Prospectus.
        6.     The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement by the Company, compliance by the Company with all the provisions thereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not conflict with, constitute a default under or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the certificate of incorporation or the by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any document, agreement, indenture or other instrument known to me to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties are bound or (iii) to my knowledge, any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), where such conflict, default or violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
        7.     To my knowledge, except as otherwise disclosed in the Prospectus, there is no legal or governmental proceeding pending to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their respective properties is the subject which is required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, and to my knowledge, no such proceeding is threatened.
        8.     To my knowledge, no contract or other document of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein is not so described or filed as required.
        In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, I have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of and counsel to the Company, representatives of the independent certified public accountants of the Company and representatives of the Underwriter and counsel to the Underwriter at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Although I have not undertaken to investigate or verify independently, and do not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to my attention that give me reason to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of the date of the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, as of September 9, 2004 or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that, in each case, I express no
opinion as to financial statements and related notes, the financial statement schedules and other financial and statistical data included or incorporated by reference therein.
        This opinion letter is rendered solely for your use in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and may not be relied upon in any manner by any other person or for any other purpose without my prior written consent.
