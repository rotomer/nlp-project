Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 19, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share increased 38% to a record $.51 compared to $.37 per share for the comparable 2003 period.  Per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2004.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2004 increased 18% to $403,963,000 compared to $342,039,000 for the 2003 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $11.5 million in the fourth quarter 2004 compared to the 2003 period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2004, diluted earnings per share was $1.82 compared to $1.26 per share for the 2003 period (excluding the effect in 2003 of a one-time charge relating to the early extinguishment of debt).  In the second quarter 2003, the Company refinanced its long term debt and incurred a one-time charge for write off of deferred debt issuance costs, early repayment premium and other related costs; diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2003 including such one-time charge was
$1.18.
Sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1,530,446,000 compared to $1,239,504,000 for 2003.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $46.6 million for the year 2004 when compared to 2003.
 
The Company also announced that for the first time in its history it will commence payment of a quarterly dividend on its Common Stock of $.03 per share.  The Company expects the dividend payment to be made on or about April 6, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2005.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results.  Sales were up 18% compared to last year's fourth quarter to a record $403,963,000.  The operating income margin increased from 16.8% to 18.8%.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 87% of our sales, was up a strong 20% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across the majority of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the wireless communication, military and aerospace and industrial markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, increasing our worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and improved end markets reflecting a generally stronger economy compared to the prior year.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 13% of our sales, was up 6% over
a comparatively strong quarter in the prior year; however, the operating income margins in this segment were adversely impacted by increasing material costs."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter was up 38% over last year, representing the twelfth consecutive quarterly increase and a new record for the Company.  Our operating income margin for the quarter was also strong at 18.8%, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also very strong at $69.0 million for the quarter and $202.1 million for the year 2004."
 
"We had a record year in 2004 and look to the future with great enthusiasm based on our strong position in excellent and diversified markets, our increasing presence with the major companies in these markets, our excellent product portfolio and technological capabilities, and an outstanding management team.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we believe that we can achieve an increase in revenues in 2005 in the range of 9%-12% and an increase in EPS in the range of 18%-23%.  Our confidence in the future is also reflected in our decision to commence payment of a $.03 per share quarterly dividend on the Company's Common Stock.  We are confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."
