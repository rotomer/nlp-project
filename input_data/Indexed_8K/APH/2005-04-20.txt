REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 20, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 30% to a record $.52 compared to $.40 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Sales for the first quarter 2005 increased 15% to $409,395,000 compared to $355,261,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $7.7 million in the first quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results.  Sales were up 15% compared to last year's first quarter to a record $409,395,000.  The operating income margin increased from 17.3% to 18.9%.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 16% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the industrial, wireless communication and military and aerospace markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers and our
increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets.  The improved profitability in the interconnect business is also attributable to the continuing development of new application specific products as well as higher volumes and ongoing programs of cost control.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was up 8% over the prior year."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Earnings per share for the quarter were up 30% over last year, representing the thirteenth consecutive quarterly increase and a new record for the Company.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also strong at $39 million for the quarter."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, the Company has completed three acquisitions since the beginning of this year, with aggregate annual sales of approximately $70 million.  The acquisitions complement and broaden the Company's presence in a number of market segments and include a Korean manufacturer of handset related products, a United States manufacturer of fiber optic systems for high performance military and industrial markets and a United States manufacturer of high speed, high density interconnect products for computer and communications related markets.  These acquisitions contributed approximately $8 million in sales in the first quarter of 2005.  We are excited about the growth opportunities presented by these excellent additions."
"With the first quarter results, 2005 is off to a great start.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are revising upward our expectation for full year 2005 results to a sales increase in the range of 11% to 14% and earnings per share increase in the range of 20% to 25%; this compares to our prior estimates of sales and earnings per share increases of 9% to 12% and 18% to 23%, respectively.  We expect second quarter results in the range of $430 million to $440 million and $.55 to $.57 for sales and EPS respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."
