Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 19, 2005.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $.57 compared to $.47 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Such per share amount for the third quarter of 2005 includes the one-time effects of expenses relating to the early extinguishment of debt of $.02 per share and the one-time benefit of $.02 per share relating to the reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 34% to 33% resulting from the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.    Sales for the third quarter 2005 increased 16% to $446,995,000 compared to $384,103,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $2.2 million in the third quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, diluted earnings per share was $1.67 compared to $1.31 per share for the 2004 period.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 were $1,300,032,000 compared to $1,126,483,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $17.4 million for the nine month 2005 period when compared to the 2004 period.
 
As previously announced, in the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities.  In conjunction therewith, the Company incurred one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.4 million or $.02 per share after tax.  Such one-time expenses include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements.  In addition, as noted above the Company has adjusted its effective tax rate from 34% to 33% to reflect the one-time benefit of lower United States taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings available under the provisions of the American Job Creation Act of 2004.  This lowered tax expense in the third quarter by approximately $2.2 million or $.02 per share.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our third quarter results.  Sales were up 16% compared to last year's third quarter to a record $446,995,000 and increased sequentially over the record second quarter 2005.  An excellent achievement in a seasonally slower quarter.   The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 88% of our sales, was up a strong 18% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the wireless, military and aerospace and automotive markets.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, our increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and acquisitions.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 12% of our sales, was up 9% over the prior year."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  The operating income margin increased from 18.3% a year ago to 19.3% in the third quarter of 2005.  This increase was driven by the improved profitability of the interconnect product segment offset in part by lower cable product margins, which continue to be impacted by increasing material and freight related costs.  Earnings per share for the quarter increased 21% over last year.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations was also strong at $67 million for the quarter."
 
"Last week the Company announced an agreement to acquire the Connection Systems division of Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE-TER).  Teradyne Connection Systems (TCS), a technology leader in high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products, is complementary and an excellent strategic fit with Amphenol.  The combination of TCS and Amphenol will create the world's third largest interconnect company and a new expanded platform for creating value.  We expect a closing prior to year end."
 
"It was a good quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have a strong position in excellent and diversified markets and continue to increase our presence with the major companies in these markets.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we expect a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter results in the range of $460 million to $470 million and $.59 to $.61 for sales and EPS, respectively.  The guidance
does not include any effect that may result from the acquisition of TCS.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."
