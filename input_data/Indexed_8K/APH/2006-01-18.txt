REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 18, 2006.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 20% to $.61 compared to $.51 per share for the comparable 2004 period.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2005 increased 26% to $508,115,000 compared to $403,963,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $10.4 million in the fourth quarter 2005 compared to the 2004 period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, diluted earnings per share was $2.28 compared to $1.82 per share for the 2004 period.  Sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1,808,147,000 compared to $1,530,446,000 for the 2004 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $7.0 million for the year 2005 when compared to 2004.
 
As previously announced, on December 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of the Connection Systems Division of Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE-TER) for approximately $390 million.  Amphenol TCS (TCS), headquartered in Nashua, New Hampshire, is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect products.  TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets. TCS has facilities in North America, Europe and Asia and employs approximately 2,000 people worldwide.  TCS was included in Amphenol's consolidated results beginning in December.  The fourth quarter includes TCS sales of approximately $35 million with no effect on EPS as incremental operating income was offset by incremental interest expense on borrowings to fund the acquisition.  TCS, a technology leader in high-speed, high-density, printed circuit board interconnect solutions, is complementary and an excellent strategic fit with Amphenol.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "I am extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results.  Sales were up 26% compared to last year's fourth quarter to a record $508 million.  The interconnect products segment of our business, which represents 89% of our sales,
 
was up a strong 27% over last year with excellent profitability.  The growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all major geographic regions.  Growth was especially strong in the mobile device market.  The excellent top line results reflect our continuing development of new application specific solutions and value added products for our customers, our increased worldwide presence with the leading companies in our target markets and acquisitions.  The cable products segment of our business, which is primarily for broadband cable television networks and represents 11% of our sales, was up 14% over the prior year."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  The operating income margin in the fourth quarter was 18.5% compared to 18.8% in last year's fourth quarter.  Excluding the impact of the TCS acquisition which in December had operating income margins in the 7.5% range, the fourth quarter 2005 operating income margin was 19.3%, the same as the third quarter of 2005.  I am very pleased that we have been able to sustain this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment.  The increase in operating margins over the prior year was driven by the improved profitability of the interconnect product segment offset in part by lower cable product margins, which continue to be impacted by increasing material and freight related costs.  Earnings per share for the quarter increased 20% over last year.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was also strong at $75 million."
 
"We had a record year in 2005 and look to the future with great enthusiasm.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, a strong position in diversified markets, and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  With the addition of TCS we are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we believe that we can achieve revenues and EPS in 2006 in the range of $2,250 million to $2,300 million and $2.56 to $2.63, respectively.  For the first quarter of 2006 we expect revenues and EPS in the range of $535 million to $545 million and $.57 and $.59, respectively.  As previously announced, we expect the TCS acquisition to be accretive for the full year 2006, but slightly dilutive in the first half of 2006.  EPS guidance for the year and first quarter of 2006 includes approximately $10.0 million ($.08 per share) and $2.0 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma 2005 EPS after option expense is $2.23, $.50 and $.60, for the full year, first quarter and fourth quarter, respectively.  We are very confident that we are in excellent markets with a great organization, and we are very excited about the future."

Such expense was previously disclosed in the Company's financial statement footnotes but was not included as an expense in the Company's income statement.
