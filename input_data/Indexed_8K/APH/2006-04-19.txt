REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut. April 19, 2006. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 21% to $.63 compared to $.52 per share for the comparable 2005 period. EPS for the first quarter of 2006 was reduced by approximately $1.8 million ($.01 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma first quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.50. Sales for the first quarter 2006 increased 39% to $568,991,000 compared to $409,395,000 for the 2005 period. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $10.1 million in the first quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are extremely pleased to start 2006 with a record quarter achieving sales of $569 million and earnings per share of $.63. Sales increased 39% over last year and 16% excluding the TCS acquisition. This strong performance was broad based with growth in all major market segments; with particular strength in the wireless handset and broadband communications network
markets. The TCS acquisition performed better than expectations, achieving sales of $94 million and operating margin of 10%, contributing approximately $.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. I am extremely pleased with the progress TCS has made in its first quarter as an Amphenol company. The timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future performance. In addition, in March, consistent with our strategy, the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of interconnect systems for the medical equipment market with annual sales of approximately $20 million. The acquisition complements and broadens our product offering in this important market."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. The operating income margin in the first quarter was 17.3%. Excluding the impact of the TCS acquisition, and the impact of stock option expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, the first quarter 2006 operating income margin was 19.1%; compared to 18.9% in last year's first quarter. I am very pleased that we have been able to achieve this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment. The increase in operating margins over the prior year was driven by the improved profitability of the interconnect product segment offset in part by lower cable product margins, which continue to be impacted by increasing material and freight related costs. Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was also strong at $56 million."
"We had a strong start to 2006 and look to the future with great enthusiasm. We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets, and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets. With the addition of TCS we are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2006 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,300 million to $2,345 million and $2.64 to $2.72, respectively. This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,250 million to $2,300 million and $2.56 to $2.63, respectively. For the second quarter of 2006 we expect revenues and EPS in the range of $580 million to $590 million and $.66 and $.68, respectively. EPS guidance for the year and second quarter of 2006 includes approximately $9.8 million ($.07 per share) and $2.5 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. Pro forma 2005 EPS after option expense is $2.23 and $.56, for the full year and second quarter, respectively. We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
