Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
Third Amended 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries
In January 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Amphenol Corporation (the "Company") authorized and approved the Third Amended 2000 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of Amphenol and Subsidiaries (the "Third Amended 2000 Option Plan"), subject to stockholder approval at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). The stockholders of the Company approved the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan at the Annual Meeting held on May 24, 2006.
The Third Amended 2000 Option Plan increased the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under  the Company's previously-effective option plan from 8,000,000 to 12,000,000 shares. The Third Amended 2000 Option Plan also increased the number of options that may be granted to any one participant in the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan from not more than 2,000,000 to not more than 3,000,000 options. Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan will terminate in June 2010. All other terms of the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan are the same as the Company's previously-effective option plan.
 
The Third Amended 2000 Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee will consider recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior management employees of the Company and determine those employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who will be eligible to receive options, the number and the terms and conditions of each option grant, the form of the option agreement and any conditions on the exercise of an option award. Options awarded under the Third Amended 2000 Option Plan will vest in 20% annual increments over a period of five years from the date of grant with certain exceptions including without limitation, in the case of the termination of the option holder's employment with the Company or retirement at age 65.
