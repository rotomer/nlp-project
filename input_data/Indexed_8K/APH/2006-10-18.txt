Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 18, 2006.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 28% to a record $.73 compared to $.57 per share for the comparable 2005 period.  Such per share amount for 2006 includes the effect of a $6 million or $.04 per share one-time charge relating to previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility and the benefit of $.03 per share relating to the cumulative effect of a reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 33% to 32%.  Excluding the one-time flood related charge, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2006 was $.77.   EPS for the third quarter of 2006 was also reduced by approximately $2.8 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma third quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.56.  Sales for the third quarter 2006 increased 42% to a record $636,418,000 compared to $446,995,000 for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $8.4 million in the third quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, diluted earnings per share, including flood-related charges, was $1.93 compared to $1.67 per share for the 2005 period.  Excluding flood-related charges earnings per share was $2.09.  EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was also reduced by approximately $6.7 million ($.05 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 after option expense is $1.63.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 were $1,812,007,000 compared to $1,300,032,000 for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $.4 million for the nine month 2006 period when compared to the 2005 period.
As previously announced, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period June 28 through July 1, 2006.  In the second and third quarter of 2006 the Company recorded charges of
 
$15 million or $.11 per share and $6 million or $.04 per share, respectively, for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net of expected insurance recoveries.  The Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14.  Production activity increased during the third quarter with the plant substantially back to full production during the month of September.  As a result, sales in the second and third quarter were reduced by approximately $10 and $15 million, respectively.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are extremely pleased to close a record third quarter with sales of $636 million and earnings per share before flood related losses of $.77.  Sales increased 42% over last year (14% excluding the TCS acquisition), and were up 5% sequentially, an exceptional accomplishment in what is normally a seasonally softer quarter.  This performance was led by particular strength in the communications related markets which had strong sequential growth, and more than absorbed the flood-related sales loss in the quarter in the military and aerospace market; a testament to the strength and balance of the business.  TCS continued to perform as the market leader in high-speed, high-density printed circuit board interconnect solutions, increasing third quarter sales 15%, sequentially to $126 million and improving operating margin.  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added interconnect solutions and the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future performance."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  The operating income margin in the third quarter, before flood related charges, was 18%, up from 17.8% in the second quarter, with sequential improvement in both the cable and interconnect segments of our business.  I am very pleased that we have been able to achieve this strong profitability in a difficult cost environment.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 10% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was strong at $71 million."
"It was another strong quarter and we look to the future with great enthusiasm.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we expect a strong finish to the year and are raising guidance for the fourth quarter to revenues in the range of $640 million to $650 million and EPS in the range of $.80 and $.82, respectively.  EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of 2006 includes approximately $3.1 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma fourth quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.60.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
