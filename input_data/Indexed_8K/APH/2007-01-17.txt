Amphenol                                                                       News Release

358 Hall Avenue
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 17, 2007.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share increased 39% to a record $.85 compared to $.61 per share for the comparable 2005 period.  Such per share amount for 2006 includes the benefit of $.02 per share relating to the cumulative effect of a reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 32% to 31.5%.  In addition, EPS for the fourth quarter of 2006 was reduced by approximately $3.0 million ($.02 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma fourth quarter 2005 EPS after option expense is $.60.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2006 increased 30% (16% excluding the TCS acquisition) to a record $659.4 million compared to $508.1 million for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.2 million in the fourth quarter 2006 compared to the 2005 period.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, diluted earnings per share, including flood-related charges of $.15 described below, was $2.79 compared to $2.28 per share for the 2005 period.  Excluding flood-related charges earnings per share was $2.94.  EPS for 2006 was also reduced by approximately $9.7 million ($.07 per share) relating to stock option expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R.  Pro forma EPS for 2005 after option expense is $2.23.  Sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 37% (14% excluding the TCS acquisition) to $2,471.4 million compared to $1,808.1 million for the 2005 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.5 million for the 2006 period when compared to the 2005 period.
As previously announced, the Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in New York State during the period June 28 through July 1, 2006.  During 2006, in the second and third quarter, the Company recorded charges of $21 million or $.15 per share for recovery and clean up expenses and property related
damage, net of expected insurance recoveries.  As previously reported the Sidney facility was substantially back to full production during the month of September.
The Company also announced that it will effect a 2 for 1 stock split for shareholders of record as of March 16, 2007.  The Company expects the additional shares will be distributed on or about March 30, 2007.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "Amphenol has finished 2006 with another record performance with fourth quarter sales of $659 million and earnings per share of $.85.  Sales grew 30% over last year (16% excluding the TCS acquisition), and were up 4% sequentially.  Growth was broad based across all of our end markets and included all geographic regions.  Our performance was led by particular strength in the communications related markets and an excellent contribution from the military, aerospace and industrial markets; as we came back to full production after the flood."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 18.9% in the fourth quarter, representing both a sequential and year over year increase.  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added interconnect solutions and the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter to more than offset the difficulties of the current cost environment and provide a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, exceeded 11% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $76 million and for the year was $290 million exceeding net income.  During the year we have continued to deploy our strong cash flow to create additional value."
"We had a record year in 2006 and we look to the future with great enthusiasm.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Our enthusiasm and confidence in the future is also reflected in our decision to effect a 2 for 1 stock split in the first quarter of 2007, which should further improve the liquidity and trading in our stock.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we believe we can achieve revenues and EPS in 2007 of $2,650 million to $2,710 million and $3.45 to $3.55, respectively, an increase of 7% to 10% and 17% to 21% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood related charges, respectively.  For the first quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $635 million to $645 million and EPS in the range of $.80 and $.82, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
