Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 18, 2007.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 39% to $.43 compared to $.31 per share for the comparable 2006 period.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Such per share amount for 2007 includes the benefit of $.01 per share relating to a reduction in tax expense of approximately $1.5 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company's prior year tax returns.  Sales for the first quarter 2007 increased 14% to $651.0 million compared to $569.0 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $14.5 million in the first quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to have a strong start in 2007 with first quarter sales of $651 million and earnings per share of $.43.  Sales grew 14% over last year.  Growth was broad based and well balanced across all of our end markets and included all geographic regions.  Both segments of the business performed well in the first quarter.  The interconnect segment of our business (approximately 90% of sales) grew 15% over last year and the cable segment of our business (approximately 10% of sales) grew 10%.  Our strong growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 18.8% in the first quarter compared to 17.3% in the first quarter of 2006.  The combination of strong top line growth focused on value added application specific products together with a strong focus on the timely implementation of cost reduction and other profit improvement actions contributed significantly in the quarter and provide a solid base for future
 
performance.  Furthermore, net income, that is income after interest expense and taxes, was approximately 12% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $62 million."
"The first quarter was good in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major companies in these markets.  We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2007 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,670 million to $2,715 million and $1.75 to $1.80, respectively, an increase of 8% to 10% and 19% to 22% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood related charges, respectively.  This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,650 million to $2,710 million and $1.73 to $1.78, respectively.  For the second quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $670 million to $685 million and EPS in the range of $.43 and $.45, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
