REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut. October 17, 2007. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $.50 compared to $.39 per share for the comparable 2006 period before flood-related charges. Such per share amount for 2006 excludes the effect of a $5.7 million one-time charge relating to previously announced flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility. Including such charge, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2006 was $.36. (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2 for 1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Sales for the third quarter 2007 increased 15% to $733.9 million compared to $636.4 million for the 2006 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16.3 million in the third quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, diluted earnings per share was $1.39 compared to $1.04 per share before flood-related charges for the 2006 period. Including flood-related charges, diluted earnings per share for the 2006 period was $.97. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were $2,073.8 million compared to $1,812.0 million for the 2006 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $43.8 million for the nine month 2007 period when compared to the 2006 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to close a record third quarter with sales of $734 million and earnings per share of $.50. Sales grew 15% over last year. Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the military and commercial aerospace, automotive and mobile device markets reflecting the impact of multiple new program ramp ups. All geographic regions of the business performed well in the quarter. During the quarter, consistent with our strategy, the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of interconnect products for the geophysical exploration industry with annual sales of approximately $35 million. We are excited
about the growth potential created by this excellent addition. Our strong organic growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong. Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.5% compared to 18.0% in the third quarter of 2006 (before flood-related charges for the 2006 period). The combination of strong top line growth based on value added application specific products together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost contributed significantly to our results in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance. Furthermore, net income exceeded 12% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $109 million."
 
"The third quarter was good in all respects. I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well. We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major customers in these markets. We are the world's third largest interconnect company with an expanded platform for creating value. Assuming a continuation of the current economic climate and relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2007 to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $2,814 million to $2,829 million and $1.89 to $1.91, respectively, an increase of 14% and 29% to 30% over 2006 revenues and EPS before flood-related charges, respectively. This compares to the Company's previous guidance of revenues and EPS in the range of $2,710 million to $2,750 million and $1.79 to $1.83, respectively. For the fourth quarter 2007 we expect revenues in the range of $740 million to $755 million and EPS in the range of $.50 and $.52, respectively. We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our excellent organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
