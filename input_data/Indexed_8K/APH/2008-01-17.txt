REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 17, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $.55 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2006 period.  (All per share amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the Company's 2-for-1 stock split effective in March 2007.)  Sales for the fourth quarter 2007 increased 18% to $777.3 million compared to $659.4 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $22 million in the fourth quarter 2007 compared to the 2006 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2007, diluted earnings per share was $1.94 compared to $1.47 per share before flood-related charges for the 2006 period.  Including flood-related charges, diluted earnings per share for the 2006 period was $1.39.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2007 were $2,851.0 million compared to $2,471.4 million for the 2006 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $66 million for the full year 2007 period when compared to the 2006 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are pleased to close a record fourth quarter with sales of $777 million and earnings per share of $.55.  Sales grew 18% over last year.  Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the mobile device, military and commercial aerospace, and wireless infrastructure markets.  All geographic regions of the business performed well in the quarter.  Our strong growth reflects our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"Consistent with our strategy the Company completed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007 with aggregate annual sales of approximately $45 million.  The acquisitions complement and broaden the Company's presence in a number of market segments and include a Northwest China based manufacturer of RF interconnect products for the wireless communications market
 
 
and a Chinese manufacturer of precision interconnect products for IT and consumer product applications.  In addition, during the quarter the Company completed the purchase of the remaining minority interest in one of its Korean manufacturers of handset related products.  We are excited about the growth potential created by these excellent additions."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.7% compared to 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The combination of strong top line growth based on value added application specific products together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost contributed significantly to our results in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's excellent profitability.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $133 million."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  We have an outstanding management team, excellent technological capabilities, leading positions in diversified markets and an increasing presence with the major customers in these markets.  The growth we achieved in the fourth quarter and full year is very satisfying and is a direct result of implementing our strategies.  Looking forward, the general economic environment appears to have become more uncertain in recent weeks, particularly in the United States.  This weakness, combined with the relatively unstable financial markets may have a dampening effect on the expansion of certain segments of the economy.  Nevertheless, we believe the diversity of our customer base, leading technology, excellent product portfolio, worldwide presence and lean cost structure will serve us well in such an environment, and we are cautiously optimistic about continuing improvement in the short term and very confident about the long term outlook for continued growth and profitability. Accordingly, while market conditions are uncertain, and based on relatively stable currency exchange rates, we expect to achieve revenues and EPS in 2008 of $3,100 million to $3,175 million and $2.18 to $2.25, respectively, an increase of 9% to 11% and 12% to 16% over 2007 revenues and EPS, respectively.  For the first quarter 2008 we expect revenues in the range of $740 million to $755 million and EPS in the range of $.50 and $.52, respectively.  We are very excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
