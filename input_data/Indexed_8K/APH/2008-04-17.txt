REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 17, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that first quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $.54 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Sales for the first quarter 2008 increased 18% to $770.7 million compared to $651.0 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $22 million in the first quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2008 with first quarter sales of $771 million and earnings per share of $.54.  Sales grew 18% over last year.  Growth was broad based reflecting the benefits of a diverse market footprint with particular strength in the mobile device, wireless infrastructure, military and commercial aerospace markets.  All geographic regions of the business performed well in the quarter.  Our strong growth reflects the results of our continued commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers in all of our markets."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, during the first quarter of 2008 the Company completed the acquisition of a French manufacturer of value added interconnect and electronic packaging solutions for the aerospace market with aggregate annual sales of approximately $28 million. The acquisition broadens the Company's technology offering in this important growth market."
 
"In addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage in the quarter with an operating income margin of 19.5% compared to 18.8% in the first quarter of 2007.  The combination of strong top line growth together with a continued strong focus on all elements of cost contributed significantly to our results in the quarter and provides a solid base for future performance.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's
 
successful drive for value creation.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, with cash flow from operations remaining strong in the quarter at $110 million."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well.  The growth we achieved in the first quarter is very satisfying and is a direct result of implementing our strategies.  While economic uncertainties are broadly reported, and despite a continued generally moderate demand environment in certain markets, we continue to see strength in our business.  We believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our increasing position with our customers in diverse markets, leading technology, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and entrepreneurial management. Accordingly, while general economic conditions are uncertain, and based on relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance to achieve revenues and EPS in 2008 of $3,213 million to $3,258 million and $2.26 to $2.31, respectively, an increase of 13% to 14% and 16% to 19% over 2007 revenues and EPS, respectively.  For the second quarter 2008 we expect revenues in the range of $805 million to $820 million and EPS in the range of $.57 and $.59, respectively.  We are excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
