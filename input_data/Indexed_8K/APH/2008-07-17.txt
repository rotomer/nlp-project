REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  July 17, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that second quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 33% to $.61 compared to $.46 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Sales for the second quarter 2008 increased 23% to $846.8 million compared to $688.8 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $26.5 million in the second quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, diluted earnings per share was $1.15 compared to $.89 per share for the 2007 period.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2008 were $1,617.5 million compared to $1,339.9 million for the 2007 period.   Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $48.1 million for the six month 2008 period when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report a record second quarter with sales of $847 million and earnings per share of $.61.  Sales grew 23% over last year.  Growth was broad based with particular strength in the global communications, military and commercial aerospace markets.  It is extremely rewarding that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, our strategy of ongoing market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, during the second quarter of 2008 the Company completed the acquisition of a United States manufacturer of audio interconnect products for the military market with aggregate annual sales of approximately $14 million. This acquisition broadens the Company's technology offering in this important market."
 
 
 
 
 
"We are especially encouraged that, in addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter.  Amphenol achieved excellent operating leverage with an operating income margin of 19.9% compared to 19.4% in the second quarter of 2007.  We were able to more than offset significant inflationary pressures with the combination of our strong top line growth and a continued focus on all elements of cost.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's successful drive for value creation.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, with cash flow from operations remaining strong in the quarter at $96 million.  The financial strength of the Company in the quarter provides a solid base for future performance."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a challenging environment.  The growth we achieved in the second quarter is very satisfying and is a direct result of consistently implementing our strategies.  While economic uncertainties continue to be broadly reported, and despite a generally moderate demand environment in certain markets, we continue to see strength in our business.  We believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and entrepreneurial management. Accordingly, while general economic conditions are uncertain, and based on relatively stable currency exchange rates, we are raising our guidance to achieve revenues and EPS in 2008 of $3,278 million to $3,308 million and $2.34 to $2.38, respectively, an increase of 15% to 16% and 21% to 23% over 2007 revenues and EPS, respectively.  For the third quarter 2008 we expect revenues in the range of $825 million to $840 million and EPS in the range of $.59 and $.61, respectively.  We are excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
