REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  October 16, 2008.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that third quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $.63 compared to $.50 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Sales for the third quarter 2008 increased 18% to $863.7 million compared to $733.9 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $16 million in the third quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, diluted earnings per share was $1.78 compared to $1.39 per share for the 2007 period.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were $2,481.2 million compared to $2,073.8 million for the 2007 period.   Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $64 million for the nine month 2008 period when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Chairman and CEO, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report record third quarter results with sales of $864 million and earnings per share of $.63.  Sales grew 18% over last year.  Growth was broad based with particular strength in the global communications, military and aerospace markets.  It is extremely rewarding that even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, our strategy of ongoing market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities."
 
"We are especially encouraged that, in addition to excellent overall top line growth, profitability and cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter.  Amphenol achieved
excellent operating leverage with an operating income margin of 19.8% compared to 19.5% in the third quarter of 2007.  We were able to more than offset significant inflationary pressures with the combination of our strong top line growth and a continued focus on all elements of cost.  Furthermore, net income was approximately 13% of sales, another indication of the Company's successful drive for value creation.  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, with cash flow from operations remaining strong in the quarter at $105 million.  The sustained financial strength of the Company provides a solid base for future performance."
 
"I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a challenging environment.  The third quarter results are very satisfying and are a direct result of consistently implementing our strategies."
 
"During the last month macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated further as disruptions in financial markets and lack of availability of credit have spread globally.  As a result, the outlook for economic growth has been reduced and the downside risk to growth has increased.  While the current environment is expected by many to have a dampening effect on demand, we believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and entrepreneurial management. Accordingly, we are confirming the high end and narrowing the range of our 2008 guidance to achieve revenues and EPS in the range of $3,292 million to $3,308 million and $2.36 to $2.38, respectively, an increase of 15% to 16% over 2007 revenues and 22% to 23% over 2007 EPS, respectively. This outlook is based on the Company's strong third quarter performance and a fourth quarter that incorporates the impact of current currency exchange rates which reflect a significantly stronger U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter 2008 we now expect revenues in the range of $810 million to $826 million and EPS in the range of $.58 and $.60, respectively.  Forecasting in the current unstable economic environment is difficult; however, we are excited about the future and confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented and to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us."
