REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 15, 2009.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today that fourth quarter 2008 diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $.56 compared to $.55 per share for the comparable 2007 period.  Such per share amount for 2008 includes the benefit of $.03 per share relating to the cumulative effect of a reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 29% to 28%.  Sales for the fourth quarter 2008 decreased 3% to $755.3 million compared to $777.3 million for the 2007 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 4% or $29.7 million in the fourth quarter 2008 compared to the 2007 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2008, diluted earnings per share was $2.34 compared to $1.94 per share for the 2007 period.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2008 were $3,236.5 million compared to $2,851.0 million for the 2007 period.   Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 1% or $34.3 million for the full year 2008 period when compared to the 2007 period.
 
Amphenol Executive Chairman, Martin H. Loeffler, stated:  "We are very pleased to report fourth quarter results with sales of $755 million, operating income margin of 18.9% and earnings per share of $.56, a strong performance given the very challenging environment. On a local currency basis, sales were down about 9% sequentially from the third quarter of 2008 reflecting the sudden and severe slowdown in demand in most markets particularly in automotive and communications related markets.   Sales were approximately equal to prior year levels in local currencies with strength in global wireless communications and military and aerospace markets, offsetting declines in the automotive, industrial and IT and data com equipment markets. While our fourth quarter results have certainly been impacted by the well publicized economic slowdown, the results continue to show the significant benefits of the Company's diversity. In addition, it is extremely rewarding that even in this difficult environment, profitability and cash flow remain
 
 
strong.  Our experienced operating management team has reacted swiftly to the softening demand with a strong focus on cost reductions, including a headcount reduction of about 17% of our total workforce in the quarter.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well in a challenging environment."
 
"Effective January 1
st
, in accordance with our previously announced succession plan, R. Adam Norwitt succeeded me as CEO of Amphenol.  I am confident that under his leadership Amphenol can look forward to a very prosperous future.  I will continue as Executive Chairman to support our mission to achieve our long term goals."
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt stated: "Consistent with our strategy, at the end of the quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of a high technology manufacturer of antenna products for the wireless infrastructure market with annual sales of approximately $50 million. We are excited by the potential created by this excellent addition to our wireless technology offering."
 
"While economic conditions are uncertain and based on current currency exchange rates, we anticipate a further moderation in demand in Q1 2009.  Accordingly, we expect revenues for Q1 2009 in the range of $650 million to $665 million and EPS in the range of $.39 and $.41.  Forecasting in the current economic environment is increasingly difficult given the significant uncertainty regarding future demand levels.  As a result, until market conditions become more predictable, the Company will not be providing sales and EPS guidance beyond the next quarter. While the difficult economic environment has a dampening effect on current demand, we believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and dynamic entrepreneurial management."
 
"We continue to be excited about the futureThe strength of our management team and the sustained financial strength of the Company provide a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to meet the challenges presented, to preserve profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
