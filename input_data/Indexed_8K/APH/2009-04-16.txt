REPORTED BY AMPHENOL CORPORATION
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  April 16, 2009.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share of $.43 compared to $.54 per share for the comparable 2008 period.  Such per share amount for 2009 includes the benefit of $.02 per share relating to a reduction in tax expense of approximately $3.6 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the Company's prior year tax returns.  Sales for the first quarter 2009 decreased 14% to $660.0 million compared to $770.7 million for the 2008 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 3% or $23.1 million in the first quarter 2009 compared to the 2008 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt stated "We are very pleased to start 2009 with first quarter results that confirm once again the Company's ability to perform well in all economic cycles.  The Company's achievement of sales of $660 million, with operating income margin of 16.8% and earnings per share of $.43, is very satisfying given the challenging market environment. While these first quarter results have certainly been impacted by the global economic slowdown, our performance continues to show the benefits of the Company's diversity and the strength of its technology.  Significant sales declines resulting from continued low market demand levels in the automotive, industrial and information technology and data communication equipment markets were partially offset by sales increases in the global wireless communications markets, particularly in China, and a relatively flat performance in the defense and aerospace market.  Our team was able to capitalize on pockets of strength in nearly all of our served markets to preserve and grow our market position.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that even in this difficult environment, profitability and cash flow remain strong.  Our operating management team continues to adjust costs in a proactive and dynamic manner contributing to the strength of our financial performance.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
"Consistent with our strategy, at the end of the quarter, the Company completed the acquisition of Times Microwave Systems (TMS), a world leader in high performance radio frequency value-added interconnect technology for the military aerospace and wireless communications markets.  TMS had annual sales of approximately $108 million in 2008. We are excited by the growth potential created through the combination of our complementary technologies in these important markets. In addition, we are pleased that our financial strength allows us to continue to expand the opportunities for future growth through our ongoing acquisition program."
 
"While economic conditions remain uncertain, we anticipate a continuation of moderate demand in Q2 2009.  Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates we expect revenues for Q2 2009 in the range of $660 million to $675 million and EPS in the range of $.41 to $.43.  Given the significant uncertainty regarding future demand levels the Company will continue to only provide sales and EPS guidance for the next quarter at this time.  While the challenging economic environment has a dampening effect on current demand, we believe we can perform well in such an environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure and an agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
 "We continue to be excited about the future.Our competitive advantages and sustained financial strength provide a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the challenges presented, to preserve profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
