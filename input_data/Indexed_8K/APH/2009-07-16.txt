The Company's achievement of sales of $685 million, with an operating income margin of 16.9% and earnings per share of $.43, is very gratifying given the continued challenges in the market environment.  Our performance continues to show the benefits of the Company's diversity and the strength of its technology. While demand levels remain low, we did experience sequential sales increases in most end markets,particularly inthe automotive, mobile device, military aerospace, and broadband markets.  We were able to capitalize on pockets of strength and enhance our market position in nearly all of our served markets.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that even in this difficult environment, profitability and cash flow remain strong.  Our management team continues to reduce costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
 
 "While economic conditions remain uncertain, we believe we have seen a stabilization of demand in most markets.  Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates and some seasonal moderation we expect Q3 2009 revenues in the range of $670 million to $685 million and EPS in the range of $.41 to $.43.  We continue to believe we can perform well in the current economic environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
 "We continue to be excited about the future.Our competitive advantages and sustained financial strength provide a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
