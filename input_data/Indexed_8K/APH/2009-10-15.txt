Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report third quarter results that exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance with sales of $717 million, an operating income margin of 17.3% and earnings per share of $.47.  Strengthening demand in the Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Mobile Devices market and Automotive market drove a 5% sequential increase in sales and a 12% sequential increase in orders over Q2 of 2009.  The Company achieved a book to bill ratio of 1.04 to 1, the first positive ratio since the beginning of the economic downturn in late Q3 of 2008.   It is very gratifying, given the continued challenges in the market environment, that we were able to capitalize on pockets of strength and enhance our market position in nearly all of our served markets.   In addition, it is extremely rewarding that our focus on operating leverage and working capital management enabled us to further expand margins and generate strong cash flow.  Our management team continues to control costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
 
"While economic conditions remain less than certain, we believe we have seen a stabilization of demand in most markets and an improvement in demand in some markets. Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates and a continuation of improving demand trends, we expect Q4 2009 revenues in the range of $720 million to $735 million and EPS in the range of $.47 to $.49.  We continue to believe we can perform well in the current environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"We continue to be excited about the future.Our competitive advantages and sustained financial strength provide a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
