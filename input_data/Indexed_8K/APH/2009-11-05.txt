Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 5, 2009, Amphenol Corporation (the "Company") issued and sold $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.75% Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-162722), including the related Prospectus dated October 29, 2009, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated October 29, 2009.  The Notes were sold in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated October 29, 2009, by and between the Company and Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as representatives of the several Underwriters named in Schedule A thereto.
 
The Notes were sold to the public at a price of 99.813% of the principal amount, and the Company received net proceeds of approximately $594.5 million from the offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.  The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility.  In conjunction with the repayment, the Company expects to terminate certain interest rate swap agreements and incur a one-time charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.02 per share, relating to the cost of such termination.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of November 5, 2009 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and certain of the terms of the Notes were established pursuant to an Officers' Certificate dated November 5, 2009 (the "Officers' Certificate") in accordance with the Indenture.  The Indenture and Officers' Certificate contain certain covenants and events of default and other customary provisions.
 
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year.  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2010.  The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1.  The Notes will mature on November 15, 2014.  The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at any time by paying a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.  The Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
 
The above descriptions of the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate and the Notes, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and are incorporated by reference herein.

A director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under this Note or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.  Each Holder by accepting the Note waives and releases all such liability.  The waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issue of the Note.
 
The registered Holder of this Note shall be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
 
If funds for the payment of principal or interest remain unclaimed for two years, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will repay the funds to the Company at its written request.  After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying Agent with respect to such funds shall cease.
