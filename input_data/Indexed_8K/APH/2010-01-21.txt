EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut.  January 21, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today fourth quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share of $.50 compared to $.56 per share for the comparable 2008 period. Such per share amount for the 2009 period included a one-time charge of $.02 per share relating to the termination of certain interest rate swap agreements as part of the refinancing associated with the Company's $600 million senior note issuance in November.   Such per share amount for the 2008 period included the benefit of $.03 per share relating to the cumulative reduction in the Company's effective tax rate from 29% to 28%. Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.52 and $.53 for the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Sales for the fourth quarter 2009 were $758.3 million compared to $755.3 million for the 2008 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 2% or $17.7 million in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the 2008 period.
 
For the full year ended December 31, 2009, diluted earnings per share, excluding the one-time charge relating to the refinancing referenced above, was $1.85 compared to $2.34 for 2008.  Sales for the full year ended December 31, 2009 were $2,820.1 million compared to $3,236.5 million for 2008. Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $38.2 million for the full year 2009 period when compared to 2008.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to close 2009 with strong fourth quarter results that exceeded the high end of the Company's guidance.  This represents our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in sales and income, with sales of $758 million, an operating income margin of 18.3% and earnings per share of $.52 (excluding the one-time item).  The 6% sequential sales increase was driven by strengthening demand in most markets including: Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Military/Aerospace, Industrial, Wireless Infrastructure and Automotive.  It is very gratifying that we have been able to enhance our market position in nearly all of our served markets. Our strategy of ongoing market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers continues to
expand the Company's growth opportunities.  In addition, it is extremely rewarding that our focus on operating leverage and working capital management enabled us to further expand margins and generate strong cash flow.  Even with this improvement in demand, our management team continues to control costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"While overall economic conditions remain less than certain, we believe we have seen both an improvement in demand levels as well as a stabilization of demand patterns in most markets.  As such, in 2010, we expect to see a return to more traditional seasonality.  Accordingly, based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q1 2010 revenues in the range of $735 million to $750 million and EPS in the range of $.49 to $.51.  We believe we can perform well in the current environment due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"We continue to be excited about the future. Our significant actions in 2009 to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
