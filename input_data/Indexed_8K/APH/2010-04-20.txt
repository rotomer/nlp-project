EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut, April 20, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share of $.56 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2009 period. Such per share amounts for both periods include benefits relating to a reduction in tax expense for tax reserve adjustments relating primarily to the completion of the audits of certain prior year tax returns.  Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.55 and $.41 for the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Sales for the first quarter 2010 were $771.0 million compared to $660.0 million for the 2009 period.  Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately 2% or $15 million in the first quarter 2010 compared to the 2009 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to start 2010 with strong first quarter results exceeding the high end of the Company's guidance.  Orders of $829 million and sales of $771 million grew 8% and 2% sequentially, and increased 31% and 17% compared to the prior year.   The sales increase was driven by strengthening demand in a diverse range of our end markets including: Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Automotive, Industrial, and Broadband. Our strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with a strong commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers enabled the Company to capitalize on an improving overall demand environment.  In addition, we are expanding the Company's growth opportunities through accelerated efforts to penetrate new markets, new customers and new applications.  We were especially pleased that our unwavering focus on operating leverage enabled us to further expand margins to 18.8% in the quarter up from 18.3% last quarter and 16.8% last year, contributing to a 34% year over year increase in earnings per share, net of tax items.  Even with the improvement in demand, our management team continues to control costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash in all cycles.  Cash flow from operations remained strong in the quarter at $114 million."
 
"Consistent with our strategy, in early April, the Company completed the acquisition of an Asian manufacturer of specialty industrial interconnect products with sales of approximately $25 million.  We are pleased with this complementary addition and are excited about the growth potential in this important market."
 
"The first quarter was an excellent quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization which has executed well in all phases of the recent economic downturn and subsequent recovery.  While overall economic conditions have improved, the degree of recovery in 2010 remains less than certain. However, assuming a continuation of the current improved economic climate and based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q2 2010 revenues in the range of $820 million to $835 million and EPS in the range of $.60 to $.62."
 
"Looking forward, in an improving world economy, we see a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol.  Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
