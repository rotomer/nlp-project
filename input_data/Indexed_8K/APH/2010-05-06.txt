Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
This Form 8-K/A amends the Form 8-K filed by Amphenol Corporation on April 20, 2010 to amend certain line items on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flow in connection with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-16, . The Company adopted ASU 2009-16 on January 1, 2010.  As a result, transfers of receivables occurring on or after January 1, 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow (resulting in a reduction of cash flows provided by operating activities of $82 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2010).  The resulting changes made to the line items on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flow to properly present the adoption of ASU 2009-16 are as follows.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE 1
          
The Company has a $100 million receivables securitization program.  In accordance with previous accounting guidance, this facility was accounted for off balance sheet as a sale of receivables.  Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the amendments to the Transfers and Servicing and Consolidation Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. The adoption of these amendments has resulted in the Company reporting transactions under this facility as short-term debt and the related receivables remain on the balance sheet.  At March 31, 2010, borrowings under the securitization facility were $49 million.
