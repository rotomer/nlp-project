FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Wallingford, Connecticut, July 21, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today second quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share of $.74 compared to $.43 per share for the comparable 2009 period. Such per share amount for the 2010 quarter includes a $10 million, or $.06 per share, net benefit relating to a reduction in international tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding this effect, diluted earnings per share was $.68. Sales for the second quarter 2010 were $885 million compared to $685 million for the 2009 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately ..4% or $3 million in the second quarter 2010 compared to the 2009 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, diluted earnings per share was $1.30 compared to $.86 for the 2009 period.  Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2010 were $1,656 million compared to $1,345 million for the 2009 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $12 million for the six month 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "The second quarter established a new record of performance for Amphenol, with sales of $885 million and EPS of $.68. Sales and EPS (excluding tax items) grew 15% and 24% sequentially, and increased 29% and 58% compared to the prior year.   The sales increase was driven by healthy demand in all of our end markets led by: Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Industrial, Automotive, and Wireless Devices. We are especially encouraged that orders continued to be strong with a book to bill of 1.03.  Our strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with a deep commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers enabled the Company to capitalize on the favorable market environment. Through implementation of our strategy, we continue to expand the Company's growth opportunities into new markets, customers and applications.  We are especially pleased that even with the significant improvement in demand, our management team continues to control
 
 
costs in a proactive and dynamic manner ensuring the strength of our financial performance. This focus on operating leverage enabled us to further expand margins for the fifth consecutive quarter to 19.8% in Q2 2010 up from 18.8% last quarter and 16.9% last year, contributing to a 58% year over year increase in earnings per share, net of tax items. In addition, we generated a strong $104 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter, demonstrating the ongoing quality of the Company's earnings."
 
"Earlier this month, the Company completed the acquisition of Borisch Manufacturing, a leading U.S. manufacturer of value-add interconnect and electro-mechanical systems for the military/aerospace market with sales in the last twelve months of approximately $100 million.  This acquisition, is consistent with our long-established strategy of offering highly engineered, value-add interconnect solutions to military/aerospace customers, and creates further strength for us in this important market.  We are pleased with this complementary addition and are excited about the growth potential created in this important market."
 
"The second quarter was an excellent quarter in all respects.  I am very proud of our organization which has executed well in all phases of the recent economic downturn and subsequent recovery.  While overall conditions have improved, worldwide economic conditions remain less than certain for the remainder of 2010. Nevertheless, assuming a continuation of the current improved economic climate and normal summer seasonality in North America and Europe, and based on constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q3 2010 revenues in the range of $880 million to $895 million and EPS in the range of $.67 to $.69."
 
"Looking forward, the continued proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol.  Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on opportunities to expand our market position."
