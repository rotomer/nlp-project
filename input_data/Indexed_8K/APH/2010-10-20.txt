Wallingford, Connecticut, October 20, 2010.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today third quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share of $.78 compared to $.47 per share for the comparable 2009 period. Such per share amount for the 2010 quarter includes an $8 million, or $.05 per share, net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding this effect, diluted earnings per share was $.73.  Sales for the third quarter 2010 were $948.5 million compared to $716.6 million for the 2009 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately 1% or $7 million in the third quarter 2010 compared to the 2009 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, diluted earnings per share was $2.08 compared to $1.33 for the 2009 period.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were $2,604.2 million compared to $2,061.8 million for the 2009 period. Currency translation had the effect of increasing sales by approximately $5 million for the nine month 2010 period compared to the 2009 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "Amphenol achieved another record performance in the third quarter, with sales of $948 million and EPS of $.73 net of tax items.  Sales and EPS grew 32% and 55% over last year as the Company continued to build upon its position in its target markets.   Our strategy of market and geographic diversification, combined with a deep commitment to develop performance enhancing technologies for our customers, enabled the Company to capitalize on the favorable market environment and drive strong demand in all of our end markets led by: Industrial, Information Technology and Data Communications Equipment, Wireless Devices, Military/Aerospace and Wireless Infrastructure.  In addition, in an environment of increasing global inflationary pressures, our management team continued to proactively and dynamically manage costs creating excellent operating leverage and
 
expanding operating margins by 2.6% to 19.9% in Q3 2010 from 17.3% last year, contributing to a 55% year over year increase in earnings per share, net of tax items. Further, cash flow from operations in the quarter was a strong $128 million, demonstrating the ongoing quality of the Company's earnings."
 
"The record performance we achieved in the third quarter is a direct result of the implementation of our strategies by our worldwide organization, which continues to execute well in all economic environments. While global demand has significantly increased in the last several quarters, there remains a degree of uncertainty in the worldwide economy. Therefore, on the basis of the current economic climate and assuming constant currency exchange rates, we expect Q4 2010 revenues in the range of $933 million to $948 million and EPS in the range of $.71 to $.73."
 
"Looking forward, regardless of any near-term economic uncertainties, the accelerating  proliferation of new electronics in all of our end markets presents a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol.  Our significant actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created an even stronger base for Amphenol's future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding organization to dynamically adjust to the continued changing market environment, to generate strong profitability and to capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."
