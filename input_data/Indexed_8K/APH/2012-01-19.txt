Exhibit 99.1
           
Press Release dated January 19, 2012
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
Date:  January 19, 2012
 

Exhibit 12.1
 
 
(1)  For the years ended December 31, 2006 through 2008, earnings consist of income before income taxes plus fixed charges (income before income taxes for these periods include the adjustment for noncontrolling interests as those financial statements have not been retroactively restated in accordance with the standards of the Consolidations Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification). 
 
(2) Fixed charges consist of interest expense including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and one third of rental expenses on operating leases, representing that portion of rent expense which management believes is representative of the interest component of rent expense.  Program fees on the sales of accounts receivable are not included, as they do not meet the definition of fixed charges per Item 601 of Regulation S-K.
