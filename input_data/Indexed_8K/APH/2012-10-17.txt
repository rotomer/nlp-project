Wallingford Connecticut, October 17, 2012.  Amphenol Corporation (NYSE-APH) reported today third quarter 2012 record diluted earnings per share of $.90 compared to $.79 per share for the comparable 2011 period.  Such per share amount for the 2011 quarter includes the effect of a $13 million ($8 million after tax), or $.05 per share one-time charge relating to flood damage at the Company's Sidney, New York facility and a $4 million, or $.03 per share, net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the completion of prior year audits.  Excluding these effects, diluted earnings per share was $.81 for the 2011 period. Sales for the third quarter 2012 were a record $1.103 billion compared to $1.033 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $19 million in the third quarter 2012 compared to the 2011 period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, diluted earnings per share were $2.53 compared to $2.36 for the 2011 period on an as reported basis and $2.32 for the 2011 period excluding one-time items. One-time items in the 2011 period of $.04 include the $.02 net third quarter charge described above and a $.06 per share gain related to the adjustment of a contingent purchase price obligation for a 2010 acquisition.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $3.146 billion compared to $2.991 billion for the 2011 period.  Currency translation had the effect of decreasing sales by approximately $42 million for the nine month 2012 period compared to the 2011 period.
 
Amphenol President and Chief Executive Officer, R. Adam Norwitt, stated "We are pleased to report new records of performance in the third quarter of 2012 with sales and EPS of $1.103 billion and $.90, respectively.  Sales increased by approximately 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced strength in the automotive, industrial, commercial aerospace and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets.  On a sequential basis the Company saw strong growth in mobile devices primarily related to ramp ups of new mobile computing devices.  Our strong growth is once again confirmation of the significant benefits of the Company's diversity, especially given the increasing level of uncertainty in many of the world's economies.
 
In addition, it is extremely rewarding that the Company's unique entrepreneurial culture continues to drive an unwavering focus on profitability and cash flow, resulting in another sequential operating margin improvement to 19.5% and strong operating cash flow in the quarter of $176 million.  I am very proud of our organization as we continue to execute well."
 
"Our ongoing strategy of market and geographic diversification combined with our strong commitment to developing enabling technologies for our customers in all markets, both through organic product development and through our acquisition program, continues to expand the Company's growth opportunities.  Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, the Company completed the acquisitions of Holland Electronics, a leading U.S. supplier of interconnect products for the broadband and satellite communications markets with annual sales of approximately $60 million, and Griffith Enterprises, a U.S. manufacturer of high-technology, value-added assemblies, primarily for commercial aerospace applications, with annual sales of approximately $15 million.  These acquisitions significantly enhance the Company's product portfolio in two important end markets providing new highly-engineered interconnect solutions to complement our broadband cable offering and expanding our value-add solutions for the fast growing commercial air market.  In addition to our successful acquisition program, the Company continues to deploy its financial strength in a variety of other ways to increase shareholder value.  These include the purchase in this quarter of .5 million shares of the Company's stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plan as well as the previously announced increase in the quarterly dividend to $.105 per share effective for dividends paid after March 2012."
 
"In recent months there has been an increasing level of market uncertainty related to a range of fiscal and budgetary issues.  Based on these considerations and assuming current currency exchange rates we expect fourth quarter 2012 revenues in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.115 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $.88 to $.91  For the full year 2012, we now expect to achieve revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.241 billion to $4.261 billion and $3.41  to $3.44, respectively, an increase in revenues of 8% and in diluted EPS (excluding one-time items), of 12% to 13% over 2011. This compares to prior full year 2012 guidance for revenues and diluted EPS in the range of $4.210 billion to $4.250 billion and $3.38 to $3.44, respectively.  Despite the many uncertainties in the global marketplace, we believe we can perform well in the dynamic electronics market due to our leading technology, increasing positions with our customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, lean cost structure, and agile, experienced and entrepreneurial management team."
 
"The electronics revolution continues to accelerate, with new applications and higher performance requirements driving increased demand for our leading interconnect technologies in all of our end markets.  This creates a significant, long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Importantly, our ongoing actions to enhance our competitive advantages and build sustained financial strength have created a solid base for future performance.  I amconfident in the ability of our outstanding management team to dynamically adjust to a constantly changing market environment, to continue to generate strong profitability and to further capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position."
