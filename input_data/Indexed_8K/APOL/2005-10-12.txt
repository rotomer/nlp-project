Specific forward-looking statements contained in this press release relate, among other matters, to the business outlook of Apollo Group, Inc.
     Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may cause actual results, performance, or achievements of Apollo Group, Inc. to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect Apollo Group, Inc.'s results and cause them to materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation:

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company used non-GAAP measures of pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share, which are adjusted from our GAAP results as shown above. These non-GAAP adjustments are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain charges and other amounts that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. These non-GAAP measures are included to provide investors and management with an alternative method for assessing the Company's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the Company's ongoing operations and to provide a more consistent basis for comparison between quarters. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from pro forma measures used by other companies. The difference between the GAAP amounts and the pro forma amounts is the result of the following special items recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2004:
 The conversion of University of Phoenix Online common stock on August 27, 2004 required us to adjust GAAP income by the premium paid to convert outstanding shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock to Apollo Education Group Class A common stock and to record a stock-based compensation charge related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options.
Stock dividends paid and stock-based compensation
 
As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share," we reduced net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by approximately $114 million related to the non-cash 10% premium paid to redeem the University of Phoenix Online common stock. The amount of the reduction to net income attributable to Apollo Education Group common stock was calculated based on the number of shares of University of Phoenix Online common stock outstanding and converted on August 27, 2004. This non-cash premium is included on the Consolidated Statement of Operations as stock dividends paid.
As required by Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-23 "Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44," we expect to recognize approximately $145 million of non-cash pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to the conversion of University of Phoenix Online stock options into Apollo Education Group Class A stock options. We recognized approximately $124 million of the pre-tax stock-based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and $20 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and will recognize the remaining $2 million as the options vest in 2006 and 2007.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we accrued $9.8 million related to the resolution of a United States Department of Education program review.
