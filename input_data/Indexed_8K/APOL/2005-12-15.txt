Exhibit 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, December 15, 2005  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) today reported fiscal 2006 financial results for the first quarter ended November 30, 2005.
     Net income attributed to Apollo Education Group common stock for the three months ended November 30, 2005, was $130.8 million, or $.73 per diluted share, compared to $109.5 million, or $.58 per diluted share reported for the same period last year.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group, Inc. for the three months ended November 30, 2005, rose 17.6% to $628.9 million, compared with $534.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The University of Phoenix accounted for 84.7% of the $582.1 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the quarter ended November 30, 2005. We believe revenue was impacted approximately $5 million as a result of Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.
     Todd S. Nelson, Chairman and CEO, said, "I am pleased to announce several positive events at Apollo Group that we believe will allow Apollo to become a stronger force in the education industry. Brian Mueller has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Brian has been responsible for the growth and expansion of online education for Apollo over the last decade. In this new role he will be responsible for the consolidation of our online and on-ground marketing and enrollment efforts. We believe that over time this will reduce our marketing expenditures on a per student basis, improve conversion rates and retention, and reduce potential confusion in the marketplace."
     Mr. Nelson continued, "We are pleased to announce that the University of Phoenix board of directors and the Western International University board of directors have approved the transfer of Axia College from Western International University to University of Phoenix. As a part of University of Phoenix, we believe Axia College will be strengthened by the brand recognition of University of Phoenix and the stronger regulatory and academic infrastructure of University of Phoenix. It will take several months to accomplish the regulatory and personnel changes necessary to ensure a smooth transition. To accommodate the possible impact of the transition we are reducing revenue guidance for the year by 4%. We believe the impact on diluted earnings per share will range from no impact to a reduction of 2% (new guidance for the year will now be a range of $2.91 -$2.85) for the year. This adjustment will allow us the flexibility to accomplish the transition in a way that will best ensure the long-term success of this change."
     In addition, Mr. Nelson commented, "We are pleased to announce the board of directors authorized a program allocating an additional $300 million in company funds to repurchase shares of Apollo Education Group Class A common stock."
 
     Consolidated degree enrollments for University of Phoenix and Western International University's Axia College at November 30, 2005, increased by 19.4% to 286,800 students compared to 240,200 students at November 30, 2004. Consolidated degree enrollments of online students increased in excess of 30%. Consolidated degree enrollments for our Other Schools segment (excluding Western International University's Axia College) at November 30, 2005, increased by 3.4% to 28,600 students compared to 27,600 students at November 30, 2004. We believe consolidated degree enrollments were impacted by approximately 3,000 students as a result of Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma.
