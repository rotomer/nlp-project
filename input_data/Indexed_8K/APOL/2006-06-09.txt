Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOL) comments on a recent report that was issued by Lehman Brothers, which questioned whether Apollo Group might have backdated four stock option grants during fiscal 20002004. In response to the report, and as part of its normal Corporate Governance practices, the Company performed a review of its stock option practices, including reviewing documents and interviewing employees. Based upon this review, the Companys initial conclusions are as follows:  The grants included a large number of employees and not just senior executives.  Management believes that it has complied with all applicable laws, including the accelerated Form 4 filing requirements mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, in granting options to officers and it has not backdated options. Apollo Groups Board of Directors plans to hire an outside firm to review and confirm these conclusions.
