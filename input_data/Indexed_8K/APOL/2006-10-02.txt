Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Apollo Group, Inc. announced today that the University of Phoenix reached an agreement with the Florida Commission for Independent Education, indicating that the conditions for Annual License have been met. The University's administrative challenge has been withdrawn, and the Commission has issued an unencumbered (no conditions) Annual License to the University of Phoenix. This resolves the action in late June by the Florida Commission of placing the University on provisional licensure, which was administratively challenged by the University in early July.
