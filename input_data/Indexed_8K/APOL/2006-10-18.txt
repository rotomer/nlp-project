Review of Historic Stock Option Grants
      On June 23, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors appointed a special committee of two independent members of the Board of Directors to oversee the previously announced review of the Company's practices related to stock option grants. The special committee has retained independent legal counsel who engaged outside accounting advisors to assist with the review. The review is ongoing, however, various deficiencies in the process of granting and documenting stock options have been identified to date. The accounting impact of these matters has not been quantified. There can be no assurances that the results of the investigation will not require a possible restatement of the Company's financial statements when the potential errors are quantified and assessed. The attached unaudited financial statements do not include the impact of any unrecorded non-cash equity-based compensation charges that may be required at the conclusion of the review.
      We have not filed our May 31, 2006, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q because the special committee has not completed its work. We plan to file our May 31, 2006, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K as soon as practicable.
