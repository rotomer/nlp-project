Item 8.01 Other Events.
(a) During a conference call held by Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") on Friday, November 3, 2006, the Company responded to certain questions related to the investigation being conducted by the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors concerning options practices at the Company. To date, the Special Committee has found no direct evidence that the grant date for any of the large management grants was selected with the benefit of hindsight. In two instances, though, the price on the grant date is at a relative low point for the Companys stock, and there is little contemporaneous evidence to establish that the grant was made on the grant date. While there is a possibility that the grant date was retroactively selected, there is insufficient evidence at this time to reach such a conclusion. The investigation is ongoing. The Company hopes to complete the investigation and any needed accounting corrections by the end of the year, so that Q1 2007 financials can be issued on a normal ba sis. There is no assurance, however, that this schedule will be accomplished. To the extent that other accounting issues were identified in that investigation, the Company refers investors to its Form 8-K filed on November 3, 2006.
