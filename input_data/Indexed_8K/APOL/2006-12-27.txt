Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On December 14, 2006, as previously reported, Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") notified the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") that the Company would be unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended May 31, 2006, its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, and all required restatements, by the December 29, 2006 deadline set forth in the Panels September 20, 2006 decision letter. The Company requested that the Panel grant a reasonable extension to file those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission such that it will regain compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Markets filing requirements. On December 20, 2006, the Company received a letter from the Panel denying the Companys extension request. Because the Company has not complied with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), the Panel indicated that it had determined to delist and suspend trading of t he Companys securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market effective at the open of business on December 29, 2006 (the "Delisting Decision"). On December 21, 2006, the Company appealed the Panels Delisting Decision, as contemplated by Marketplace Rule 4807(a), and requested that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearings Review Council (the "Listing Council") review it. On December 22, 2006, the Company was informed by the Listing Council that it had determined to call the Panels Delisting Decision for review, as contemplated by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4807(b), and had also stayed the delisting of the Company's securities pending further review by the Listing Council. No date has been set for the review. The Company may submit in writing additional information for the Listing Council's consideration by February 2, 2007. The Company is diligently working on the restatement of its financial statements following receipt by the Board of Directors, on December 8, 2006, of the Specia l Committees final factual findings of its stock option investigation. At this time, the Company is unable to predict when such restatement will be completed. In addition, the Company expects that it will be unable to file its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended November 30, 2006 by the deadline for this report since certain information included in such financial statements is dependent upon finalizing the restated financial statements.

The Listing Council's decision stays a December 20, 2006, determination by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel ("the Panel") to delist and suspend trading of the Company's securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") effective December 29, 2006. The Panel had previously granted the Company's continued listing on Nasdaq provided that it meet a December 29, 2006 deadline to file its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2006 and its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, as well as all required restatements. The Company had informed Nasdaq that it would be unable to meet the December 29, 2006 deadline and had requested that the Panel extend the time period to file the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission
such that it will regain compliance with Nasdaq's filing requirements
. On December 20, 2006, the Company received a letter denying the extension request. The Company appealed to the Listing Council on December 21, 2006.
