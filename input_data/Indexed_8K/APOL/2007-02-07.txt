Results of Operations
     Net income attributed to Apollo Group common stock for the three months ended November 30, 2006, was $115.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share on 174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to $130.8 million, or $0.73 per diluted share on 180.3 million weighted average shares outstanding for the same period last year.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 were $668.2 million, a 6.3% increase over the first quarter 2006, and total student growth was 8.6% versus a year ago. The University of Phoenix, Inc. ("UOP") accounted for 91.2% of the $619.8 million in net tuition revenues from students enrolled in degree programs for the quarter ended November 30, 2006.
     Instructional costs and services increased by $35.3 million in the three months ended November 30, 2006, from the three months ended November 30, 2005 primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers and increases in bad debt expense.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $26.9 million in the three months ended November 30, 2006, from the three months ended November 30, 2005 primarily resulting from increases in the number of enrollment counselors and a significant increase in advertising expenditures.
     General and administrative expenses increased by $4.2 million in the three months ended November 30, 2006, from the three months ended November 30, 2005 primarily due to higher professional fees associated
 
with our stock option investigation and increased employee compensation costs for information technology (IT) projects.
     Commenting on the quarter, Brian Mueller, President, said, "We are pleased with our first quarter as we've made meaningful progress in our operating results as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. When I took over as President in January of 2006, we laid out a clear turnaround plan and we have been executing well against that plan. The first quarter was further validation that our strategy is working and we are making operational improvements. We have a strong and stable management team that has never worked better as a unit and a lot of hard-working students and staff who are very committed to our goals. Apollo Group and UOP have received many awards historically for innovative practices in higher education, and over the last year we began making the necessary strategic investments to build on this innovation. We're confident that this will result in sustainable growth over the long term."
