Exhibit 99.1
     Phoenix, Arizona, May 21, 2007  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or the "Company") today reported fiscal 2007 financial results for its second quarter ended February 28, 2007. In addition, the Company announced that it will be filing later today with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2006, as well as its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended May 31, 2006, November 30, 2006 and February 28, 2007. With these filings, the Company will be current with the SEC on all required and delinquent periodic filings.
     These filings contain financial statements that were restated as a result of Apollo Group's investigation into its past stock option practices, as well as other items. On June 23, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a Special Committee to retain independent legal counsel, who in turn retained forensic accountants, to assist them in conducting an independent review of the Company's historical practices related to stock option grants. On December 16, 2006, the Special Committee's final factual findings were announced in a press release. In November 2006, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, the Company began its own in-depth internal review to ascertain the most likely measurement date of every stock option grant since its initial public offering ("IPO"). As a result of the restatement, for the fiscal years 1994 through 2005, the Company has recorded pre-tax non-cash compensation expense of $52.9 million.
     As previously announced, the Company's continued listing on Nasdaq is subject to review by the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council. The Company believes, based upon the filings that will be made later today with the SEC and additional information previously submitted to the Listing Council, that it will regain compliance with the requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq.
     "From a governance standpoint, Apollo is now a much stronger company, and we are confident in our procedures going forward," said Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, Inc. "We have significantly strengthened the governance and internal controls of the Company, including the implementation of a new process for granting stock options, the addition of two new independent members of the Board of Directors, a new Chairperson of the Audit Committee, and a new Compensation Committee. With the investigation and restatement behind us, our energies are solely focused on creating long-term shareholder value."
     Based on the independent review conducted by the Special Committee as well as Apollo Group's internal review, the Company determined that 57 of the 100 total grants made during the period from 1994 through September 2006 used incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes. The Special Committee also found no direct evidence that the grant date for any of the large management grants was selected with the benefit of hindsight.
     The Company also identified four material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting, which it believes it has made significant progress in remediating as of February 28, 2007. The material weaknesses related to ineffective internal control over financial reporting include:

     The Company had four primary adjustments to its financial statements:
     The financial impact of the adjustments for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of 2007 is summarized in the table below.
     
Second Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income was $60.3 million, or $0.35 per diluted share (174.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $79.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share (175.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Before giving effect to share based compensation expense and other unusual pre-tax charges of $5.7 million and $26.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, earnings per diluted share were $0.44 in the second quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.57 in the second quarter of 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
     Consolidated revenues for the three months ended February 28, 2007, totaled $608.7 million, which represents a 6.7% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Total degreed enrollments grew by 10.2%. The University of Phoenix, Inc. ("UPX") accounted for 92.9% of total tuition and other revenues, net.

     Commenting on the quarter, Mueller said, "We are pleased with the progress we have made in enrollment growth which is driven by productivity improvements in advertising, new enrollment hires, enhanced retention strategies and our branding campaign. New Degreed Enrollments, which we are reporting for the first time, increased 24% year-over-year. The increase in enrollment growth drove revenue growth as well, despite the continued impact of the mix shift to our lower priced Axia program, as well as additional holiday breaks in 2007 versus 2006. In May, we instituted a price increase at Axia which should further benefit revenue growth going forward."
     Mueller continued, "We have refined, with the support of our Board of Directors, a long-term strategic plan to best ensure the effective deployment of our resources and capital. Our goal over time is to generate mid-to-high single-digit annual domestic revenue growth and low double-digit annual operation income and free-cash flow growth."
     Instructional costs and services increased by $33.8 million to $296.4 million, a 12.9% increase, in the three months ended February 28, 2007, as compared to the three months ended February 28, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers, and wage adjustments instituted in December 2005 that increased pay principally to entry-level employees.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $42.7 million to $166.9 million, a 34.4% increase, in the three months ended February 28, 2007, from the three months ended February 28, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in the number of enrollment counselors and an increase in advertising expenditures for both the Company's internet-based advertising campaign as well as the launch of a national televised branding campaign.
     General and administrative expenses decreased by $5.4 million to $53.6 million, a 9.2% decline, in the three months ended February 28, 2007, from the three months ended February 28, 2006. Before giving effect to stock option modifications of $12.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, as well as the unusual charges discussed above of $5.7 million and $26.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, general and administrative expenses were $35.8 million and $33.0 million in the three months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which represents approximately 5.9% of revenues in both periods.
     
Six Months of Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income attributed to Apollo Group common stock was $174.2 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $207.7 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, (178.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
     Total consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2007 were $1.3 billion, a 6.4% increase over the six months of fiscal 2006. Average quarterly degree enrollments grew by 9.3%. UPX accounted for 91.9% of total tuition and other revenues, net.
