     Phoenix, Arizona, June 28, 2007  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or the "Company") today reported fiscal 2007 financial results for the third quarter ended May 31, 2007. The Company also announced that its Board of Directors ("Board") authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of Apollo Group Class A common stock. Under the program the Company may repurchase shares from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Apollo Group management will determine the timing and number of shares repurchased.
            Net income was $131.4 million, or $0.75 per diluted share (174.6 million weighted average shares outstanding), compared to $131.5 million, or $0.75 per diluted share (174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding) for three months ended May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Before giving effect to share based compensation expense and special items of $16.5 million in the third quarter of 2007 and $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2006, earnings per fully diluted share were $0.81 in the third quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.78 in the third quarter 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Third Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Consolidated revenues for the three months ended May 31, 2007, totaled $733.4 million, which represents a 12.2% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Total degreed enrollments grew by 12.2% year-over-year to 311,100.
     Commenting on the quarter, Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, Inc., said, "Our fiscal third quarter is showing promising signs that the investments we made over the last 18 months are paying off. We are very pleased with the improvement we are seeing in enrollment and revenue growth, as well as in our operating margin. The continued progress is driven by further productivity improvements from new enrollment hires, enhanced retention strategies, efficiencies in our advertising spend and our branding campaign. New Degreed Enrollments increased 21.2% year-over-year. We are proud to have achieved double-digit revenue growth due to our strong enrollments and continued improvement in retention. As a reminder, over the long-term, we remain committed to our goal of mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit annual operating income and free cash flow growth."
     Mueller continued, "Our liquidity and cash flow for the quarter were strong. As a result of this and other value considerations, we have increased the size of our existing share repurchase program to up to $500 million."
     Instructional costs and services increased 13.1% or $37.3 million to $321.0 million, in the three months ended May 31, 2007, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers as well as an increase in bad debt expense which, as discussed last quarter, is primarily the result of a shift in the Company's student mix. As a percentage
1
 
of revenue instructional costs and services were 43.8% versus 43.4% a year ago.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $24.7 million to $162.9 million, a 17.9% increase, in the three months ended May 31, 2007, from the three months ended May 31, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in the number of enrollment counselors and an increase in advertising expenditures for both the Company's internet-based advertising campaign as well as the launch of a national televised branding campaign. As a percentage of revenue, selling and promotional expenses were 22.2% versus 21.1% a year ago.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $15.7 million to $46.1 million, a 51.6% increase, in the three months ended May 31, 2007, from the three months ended May 31, 2006. As a percentage of revenues, G&A was 6.3% as compared to 4.7% in the prior year quarter. Before giving effect to special items primarily related to stock option investigation and restatement costs of $7.6 million, G&A expenses were $38.5 million in the three months ended May 31, 2007, or 5.2% of revenues.
            Apollo Group reported the following financial data and operating metrics for the three months ended May 31, 2007 and 2006.
