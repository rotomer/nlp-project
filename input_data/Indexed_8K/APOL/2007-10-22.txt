Apollo Group, Inc. News Release
     Phoenix, Arizona, October 22, 2007  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or the "Company") today reported fiscal 2007 unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended August 31, 2007.
     
Unaudited Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income for the three months ended August 31, 2007 was $103.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share (171.3 million weighted average shares outstanding), compared to $75.7 million, or $0.43 per diluted share (174.5 million weighted average shares outstanding) for three months ended August 31, 2006. Before giving effect to share-based compensation expense and special items of $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $31.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, earnings per diluted share were $0.67 in the fourth quarter of 2007, as compared to $0.54 in the fourth quarter 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.) During the 2007 fourth fiscal quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 7 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of approximately $61 for a total expenditure of $438 million. The repurchases are part of the $500 million authorization for the Company's stock repurchase program approved by the Apollo Group board of directors in June 2007. On October 5, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $500 million in share repurchases.
     Consolidated revenues for the three months ended August 31, 2007, totaled $713.9 million, which represents a 14.2% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Total degreed enrollments grew by 11.1% year-over-year to 313,700.
     Commenting on fiscal 2007, Brian Mueller, president of Apollo Group, Inc., said, "This was a rewarding year for Apollo Group and its stakeholders. We began seeing the benefits of the significant investments we made over the last couple of years and are very pleased with the progress we made both in our operations as well as from a corporate perspective. During the fiscal year we strengthened our management team, particularly in the finance and legal areas, and added additional talent and expertise to our board of directors. We also fortified our financial controls and corporate governance, and as a result, Apollo Group is a stronger company today."
     Mr. Mueller continued, "We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we again achieved double-digit revenue and enrollment growth, while continuing to produce significant cash flow and earnings growth. We have made productivity gains in our enrollment counselor effectiveness, advertising, student persistence, academic excellence and program expansion. As a result, we ended the fiscal year with approximately 313,700 students enrolled in our degree programs. During the fourth quarter alone we started a record 69,800 students."

     Mueller added, "We enter fiscal 2008 with positive momentum and will continue to execute against our strategic plan to best position Apollo Group for long-term sustainable growth."
     Instructional costs and services in the three months ended August 31, 2007, increased by $27.0 million to $327.2 million, a 9.0% increase, from $300.2 million in the three months ended August 31, 2006, primarily resulting from increases in employee-related expenses due to the higher enrollment numbers as well as an increase in bad debt expense. As a percentage of revenue instructional costs and services declined to 45.8% versus 48.0% a year ago.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased by $19.5 million to $173.8 million, a 12.6% increase in the three months ended August 31, 2007, from the three months ended August 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter, the Company experienced a slight decrease in its cost per New Degreed Enrollment (or Starts) which is calculated by dividing total selling and promotional expenses by the amount of new Starts for the quarter. This slight decrease is attributed to improved conversion rates and a lower advertising expense per Start, which was partially offset by higher enrollment counselor costs per Start.
     General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $28.1 million to $62.3 million, an 82.2% increase, in the three months ended August 31, 2007, from the three months ended August 31, 2006. As a percentage of revenues, G&A was 8.7% as compared to 5.5% in the prior year quarter. Before giving effect to special items primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $6.4 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2006, G&A expenses were $55.9 million in the three months ended August 31, 2007, or 7.8% of revenues, compared to $32.6 million in the three months ended August 31, 2006, or 5.2% of revenues. The remaining increase is primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation expense and increased employee headcount to support the Company's future growth.
     
Financial and Operating Metrics (unaudited)
     Apollo Group reported the following unaudited financial data and operating metrics on a quarterly basis for the last eight quarters.
     Included in the table below is a correction of Apollo Group's historical New Degreed Enrollments to adjust for errors and inconsistencies in the calculation with our previously reported definition, which has not changed. To reiterate and clarify, New Degreed Enrollments include any student who graduated from one degree program and started a new degree program (for example, a graduate of the Associates Degree program returns for a Bachelors Degree or a graduate of a Bachelors Degree program returns for a Masters Degree), as well as students who have been out of attendance for greater than 12 months and return to a program. Degreed Enrollments were not affected by this correction since a student completing one program and entering a new program is only counted as one enrollment (in the new program) and returning students out of attendance for greater than 12 months were already included in degreed enrollments.

Unaudited Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations
     Net income for the twelve months ended August 31, 2007 was $408.8 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, (173.6 million weighted average shares outstanding), compared to $414.8 million, or $2.35 per diluted share, (176.2 million weighted average shares outstanding) for the twelve months ended August 31, 2006. Before giving effect to share-based compensation expense and special items of $75.7 million in fiscal 2007 and $75.5 million in fiscal 2006, earnings per diluted share were $2.62 in fiscal 2007, as compared to $2.61 in fiscal 2006. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial

information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
     Consolidated revenues for Apollo Group for the twelve months ended August 31, 2007 were $2.7 billion, a 9.9% increase over the twelve months of fiscal 2006. Average quarterly degree enrollments grew by 10.5%.
     Instructional costs and services as a percentage of tuition and other net revenues increased in 2007 versus 2006 due primarily to an increase in bad debt expense and higher employee compensation and related expenses. Bad debt expense increased as a result of higher days sales outstanding ("DSOs"), longer receivable collection periods, and higher write-offs primarily from the Company's associate's degree program students. Employee compensation and related expenses increased primarily to support the 10.5% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments.
     Selling and promotional expenses increased as a percentage of revenue in 2007 versus 2006 due primarily to an increase in the number of enrollment counselors to support leads for the Company's Internet advertising campaign. During 2007, the Company experienced a slight increase in its cost per New Degreed Enrollment (or Starts) which is calculated by dividing total selling and promotional expenses by the amount of new Starts for the year. The hiring of an additional 600 enrollment counselors in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased the Company's enrollment counselor compensation and related expenses. The productivity of these counselors improved during 2007, and as a result, the Company has experienced increased conversion rates. Also, in 2007 selling and promotional expenses increased as a result of the Company's continued investment in Internet-based advertising campaigns and the launch of a nationally televised branding campaign.
     General and administrative expenses increased by 31.7% in 2007 versus 2006. Excluding special items, primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs, general and administrative expense was $167.7 million and $125.4 million in 2007 and 2006, or 6.2% and 5.1% of revenue, respectively. The remaining increase in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily related to higher employee headcount to support the Company's growth and higher share-based compensation expense.
     
Unaudited Balance Sheet
     As of August 31, 2007, the Company's cash and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, was $392.7 million as compared to $408.7 million as of August 31, 2006. DSOs increased from 31 days at August 31, 2006 to 38 days as of August 31, 2007. Deferred tuition revenue increased 22.7% to $167.3 million between August 31, 2007 and 2006.
