Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On January 4, 2008, Apollo Group, Inc. entered into a five-year $500 million credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and various lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million revolving credit commitment, which may be used (i) for revolving loans, (ii) for swingline advances, subject to a sublimit of $25 million, and (iii) to request the issuance of letters of credit on our behalf, subject to a sublimit of $200 million. We may, subject to customary conditions, increase the commitments by up to an additional $250 million, subject to, among other things, the receipt of commitments for the increased amounts. The Credit Agreement also provides for a multi-currency sublimit facility for borrowings in certain specified currencies up to $300 million. The facility is unsecured and guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries.
The revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at rates that, at our option, can be either: (a) a base rate (the "ABR") equal to the higher of (i) the administrative agent's prime rate, and (ii) the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus 0.5%, or (b) reserve and cost adjusted LIBO rate plus an applicable rate specified in the Credit Agreement. The applicable rate ranges from 0.50% to 0.825% based primarily on our leverage ratio. All swingline loans bear interest at the ABR.
We are also required to pay a facility fee on the average daily amount of the aggregate commitment available under the Credit Agreement (whether used or unused) that ranges from 0.125% to 0.175% per annum, a letter of credit participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the then applicable rate (based on our leverage ratio) on the average daily undrawn dollar amount of each letter of credit plus the amount of unreimbursed draws under such letter of credit, and a letter of credit fronting fee equal to 0.125% of the average daily undrawn dollar amount of each letter of credit plus the amount of unreimbursed draws under such letter of credit, as well as customary administrative and other charges.
The credit facility contains various customary representations, covenants and other provisions. In addition, we are required to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA of 2.5 or less and a minimum coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDAR (EDITDA plus rent expense) to consolidated interest expense plus rent expense of at least 1.75. Further, we are required to maintain a minimum DOE ratio of 1.5. The DOE ratio is a consolidated composite score determined by the Secretary of the Department of Education pursuant to regulations under Title IV.
Certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement or their affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, certain commercial, banking, financial advisory, and investment banking services in the ordinary course of business for us and our subsidiaries, for which they receive customary fees and commissions.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, January 8, 2008  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group" or "the Company") today reported unaudited financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, which ended November 30, 2007.
Net income for the three months ended November 30, 2007, was $139.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted share (169.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $113.9 million, or $0.65 per diluted share (174.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended November 30, 2006. Before giving effect to share-based compensation expense of $14.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and to share-based compensation expense and special items of $12.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, earnings per diluted share were $0.88 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as compared to $0.69 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. (See the reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited First Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Results of Operations
Consolidated revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2007, totaled $780.7 million, which represents a 16.9% increase over the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Total Degreed Enrollment grew by 11.4% year-over-year to 325,000. Revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 also benefited from previously implemented selective tuition price increases based on geographic areas and programs.
Commenting on the quarter, Brian Mueller, President of Apollo Group, said, "We are pleased with our first quarter results as we achieved double-digit revenue and enrollment growth for the third consecutive quarter. Our investments in the business are proving very effective and we again improved operating efficiencies as compared to a year ago."
Mr. Mueller continued, "At the end of October we closed our acquisition of Aptimus, and our marketing teams have been working tirelessly over the past couple of months to transition our online marketing activities in-house. We are pleased to report that the transition is going smoothly. Over the next several months and quarters, we will be implementing innovative marketing plans to moreeffectively communicate with prospective students and other constituents online."

Mr. Mueller concluded, "The demographic and economic trends contributing to the rise of adult education over the past three decades continue, and the emerging global marketplace expands the opportunities even more. Apollo Global, our recently formed joint venture with the Carlyle Group, will enable us to leverage our significant academic and operational infrastructure related to higher education and we look forward to capitalizing on the opportunities that exist given the significant foreign demand for education. We are optimistic about the future for Apollo Group and the credit agreement announced today gives us further financial flexibility to execute on our strategy to generate long-term value for our shareholders."
Instructional costs and services increased by $38.5 million to $333.3 million, a 13.1% increase, for the three months ended November 30, 2007, from the three months ended November 30, 2006. As a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, instructional costs and services declined to 42.7% versus 44.1% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of decreases as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in employee compensation and related expenses and classroom lease expenses and depreciation. This decrease was partially offset by increases as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in bad debt expense and financial aid processing costs.
Bad debt expense as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 versus the first quarter of fiscal 2007 primarily due to the continuing trend of changes in the Company's enrollment mix to a higher percentage of associate's degree students. When the Company is required to collect outstanding balances directly from its students, students enrolled in the associate's degree programs generally have higher write-offs, based on the greater risk of default presented by the associate's degree program's demographics, versus students enrolled in other degree programs. Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company performed a review of the components of bad debt expense and identified certain items that should have been classified as discounts or refunds (reduction of tuition revenue) as opposed to bad debt expense. No reclassification was made for prior periods as the amounts were not material to prior period financial statements and had no effect on reported net income. Had the Company not changed the classification for these items in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the amounts reported for tuition and other revenue, net, and bad debt expense would have been $5.1 million higher, and bad debt expense as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, would have been 4.78% versus 4.15%. For the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, the Company's reported bad debt expense as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, would have been lower by 59, 82, 65 and 87 basis points, respectively, as a result of this reclassification.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $21.5 million to $176.9 million, a 13.8% increase, for the three months ended November 30, 2007, from the three months ended November 30, 2006. As a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, selling and promotional expenses declined to 22.6% versus 23.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of a decrease as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in Internet-based advertising costs, partially offset by an increase as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in costs to support the Company's national branding campaign. The Company's reduced advertising costs

as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, are being primarily driven by more efficient and productive spending to acquire higher quality Internet-based leads. As previously disclosed, the Company launched its national branding campaign in January 2007 and continues to invest to support its image.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $13.7 million to $51.3 million, a 36.4% increase, for the three months ended November 30, 2007, from the three months ended November 30, 2006. As a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, G&A increased to 6.6% versus 5.6% in the prior year quarter. Before giving effect to special items primarily related to the stock option investigation and restatement costs of $2.0 million in first quarter of fiscal 2007, G&A expenses were $35.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2006, or 5.3% of tuition and other revenue, net. The increase in G&A as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 is primarily attributable to increases as a percentage of tuition and other revenue, net, in salary and related payroll costs due to higher employee headcount, share-based compensation expense and legal costs.

As of November 30, 2007, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $590.5 million as compared to $392.7 million as of August 31, 2007. At November 30, 2007, days sales outstanding ("DSO") remained consistent with the prior year at 35 days and declined from 38 days at August 31, 2007. The decrease in DSO since August 31, 2007, is primarily due to a reduction in the percentage of current (less than 90 days old) receivables as a result of improvements in the Company's front-end collection process. The reclassification of bad debt expense discussed above did not affect the Company's DSO. Deferred revenue at November 30, 2007, decreased slightly to $160.0 million from $167.3 million at August 31, 2007, and increased from $132.0 million at November 30, 2006. The increase from the prior year quarter is principally due to increased revenue.
