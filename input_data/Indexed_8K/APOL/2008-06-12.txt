Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Apollo Group, Inc. announced tuition increases for its University of Phoenix students which will go into effect for courses beginning on or after July 1, 2008. The increases are designed to enable the University of Phoenix to maintain its high degree of academic excellence. The tuition increases will include an increase of approximately 10% for its associate programs and other selective tuition increases averaging 4% to 5%, depending on geographic area and program, for bachelor and masters degree programs. There is currently no planned tuition increase for doctoral programs. The impact of these price changes on future revenue and operating income will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, changes in enrollment, changes in student mix within programs and degree levels, and discounts. Apollo Group will discuss these price changes in its previously announced third quarter earnings conference call on July 1, 2008.
