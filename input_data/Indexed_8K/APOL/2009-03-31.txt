Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, March 31, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2009.
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2009, totaled $876.1 million, which represents a 26.3% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to the growth was a 20.4% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 397,700. The Company reported net income for the three months ended February 28, 2009, of $125.3 million, or $0.77 per share (162.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to a net loss of $32.0 million, or $0.19 per share (168.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 29, 2008. Included in the fiscal 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $168.4 million which represented an accrual for estimated damages stemming from an adverse jury verdict in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, when the trial court vacated the judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $70.3 million or $0.41 per share (170.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
"We are pleased with the growth in revenue and enrollments in our second quarter and we believe we are continuing to benefit from investments we are making in key academic and operational areas," said Chas Edelstein, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group. "University of Phoenix again contributed significantly to our results, driven by 20% Degreed Enrollment growth, bringing the total during the quarter to nearly 400,000 students. This growth would not be possible without the incredible commitment of our faculty and staff who work tirelessly to provide a high level of academic quality in the classroom and outstanding support to our students."
Instructional costs and services increased by $45.6 million, or 13.9% to $373.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2009, from $327.7 million in the three months ended February 29, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 460 basis

points to 42.6% versus 47.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement was predominantly due to University of Phoenix continuing to leverage its fixed costs, such as certain employee wages, classroom space and depreciation expense. This was partially offset by greater expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, at Apollo Global and Insight Schools associated with their start-up and development and other infrastructure and support costs. University of Phoenix benefited from economies of scale associated with its 26.0% increase in net revenue due to certain costs being relatively fixed including certain wages, classroom space and depreciation. Additionally, University of Phoenix has grown its variable headcount at a slower rate than the increase in net revenue. The Company also benefited from savings due to lower negotiated contract costs in financial aid processing. These gains were offset somewhat by a 30 basis point increase, as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense versus the second quarter of fiscal 2008. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2009, bad debt expense increased 50 basis points, as a percentage of net revenue. The increases are primarily due to the increased risk of collecting aged receivables and lower collection rates on those receivables given the current economic downturn.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $24.0 million, or 11.9%, to $225.7 million for the three months ended February 28, 2009, from $201.7 million in the three months ended February 29, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 330 basis points to 25.8%, from 29.1% in the prior year's second quarter. This was mainly a result of improvement at University of Phoenix where enrollment counselor effectiveness continues to improve due, in part, to increased tenure of enrollment counselors. Additionally, investments in marketing resulted in more effective and efficient advertising at University of Phoenix. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2009, increased by $16.1 million, or 29.3%, to $71.1 million, from $55.0 million in the three months ended February 29, 2008. G&A, as a percentage of net revenue, increased to 8.1% in the second quarter of 2009, versus 7.9% in the comparable period a year ago. The 20 basis point increase is mainly attributable to expenses related to the Company's self-reporting of a Title IV Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) compliance matter.

Unaudited Six Months of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the six months ended February 28, 2009, was $1.8 billion, a 25.3% increase over comparable period of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this increase was a 19.4% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the six months ended February 28, 2009 as compared to the six months ended February 29, 2008.
The Company reported net income of $305.7 million, or $1.89 per share, (161.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $107.8 million, or $0.63 per share, (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2009, and February 29, 2008, respectively. Included in the fiscal 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $168.4 million which represented an accrual for estimated damages stemming from an adverse jury verdict in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, when the trial court vacated the earlier judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $210.1 million, or $1.24 per share (169.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for the six months of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 28, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $908.8 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $114.2 million and $108.2 million since August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At February 28, 2009, accounts receivable declined to $194.0 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") declined to 25 days at February 28, 2009 as compared to 30 days at February 29, 2008, and 29 days at August 31, 2008. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid as well as increased net revenue.
Total deferred revenue at February 28, 2009, increased to $247.5 million from $231.2 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is seasonal in nature and consistent with the Company's enrollment growth.
