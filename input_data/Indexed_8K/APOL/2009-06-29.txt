Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, June 29, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or "the Company") today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2009.
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended May 31, 2009, totaled $1,051.3 million, which represents a 25.9% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to the growth was a 21.8% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 420,700. The Company reported net income for the three months ended May 31, 2009, of $201.1 million, or $1.26 per share (159.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $139.1 million, or $0.85 per share (163.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2008.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 7.2 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $61.62 per share for a total expenditure of $444.4 million (of which $38.8 million is included in accrued liabilities for repurchased shares that settled subsequent to May 31, 2009). On June 25, 2009, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $500 million.
Included in the fiscal 2008 third quarter results is a pre-tax charge of $1.6 million associated with the judgment in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 when the trial court vacated the judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $140.1 million, or $0.85 per share (163.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
"We are pleased to report a record third quarter, driven largely by continuing increases in enrollments and improved student retention at University of Phoenix," said Co-Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group, Chas Edelstein. "When our students succeed academically, we succeed financially and, for the first time in a quarter, Apollo surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark."

Co-Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Group and Chairman of Apollo Global, Greg Cappelli, added, "We are also encouraged by the recent advancement of our strategic investments through Apollo Global, best demonstrated by our pending acquisition of the highly regarded BPP Holdings plc in the desirable UK market."
Instructional costs and services increased by $52.6 million, or 15.1% to $400.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009, from $347.6 million in the three months ended May 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 350 basis points to 38.1% versus 41.6% in the prior year's third quarter. The improvement was predominantly due to University of Phoenix continuing to leverage its fixed costs, such as certain wages, classroom space and depreciation expense. University of Phoenix has grown its variable headcount at a slower rate than the increase in net revenue. The Company also benefited from savings due to lower negotiated contract costs in financial aid processing and other areas. This was partially offset by higher expenses, as a percentage of net revenue, at Apollo Global associated with its start-up and development and other infrastructure and support costs, as well as, a 100 basis point increase to 3.4%, as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense versus the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The increases are primarily due to the increased risk of collecting aged receivables and lower collection rates on those receivables given the current economic downturn.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $40.0 million, or 19.6%, to $243.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009, from $203.6 million in the three months ended May 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 120 basis points to 23.2% versus 24.4% in the prior year's third quarter. This was mainly a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix. Additionally, investments in marketing resulted in more effective and efficient advertising at University of Phoenix. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses for the three months ended May 31, 2009, increased by $10.6 million, or 17.4%, to $71.5 million, from $60.9 million in the three months ended May 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses decreased 50 basis points to 6.8% versus 7.3% in the prior year's third quarter. The improvement is mainly attributable to the continued leverage of relatively fixed employee compensation costs for executive management, finance and IT personnel.

Unaudited Nine Months of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2009, was $2.9 billion, a 25.5% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2008. Contributing to this increase was a 20.3% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the nine months ended May 31, 2009, as compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2008. University of Phoenix New Degreed Enrollment during the first nine months of fiscal 2009 increased 23.7% as compared with the first nine months of fiscal 2008.
The Company reported net income of $506.8 million, or $3.15 per share, (161.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $246.9 million, or $1.47 per share, (167.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2009, and May 31, 2008, respectively. Included in the fiscal 2008 results is a pre-tax charge of $170.0 million associated with the judgment in a securities class action lawsuit. This charge was reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 when the trial court vacated the earlier judgment. Before giving effect to the litigation charge, net income was $350.2 million, or $2.09 per share (167.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for the nine months of fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $819.1 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations, partially offset by share repurchases. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $105.5 million and $92.4 million since August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At May 31, 2009, accounts receivable declined to $192.6 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008, primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") declined to 24 days at May 31, 2009, as compared to 26 days at May 31, 2008, and 29 days at August 31, 2008. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to improvements in processing time for the receipt of student financial aid as well as increased net revenue.
Total deferred revenue at May 31, 2009, increased to $261.2 million from $231.2 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is seasonal in nature and consistent with the Company's enrollment growth.
Subsequent to the quarter end, Apollo Global entered into an Implementation Agreement to acquire BPP Holdings plc ("BPP"), a UK-based provider of education and training to professionals in the legal and finance industries. Pursuant to the acquisition arrangement, Apollo Global will acquire all of the outstanding shares of BPP for a cash purchase price of 620 pence

per share, which represents an enterprise value of approximately $540 million based upon the exchange rate on June 5, 2009. In connection with the acquisition, the Company was required to provide assurance that it has the funds to execute the transaction. As a result, the Company provided an intercompany loan to Apollo Global to fund an escrow account with $550 million to be used solely to fund the purchase price in this acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2009.
