Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, October 27, 2009  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2009.
"We are pleased to report another quarter of excellent financial and operating performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "We continue to focus on enhancing the student experience and delivering quality academic programs that are relevant to today's working learner. The combination of these efforts is being recognized in the marketplace and resulted in solid enrollments and continued improvement in the retention of our current students."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "We also continue to execute on our strategy by investing to maximize the value of the University of Phoenix, including a focus on our admissions process to more effectively reach students who retain at higher rates, while expanding intelligently both domestically and globally as evidenced by our acquisition of BPP, which closed during the fourth quarter. We believe that a superior student experience, enabled by our talented and engaged faculty and staff and education-based technology innovations, will result in long-term value for our shareholders."
Unaudited Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2009 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2009, totaled $1,075.8 million, which represents a 29.4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter was a 22.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 443,000. The Company reported net income for the three months ended August 31, 2009, of $91.5 million, or $0.59 per share (155.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to net income of $229.6 million, or $1.43 per share (160.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended August 31, 2008.
The fiscal 2009 fourth quarter results contain special items totaling pre-tax charges of $95.4 million ($69.4 million net of tax), including an accrual for an estimated litigation settlement of $80.5 million, a $9.4 million write-off of information technology fixed assets that resulted primarily from the Company's rationalization of software, a $5.5 million charge, net of minority interest, representing the option premium for a currency hedge in connection with Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP Holdings plc ("BPP") and a discrete charge to the income tax provision of $4.7 million due to the write-off of a deferred tax asset as a result of certain disallowed deductions associated with share-based compensation related to options exercised by
1
 
an executive during the fourth quarter. Included in the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter results is a reversal of a previously-accrued litigation loss associated with a securities matter of $170.0 million when the earlier judgment was vacated, as well as a $9.5 million gain from a third party's forfeiture of an escrow deposit in connection with a now-cancelled agreement to sell and lease back the Company's headquarters buildings.
Excluding these special items, net income for the three months ended August 31, 2009, was $165.6 million, or $1.06 per share, compared to net income of $120.5 million, or $0.75 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, BPP's operations contributed $13.1 million to revenue and reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.03. Apollo Global completed the acquisition of BPP, a UK-based provider of education and training mainly to professionals in the legal and finance industries on July 30, 2009. The final purchase price for BPP was $602 million.
On September 30, 2009, University of Phoenix, a subsidiary of Apollo Group, Inc., confirmed that it has entered into settlement discussions with plaintiffs to resolve the Incentive Compensation False Claims Act litigation pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. There is no assurance that a settlement will be reached. Pending the outcome of these discussions, University of Phoenix and the plaintiffs jointly requested a stay of all litigation proceedings for 45 days, which was granted on October 2, 2009. In connection with this matter, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $80.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 which is the Company's best estimate of the loss to be incurred in connection with this matter, including associated expenses.
Instructional costs and services increased by $90.6 million, or 25.0% to $452.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services declined 150 basis points to 42.1% versus 43.6% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The reduction, as a percentage of revenue, was greater when excluding the impact of BPP's operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement was predominantly due to University of Phoenix continuing to leverage its fixed costs, such as certain wages, classroom space and depreciation expense. University of Phoenix has grown its headcount at a slower rate than the increase in net revenue. The Company also benefited from savings due to lower negotiated contract costs in financial aid processing and other areas. This was partially offset by higher expenses at Apollo Global associated with its start-up, development and other infrastructure and support costs for the Company's international operations, as well as, a 120 basis point increase to 4.2%, as a percentage of net revenue, in bad debt expense versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase in bad debt expense is primarily due to the increased risk of collecting aged receivables and lower collection rates on those receivables given the current economic downturn.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $39.4 million, or 17.6%, to $262.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 240 basis points to 24.4% versus 26.8% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The reduction, as a percentage of
2
 
revenue, was slightly less when excluding the impact of BPP's operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. The improvement was mainly a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix. Additionally, investments in marketing resulted in more effective and efficient advertising. The Company continues to invest in marketing to build greater brand identity as well as to drive and support future enrollment growth.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $41.3 million, or 86.0%, to $89.3 million, for the three months ended August 31, 2009, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses increased 250 basis points to 8.3% versus 5.8% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase is mainly attributable to the $9.4 million fixed asset write-off, discussed previously, and a lesser amount of compensation expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, related to the departure of certain senior executives. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
The Company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was 52.2%. The increase versus a year ago is principally attributable to higher state tax rates; the potential tax impact of the qui tam lawsuit settlement, which may not be fully deductible; and the write-off of the deferred tax assets discussed previously.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 versus the prior year period.

2009 Fiscal Year End Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, was $4.0 billion, a 26.5% increase over fiscal 2008. Contributing to this increase was a 20.8% increase in University of
4
 
Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment for fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008. University of Phoenix's combined New Degreed Enrollment for fiscal 2009 increased 23.5% as compared with fiscal 2008.
The Company reported net income of $598.3 million, or $3.75 per share, (159.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $476.5 million, or $2.87 per share, (165.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the special items described previously, net income for fiscal 2009 was $672.4 million, or $4.22 per share, as compared to net income of $470.7 million, or $2.84 per share for fiscal 2008. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2009, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $987.8 million as compared to $511.5 million as of August 31, 2008. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations as well as borrowings of the entire credit line under the Company's $500 million credit facility, partially offset by share repurchases and funds used in Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP. Restricted cash and student deposits increased by approximately $48.1 million and $78.3 million, respectively, compared to August 31, 2008, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased student enrollment and to increases in Title IV funds available to students.
At August 31, 2009, accounts receivable increased to $298.3 million from $221.9 million at August 31, 2008. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") increased to 32 days at August 31, 2009, as compared to 29 days at August 31, 2008. The increase in DSO is due to both temporary as well as structural changes to the Company's operations. Temporary items include the timing of the billing cycle relative to year-end, and a more pronounced seasonal increase due to the Company's annual student financial aid system enhancements and upgrades, which temporarily postpones the processing of student financial aid requests resulting in a delay of corresponding disbursements of Title IV loan proceeds. Additionally, University of Phoenix has implemented certain operational changes that cause an increase in the Company's accounts receivable balance and DSO calculation.
Goodwill increased by $436.4 million to $522.4 million at August 31, 2009, from $86.0 million at August 31, 2008, and intangible assets, net, increased by $180.6 million to $203.7 million at August 31, 2009, from $23.1 million at August 31, 2008. These increases were primarily due to Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
Total deferred revenue at August 31, 2009, increased to $333.0 million from $231.2 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is principally due to increased student enrollment as well as Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) increased by $558.2 million to $589.1 million at August 31, 2009, from $30.9 million at August 31, 2008. The increase is mainly due to borrowings of the entire credit line under the
5
 
Company's $500 million credit facility, along with debt assumed in the BPP acquisition. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Company has repaid approximately $393 million of its borrowings on its credit facility.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
6
 
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
