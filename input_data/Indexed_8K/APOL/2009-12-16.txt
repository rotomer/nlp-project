Update regarding the False Claims Act lawsuit filed in 2003 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California against Apollo Group, Inc. subsidiary, University of Phoenix, Inc., entitled
United States of America ex rel. Mary Hendow and Julie Albertson v. University of Phoenix
.
     On December 14, 2009, the parties entered into a settlement agreement regarding the above lawsuit, effective December 11, 2009. Also on December 14, the University of Phoenix and the two private plaintiffs filed with the court a joint stipulation of dismissal. The court issued an order on December 15, 2009 requesting that the parties provide additional information about the settlement agreement to allow the court to evaluate whether the allocation of the settlement payment among the parties complies with the False Claims Act. Apollo Group believes that after supplying the requested information to the court, the lawsuit will be dismissed in due course in accordance with the executed settlement agreement.
