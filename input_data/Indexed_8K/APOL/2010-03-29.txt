Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, Arizona, March 29, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2010.
"We are pleased with our second quarter results, particularly with respect to the continued mix shift in student enrollments towards bachelor degree level students," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein. "We have set forth a strategy to transition the University of Phoenix to focus on better identifying and enrolling students who have a reasonable chance to succeed in our rigorous programs, and we are delivering on that plan."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli added, "Through our refined marketing efforts focused on identifying students who are better prepared for our programs, as well as the positive early results we are seeing from our University Orientation pilot, we are beginning to see the shift in student mix that we have been targeting, which we believe over time will result in more consistent, higher quality growth and profitability and will positively impact a number of our key metrics."
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the three months ended February 28, 2010, totaled $1,070.3 million, which represents a 23.1% increase over the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Contributing to the growth in the second quarter was a 15.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 458,600 as well as $53.6 million in revenue from recently acquired BPP Holdings. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2010, of $103.2 million, or $0.67 per share (155.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $128.8 million, or $0.79 per share (162.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2009.
The second quarter of fiscal 2010 results contain a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax), which represents an accrual related to a securities class action lawsuit. Excluding this special item, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2010, was $130.1 million, or $0.84 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $128.8 million, or $0.79 per share for the three months ended February 28, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.) In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, BPP's operations contributed $53.6 million to revenue and due to the seasonality of its business, decreased Apollo Group's diluted earnings per share from
1
 
continuing operations by approximately $0.06. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Excluded from continuing operations are the operating results for Insight Schools, which is now presented as discontinued operations, for all periods presented because the business is not longer consistent with the Company's long-term strategic objectives. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, associated with Insight Schools was $10.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $3.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Included in the $10.6 million loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge of $9.4 million. The Company recorded this charge to reduce the carrying value of Insight Schools based on inputs from advisors which includes consideration of non-binding offers the Company recently received from third parties to purchase Insight Schools.
Instructional costs and services increased by $152.9 million, or 42.0% to $517.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2010, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2009. As a percentage of net revenue, instructional costs and services increased 640 basis points to 48.3% versus 41.9% in the prior year's second quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the addition of BPP, as its cost structure is more heavily weighted towards instructional costs and services, as well as higher bad debt expense for University of Phoenix. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased 280 basis points to 6.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 versus 4.1% in the prior year's second quarter. BPP's operations favorably impacted overall bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The higher bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, is due to lower collection rates. Collection rates have declined as a result of the economic downturn, the effects of certain operational changes and increases in receivables from students enrolled in associate's degree programs. Students enrolled in associate's degree programs generally persist at lower rates than those in bachelor's and graduate level programs, resulting in higher bad debts when these students withdraw.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $38.9 million, or 17.3%, to $263.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2010, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2009. The increase was due in part to greater investments in the University of Phoenix's non-internet long-term branding initiatives. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 120 basis points to 24.6% versus 25.8% in the prior year's second quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, was driven by the impact of BPP's operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as BPP incurs lower selling and promotional costs as a percentage of revenue compared to the Company's other businesses. The remaining decrease as a percentage of revenue was a result of continued improvement in enrollment counselor effectiveness at University of Phoenix.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $2.6 million, or 3.7%, to $72.0 million, for the three months ended February 28, 2010, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2009. As a percentage of net revenue, G&A expenses declined 130 basis points to 6.7% versus 8.0% in the prior year's second quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 resulting from an internal
2
 
review of certain Satisfactory Academic Progress calculations, as well as lower share-based compensation expense, as a percentage of revenue, in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared with the prior year period. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.

Unaudited Six Months of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the six months ended February 28, 2010, was $2.3 billion, a 27.1% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2009. Contributing to this increase was a 16.8% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the six months ended February 28, 2010, as compared to the six months ended February 28, 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $343.7 million, or $2.21 per share, (155.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $311.1 million, or $1.92 per share, (161.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2010, and February 28, 2009, respectively.
Results for the six months ended February 28, 2010, contain a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax), which represents an accrual for a potential settlement of a securities class action lawsuit and a previously announced tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2010, was $359.2 million, or $2.31 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $311.1 million, or $1.92 per share for the six months ended February 28, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
BPP's operations contributed $142.3 million to revenue and decreased earnings per share by approximately $0.02 for the six months ended February 28, 2010. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 28, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $660.8 million as compared to $968.2 million as of August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily attributable to repayments on the Company's outstanding debt and share repurchases, as well as settlement payments of the Company's False Claims Act case and an IRS tax dispute. Restricted cash increased by $74.8 million compared to August 31, 2009, primarily due to increased student deposits at University of Phoenix.
At February 28, 2010, accounts receivable decreased to $261.2 million from $298.3 million at August 31, 2009. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 30 days at February 28, 2010, compared to 32 days at August 31, 2009, and to 25 days at February 28, 2009. The increase in DSO versus a year ago is due to increases in gross accounts receivable due to lower collection rates at University of Phoenix. Collection rates have declined as a result of the economic downturn, the effects of certain operational changes and increases in receivables from students enrolled in associate degree programs.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $413.0 million to $176.1 million at February 28, 2010, from $589.1 million at August 31, 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the repayment of US denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.

Share Repurchase Authorization
On February 18, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million increase of the share repurchase program to an aggregate of $1.0 billion. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $59.61 per share for a total expenditure of $200.0 million. As of February 28, 2010, approximately $800.0 million remained available under the share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
Given the transition it is undertaking in its business, the Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 based on current business trends, which could change:
Based on current business trends, for the fiscal year 2010, the Company should achieve its long-term target of mid-teens operating income growth, excluding the impact of special items and discontinued operations.

These forward-looking statements are based on current information and expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to various factors, including changes in the overall global economy, changes in enrollment or student mix, changes in the collectability of receivables, regulatory and litigation developments and the effectiveness of the Company's integration of its acquired businesses. For a discussion of the various factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, please refer to the risk factors and other disclosures contained in Apollo Group's Form 10-K for fiscal year 2009 and subsequent Forms 10-Q, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the Company's website at apollogrp.edu.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
