Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, October 13, 2010  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2010.
"Fiscal 2010 has been a year of significant progress at Apollo Group, as we have been completing the development of numerous strategic initiatives that are being implemented over the coming year," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "These initiatives, which are designed to enhance the student experience, expand student protections and ensure that we enroll students who we believe, have a greater likelihood to succeed in our programs. These initiatives will present new challenges for the Company in the year ahead, but they are the right things to do for our students and they will better position us to succeed as an organization over the longer term."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We agree with the stated goal of the Department of Education and of Congress to ensure that students in the postsecondary education system receive a quality education at a good value. We have taken and intend to continue to take a leadership role within the proprietary sector by providing students with a good value for their educational investment while employing marketing practices that fully and fairly inform our students about the educational options available to them, as well as the costs and potential benefits of an education."
Unaudited Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2010 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 totaled $1,259.4 million, which represents a 17.4% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Contributing to the growth in the fourth quarter was a 6.3% year-over-year increase in University of Phoenix total Degreed Enrollment to 470,800, as well as an increase of $20.5 million in net revenue from BPP Holdings, which was acquired on July 30, 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2010, of $47.5 million, or $0.32 per share (148.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $97.2 million, or $0.62 per share (155.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended August 31, 2009.
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $175.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($150.5 million net of non-controlling interests) and a $0.9 million charge representing an accrual for incremental post-judgment interest related to a securities class action lawsuit. The
1
 
Company did not record a tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes. The fiscal 2009 fourth quarter results included special items totaling $95.4 million pre-tax, as well as a discrete charge to the income tax provision of $4.7 million. The special items included an accrual for an estimated litigation settlement of $80.5 million, a $9.4 million write-off of information technology fixed assets that resulted primarily from the Company's rationalization of software, and a $5.5 million charge, net of non-controlling interests, representing the option premium for a currency hedge in connection with Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP.
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2010, was $193.9 million, or $1.31 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $171.3 million, or $1.10 per share for the three months ended August 31, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, BPP's operations contributed $33.6 million to net revenue compared with $13.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 following the July 30, 2009, acquisition of BPP. BPP's results diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group by approximately $0.15 excluding the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 ($1.13 including the impairment charges) compared with a decrease of $0.03 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. (See the supplemental schedule detailing BPP's financial results in the tables section of this press release.)
Instructional costs and services increased by $104.0 million, or 23.4% to $547.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, instructional costs and services increased 220 basis points to 43.5% versus 41.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase, as a percentage of revenue, was primarily due to the addition of BPP, as its cost structure is more heavily weighted towards instructional costs and services, as well as higher bad debt expense for University of Phoenix, partially offset by the reversal of a $5.0 million accrual which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, related to a state grant program. Bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased 170 basis points to 5.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 versus 4.2% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The higher bad debt expense, as a percentage of revenue, is a result of the economic downturn and increases in receivables from undergraduate students entering with less than 24 credits. Collection rates for these students are generally lower compared to students with more college experience or those enrolled in graduate level programs.
Selling and promotional expenses increased by $40.9 million, or 15.7%, to $301.6 million for the three months ended August 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, selling and promotional expenses declined 40 basis points to 23.9% versus 24.3% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, was a result of slower hiring of enrollment advisors, partially offset by higher advertising expenditures directed at bachelor degree and graduate degree level programs at University of Phoenix. BPP's operations had little impact on selling and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.

General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 3.1%, to $91.0 million, for the three months ended August 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2009. As a percentage of revenue, G&A expenses declined 100 basis points to 7.2% versus 8.2% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease, as a percentage of revenue, is primarily attributable to a $9.4 million fixed asset write-off noted as a special item in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. BPP's operations had little impact on G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.

2010 Fiscal Year End Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, was $4.9 billion, a 24.6% increase over fiscal 2009. Contributing to this increase was a 13.1% increase in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $568.4 million, or $3.72 per share, (152.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, compared to $614.7 million, or $3.85 per share, (159.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009.
Results for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, contain special items that include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $184.6 million for the BPP and Universidad Latinoamericana ("ULA") subsidiaries of Apollo Global ($158.0 million net of non-controlling interests) and $178.0 million in charges related to a securities class action lawsuit, as well as a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement for disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. The Company did not record a tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charges, as they are not deductible for tax purposes. Results for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009, included special items totaling $95.4 million pre-tax, as well as a discrete charge to the income tax provision of $4.7 million. The special items included an accrual for an estimated litigation settlement of $80.5 million, a $9.4 million write-off of information technology fixed assets that resulted primarily from the Company's rationalization of software, and a $5.5 million charge, net of non-controlling interests, representing the option premium for a currency hedge in connection with Apollo Global's acquisition of BPP.
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2010, was $817.7 million, or $5.35 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $688.8 million, or $4.32 per share for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2010, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,284.8 million as compared to $968.2 million as of August 31, 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to cash generated from operations, partially offset by share repurchases, capital expenditures, and an increase in restricted cash. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) increased by $138.4 million compared to August 31, 2009, primarily due to funds used to collateralize a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $126 million in connection with a program review of University of Phoenix by the U.S. Department of Education, as well as increased student deposits at University of Phoenix.
At August 31, 2010, accounts receivable decreased to $264.4 million from $298.3 million at August 31, 2009. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 30 days at August 31, 2010, compared to 32 days at August 31, 2009. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago is primarily attributable to a more pronounced seasonal increase in accounts receivable at August 31, 2009, due to University of Phoenix annual student financial aid system enhancements and upgrades.

Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $4.7 million to $584.4 million at August 31, 2010, from $589.1 million at August 31, 2009. Subsequent to August 31, 2010, the Company repaid approximately $400 million of the outstanding balance.
Share Repurchases
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $49.76 per share for a total expenditure of $100.0 million. As of August 31, 2010, approximately $561 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company expects fiscal 2011 to be a year of continuing transition in its operations as it implements initiatives, primarily at University of Phoenix, aimed at enhancing the student experience, expanding student protections and shifting the mix of enrollment to more experienced students who have a greater likelihood of succeeding in the Company's programs. Some of these initiatives include:
The Company expects that the implementation of these initiatives, together with the effect of other challenges the proprietary education industry is facing will adversely impact its operating metrics and financial results. Some of the industry challenges include ongoing regulatory and other scrutiny which has led to heightened media attention, much of which has portrayed the sector in an unflattering light. Given the transitional state of the business, and the uncertain regulatory environment, the Company is withdrawing its prior preliminary business outlook for fiscal 2011. However, the Company provides the following commentary:

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
