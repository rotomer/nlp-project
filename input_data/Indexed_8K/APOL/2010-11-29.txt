Today, our principal subsidiary, University of Phoenix, implemented a strategic reduction in force in which it eliminated approximately 700 full-time positions, principally among admissions personnel.
We expect to incur charges of approximately $5 million in the quarter ending November 30, 2010 in connection with this reduction in employment, and we expect to realize related employee compensation expense reductions of approximately $8 million per quarter, commencing in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
The personnel reductions are designed to streamline our operations and to better align our operations with our business strategy, refined business model and outlook.
