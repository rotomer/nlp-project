Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On March 29, 2011, Apollo Group, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three months ended February 28, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 2.02 by this reference.
     The information in Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K and the exhibit furnished herewith shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
     On March 24, 2011, the Board of Directors of Apollo Group, Inc. appointed Darby E. Shupp as a director of Apollo Group to fill an existing vacancy on the board.
     Ms. Shupp is employed by Exeter East, LLC, which is a holding company wholly-owned by Dr. John Sperling, Apollo Group's Executive Chairman. Ms. Shupp serves as an officer and/or director of various entities affiliated with Dr. Sperling and his investment company Moral Compass Corporation, including Arcadia Biosciences Inc. and ViaGen Inc.
     Ms. Shupp, who is 35 years old, received her Bachelor of Science degree in accountancy from Arizona State University and is a certified public accountant. Ms. Shupp will participate in the cash and equity compensation programs provided to Apollo Group's non-employee directors.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     As we previously disclosed, we received two demand letters from different shareholders in November and December 2010 to investigate, address and commence proceedings against each of our directors and certain of our officers for violation of any laws in connection with various corporate actions and developments over the past few years. This type of demand is a condition precedent under Arizona law to the filing of a derivative lawsuit on behalf of Apollo Group seeking damages from directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty.
     On March 24, 2011, after the finalization of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 28, 2011 and before the Form 10-Q was filed, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the State of Arizona, Maricopa County by Daniel Himmel, one of the foregoing shareholders who previously made a demand for investigation. In the complaint, the plaintiff asserts a derivative claim on our behalf against certain of our current and former officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants made improper statements and engaged in improper business practices that caused our stock price to drop, led to securities class actions against us, and enhanced regulation and scrutiny by various government entities and regulators. We have not yet been served with the complaint.
     The information in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject
 
to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.

The following exhibit is furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, March 29, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2011.
"During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we continued to execute on the key strategic initiatives that we've been developing and implementing, which are designed to enhance the student experience, expand student protections and ensure that we enroll students who we believe have a greater likelihood to succeed in our programs," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "While these initiatives are resulting in a period of transition for our business, we are pleased that we have recently begun to see signs of improvement in several of the leading indicators of future activity."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "While we are in the early stage of implementing these initiatives, we are excited to see some initial positive signs, such as improving rates of student retention for those who complete Orientation and subsequently enroll, a continued mix shift toward our higher degree-level programs, and lower bad debt expense. We believe these actions are the right things to do for our students, and importantly, we are confident that over time they will solidify our leadership role within the industry and put our organization on a path of more consistently delivering high quality growth."
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $1,048.6 million, which represents a 2.0% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2010, principally due to lower enrollments at University of Phoenix, partially offset by selective tuition price increases, a favorable mix shift toward higher degree-level programs, and improved student retention rates. University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 11.6% to 405,300 compared with the prior year's second quarter, primarily due to a 44.9% decrease in New Degreed Enrollment compared with the prior year period. The Company believes the decline in New Degreed Enrollment is primarily the result of the operational changes and initiatives it has implemented to more effectively support students and improve educational outcomes, including changes in the manner in which admissions and other employees are evaluated and compensated, the full implementation of University Orientation, and the continued refinement of the Company's marketing approaches to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in University of Phoenix's educational programs. Also contributing to the decrease in consolidated net revenue was a $6.4 million decrease in net revenue at Apollo Global in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, due to lower student enrollment at BPP and UNIACC.

The Company reported a loss from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2011, of $66.6 million, or $0.47 per share (142.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $103.2 million, or $0.67 per share (155.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2010.
Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of noncontrolling interests) and a $1.6 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and other estimated costs related to a securities class action lawsuit (). The Company recorded a tax benefit of $5.0 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes. The fiscal 2010 second quarter results included a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the previously mentioned securities class action lawsuit.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 28, 2011, was $118.2 million, or $0.83 per share (142.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $130.1 million, or $0.84 per share for the three months ended February 28, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory expenses increased by $6.2 million, or 1.5%, to $421.6 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase was primarily due to various strategic initiatives implemented to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes, which has resulted in increased compensation related to certain student advisory and infrastructure support functions and increased curriculum development and delivery costs.
Marketing expenses increased by $15.9 million, or 11.3%, to $157.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising expenditures, driven by the increased costs associated with the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in its educational programs and increases in advertising rates for traditional and online media due to increased competition for higher degree level students.
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $15.9 million, or 13.4%, to $102.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The decrease was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount, including the strategic reduction in force implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 that eliminated approximately 700 full-time positions, principally among admissions personnel. Compensation expense was favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately $8 million in the second
2
 
quarter of fiscal 2011 related to this reduction in force, the majority of which was in admissions advisory. This decrease was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $15.5 million, or 22.6%, to $84.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses associated with the Company's investments in its information technology resources and capabilities, as well as various expenses related to compliance and external affairs activities.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $28.3 million, or 38.4%, to $45.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment and improvements in student retention rates, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.9 million, or 11.1%, to $39.1 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011, compared to the three months ended February 28, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased depreciation related to computer equipment and software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets.

Unaudited First Six Months of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the six months ended February 28, 2011, was $2.4 billion, a 2.0% increase over the comparable period of fiscal 2010. The increase in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to selective tuition price increases at University of Phoenix, partially offset by a 3.2% decrease in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment during the six months ended February 28, 2011, as compared to the six months ended February 28, 2010. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $169.4 million, or $1.17 per share, (144.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), and $343.7 million, or $2.21 per share, (155.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2011, and February 28, 2010, respectively.
Results for the six months ended February 28, 2011 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of noncontrolling interests), a $2.5 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and other estimated costs related to a securities class action lawsuit (), and a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force, primarily at University of Phoenix. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $6.9 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes. Results for the six months ended February 28, 2010 contain a pre-tax charge of $44.5 million ($26.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the previously mentioned securities class action lawsuit and a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 28, 2011 was $357.1 million, or $2.47 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $359.2 million, or $2.31 per share, for the six months ended February 28, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 28, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,033.3 million as compared to $1,284.8 million as of August 31, 2010. The decrease is attributable to repayments on borrowings, share repurchases, capital expenditures and an increase in restricted cash, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) increased by $21.5 million compared to August 31, 2010, primarily due to increased student deposits associated with students receiving financial aid.
At February 28, 2011, accounts receivable decreased to $217.8 million from $264.4 million at August 31, 2010. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 22 days at February 28, 2011, compared to 30 days at August 31, 2010 and February 28, 2010. The decrease in DSO versus a
5
 
year ago is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment and improvements in student retention, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $393.4 million to $191.0 million at February 28, 2011, from $584.4 million at August 31, 2010. The decrease is due to the repayment of U.S. denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 1.8 million and 6.5 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $42.75 and $38.99 per share for a total expenditure of $75.0 million and $251.5 million during the three and six months ended February 28, 2011, respectively. As of February 28, 2011, approximately $525 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.
Business Outlook
The Company offers the following commentary regarding the outlook for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 based on the business trends observed during the second quarter of fiscal 2011, as well as management's current expectations of future trends, which could change.

This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in
7
 
our non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
