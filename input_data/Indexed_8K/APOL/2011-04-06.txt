Dismissal of Teamsters Local Union Putative Class Action Lawsuit
On March 31, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona dismissed with prejudice the lawsuit entitled, , Case Number 06-cv-02674-RCB, and entered judgment in favor of Apollo Group.
Teamsters Local 617 Pension & Welfare Funds v. Apollo Group, Inc. et al.
The lawsuit, which was filed in November 2006, alleged that we and certain of our current and former directors and officers violated federal securities laws by purportedly making misrepresentations concerning our stock option granting practices and related accounting. Plaintiffs sought to assert class action status on behalf of a class of Apollo Group shareholders who purchased our stock between November 2001 and October 2006. In March 2009, plaintiffs' amended complaint was dismissed in part, with leave to amend. The court has now issued a 78-page opinion dismissing plaintiffs' second amended complaint in its entirety and with prejudice, and has entered judgment in favor of Apollo Group and the individual defendants and against plaintiffs. We expect the plaintiffs to seek a reconsideration of this ruling and, if that is not successful, to appeal the ruling.
We have not previously accrued any liability associated with this matter.
For more information about this lawsuit, see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Form 10-K annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 21, 2010.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
