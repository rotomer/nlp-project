On May 2, 2011, Apollo Group, Inc. (the "Company") announced that Joseph L. D'Amico, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer, had adopted a prearranged stock trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Company's policies with respect to insider sales. The plan is limited to shares which may be acquired upon the exercise of stock options which expire in July 2011.
Rule 10b5-1 permits officers and directors of public companies to adopt predetermined plans for selling specified amounts of stock. Once a plan is established, the insider retains no discretion over sales under the plan and the prearranged trades are executed through a broker in accordance with the plan. The transactions under the plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
