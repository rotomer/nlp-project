     Today, Apollo Group, Inc. announced that a complaint filed by private relators under the Federal False Claims Act and California False Claims Act has been unsealed.

qui tam
United States of America and State of California, ex rel Derek Hoggett and Tavis Wood v. University of Phoenix, Apollo Group, et.al.
     The complaint alleges, among other things, that since December 12, 2009, University of Phoenix has violated the Federal False Claims Act and the California False Claims Act by falsely certifying to the U.S. Department of Education and the State of California that the University was in compliance with various regulations that require compliance with federal rules regarding the payment of incentive compensation to enrollment personnel, in connection with the University's participation in student financial aid programs. The relators seek injunctive relief, fines, treble damages and other damages on behalf of the U.S. and the State of California.
     The U.S. Department of Justice and the State of California have declined to intervene in the case.
     Apollo Group is evaluating the complaint and expects to be served by the relators in due course.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
