Exhibit 99.1
Phoenix, June 30, 2011  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2011.
"During the third quarter, we continued to execute on our key initiatives to improve outcomes, enhance student protections, and elevate the educational experience throughout every touch point of the student lifecycle," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "We are encouraged by the progress we are making in improving retention rates and continuing to shift the mix of our students toward higher degree level programs."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We are committed to differentiating the University of Phoenix by focusing on academic quality and delivering a world class student experience. Our actions, over time, are intended to elevate the brand and reputation of our institutions, improve student outcomes, reduce enterprise risk, and position us for stable, long-term growth."
Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 totaled $1,235.8 million, which represents a 7.6% decrease from the third quarter of fiscal 2010, principally due to lower enrollments at University of Phoenix, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 16.4% to 398,400 compared with the prior year third quarter, primarily due to decreases in New Degreed Enrollment in recent quarters, including a 40.5% decrease in New Degreed Enrollment in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with the prior year period. The Company believes the decline in New Degreed Enrollment is primarily the result of the operational changes and initiatives it has implemented to more effectively support students and improve educational outcomes, as well as the broader competitive environment. The operational changes include the manner in which admissions personnel and other employees are evaluated and compensated, the full implementation of University Orientation, and the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in University of Phoenix's educational programs.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2011, of $211.9 million, or $1.51 per share (140.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $177.2 million, or $1.16 per share (152.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2010.
 
Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 contain special items that include a $2.0 million pre-tax charge ($1.2 million net of tax) for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and future estimated legal costs related to a securities class action lawsuit () and a tax benefit of $9.6 million resulting from the resolution with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the deductibility of payments made to settle a lawsuit in fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2010 third quarter results contain special items that include a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million ($7.5 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest) and a $132.6 million pre-tax charge ($79.9 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the securities class action lawsuit mentioned above. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2011, was $203.5 million, or $1.45 per share (140.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2010 of $264.6 million, or $1.74 per share (152.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding). (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory expenses increased by $16.4 million, or 3.7%, to $458.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to various strategic initiatives implemented to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes, which have resulted in increased compensation expense related to certain student advisory and infrastructure support functions and increased curriculum development and delivery costs.
Marketing expenses increased by $9.4 million, or 6.2%, to $161.0 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising expenditures, driven by the increased costs associated with the Company's efforts to more effectively identify students who have a greater likelihood to succeed in its educational programs and increases in advertising rates for traditional and online media due to increased competition for higher degree level students and improving general economic conditions.
Admissions advisory expenses decreased by $16.4 million, or 14.1%, to $99.9 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The decrease was a result of lower admissions advisory headcount primarily attributable to a strategic reduction in force implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 that eliminated approximately 700 full-time positions, principally among admissions personnel. This decrease was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative ("G&A") expenses increased by $12.5 million, or 16.6%, to $87.9 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses associated with higher employee
 
compensation costs and other expenses associated with the Company's investments in its information technology resources and capabilities.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased by $32.8 million, or 45.5%, to $39.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from Associates to higher degree-level programs, and improvements in student retention rates, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix, which were favorably impacted by ongoing process improvements and an initiative to address the Company's oldest receivables, also contributed to the decrease.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $4.4 million, or 12.1%, to $41.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended May 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased depreciation related to information technology, network infrastructure and software, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of BPP intangible assets and depreciation of principal office buildings in respect of which the Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 versus the prior-year period.
 
 
 
Unaudited First Nine Months of Fiscal 2011 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the nine months ended May 31, 2011, was $3.6 billion, a 1.5% decrease from the comparable period of fiscal 2010. The decrease in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to a 6.6% decrease in University of Phoenix's average Degreed Enrollment in the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2010, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes at University of Phoenix. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $381.3 million, or $2.66 per share, (143.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding), and $520.9 million, or $3.37 per share, (154.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010, respectively.
Results for the nine months ended May 31, 2011 contain special items that include goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests), a $4.5 million charge for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and future estimated legal costs related to a securities class action lawsuit (), and a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force, primarily at University of Phoenix. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $7.7 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges, along with a tax benefit of $9.6 million resulting from the resolution with the Internal Revenue Service regarding the deductibility of payments made to settle a lawsuit in fiscal 2010. Results for the nine months ended May 31, 2010 included a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million ($7.5 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interest), a $177.1 million pre-tax charge ($106.8 million net of tax) representing an accrual related to the securities class action lawsuit mentioned above, and a tax benefit of $11.4 million resulting from the settlement of disputed tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment in either period, as it is not deductible for tax purposes.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the nine months ended May 31, 2011 was $560.6 million, or $3.91 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $623.8 million, or $4.04 per share, for the nine months ended May 31, 2010. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of May 31, 2011, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1,426.3 million as compared to $1,284.8 million as of August 31, 2010. The increase is attributable to cash generated from operations, a decrease in restricted cash, and proceeds from the sale-leaseback of the Company's principal office buildings in Phoenix, Arizona, partially offset by repayments on borrowings, share repurchases and capital expenditures. Restricted cash and cash equivalents (including long-term) decreased by $194.3 million compared to August 31, 2010, primarily due to the return of funds associated with the release of the Company's cash- collateralized letter of credit in the amount of approximately $126 million in connection with a previous program review of University of Phoenix by the U.S. Department of Education.
 
At May 31, 2011, accounts receivable decreased to $227.2 million from $264.4 million at August 31, 2010. Excluding accounts receivable and the associated net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding ("DSO") was 23 days at May 31, 2011, compared to 30 days at August 31, 2010 and May 31, 2010. The decrease in DSO versus a year ago is primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable as a result of decreases in New Degreed Enrollment, a shift in the mix of students from associates to higher degree-level programs, and improvements in student retention, partially due to the full implementation of University Orientation. Improved collection rates at University of Phoenix also contributed to the decrease.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $389.1 million to $195.3 million at May 31, 2011, from $584.4 million at August 31, 2010. The decrease is due to the repayment of U.S. denominated borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 4.1 million and 10.6 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $40.26 and $39.48 per share for a total expenditure of $167.3 million and $418.7 million during the three and nine months ended May 31, 2011, respectively. At May 31, 2011, $11.8 million was recorded in accrued liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for repurchased shares that settled subsequent to May 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2011, approximately $357.7 million remained available under the Company's current share repurchase authorization.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the
 
non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
