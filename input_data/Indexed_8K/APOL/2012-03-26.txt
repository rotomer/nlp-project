Phoenix, March 26, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) ("Apollo Group," "Apollo" or the "Company") today reported financial results for the three and six months ended February 29, 2012.
Second Quarter 2012 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
"Empowering our students to achieve their desired academic and life outcomes is our highest priority," said Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. "We are building on our mission to provide world class education, as well as connecting education to careers, in order to further differentiate University of Phoenix. We are committed to leading education into the future."
Apollo Group Co-Chief Executive Officer Chas Edelstein added, "We are working to continually improve our services to students to enhance their educational experience and outcomes. As we pursue opportunities for increased operating efficiency, our efforts to optimize allow us to invest in innovation and create new and better ways to reach adult learners, while keeping education affordable and accessible and delivering the best possible experience to our students."
Unaudited Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $969.6 million, which represents a 7.5% decrease compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease is the result of an 8.0% decrease in University of Phoenix net revenue, due principally to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 12.2% to 355,800, largely due to the decrease in New Degreed Enrollment during fiscal year 2011. The Company believes the decrease in 2011 New Degreed Enrollment was primarily the result of a number of important changes and initiatives implemented in recent years to more effectively support students and enhance their educational outcomes. Although University of Phoenix New Degreed Enrollment increased 1.0% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we believe it has been impacted by changes in marketing content and channels to better identify potential students more likely to succeed at University of Phoenix, by changes in economic conditions and, in particular, an improving U.S. labor market, as well as by a continuing robust competitive environment.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 29, 2012, of $63.9 million, or $0.51 per share (126.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to a loss from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $66.6 million, or $0.47 per share (142.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2011.
Results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $16.1 million associated with the Company's real estate rationalization plan.
Results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 included the following:
 
 
 
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended February 29, 2012, was $73.8 million, or $0.58 per share (126.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $118.2 million, or $0.83 per share (142.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended February 28, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory increased $7.9 million, or 1.9%, to $429.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 410 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The expense increase was primarily related to the Company's initiatives, including technology, to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes.
Marketing increased $2.0 million, or 1.3%, to $159.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 140 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. Marketing expense included costs attributable to establishing relationships with employers and community colleges.
Admissions advisory decreased $0.9 million, or 0.9%, to $101.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 60 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. While admissions advisory headcount decreased, the cost savings was offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative decreased $0.3 million, or 0.4%, to $84.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue.
Depreciation and amortization increased $2.8 million, or 7.3%, to $42.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 60 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase is principally attributable to $3.1 million of intangible asset amortization in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 as a result of the Carnegie Learning acquisition.
The provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased $14.5 million, or 31.9%, to $31.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 110 basis point decrease as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable associated with decreased University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment; a decrease in the proportion of receivables that are attributable to students enrolled in associate's degree programs, as collection rates for these students are generally lower compared to students in more advanced level programs; and improved collection rates due, in part, to process initiatives implemented in fiscal year 2011.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Group's unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 versus the prior-year period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unaudited First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Consolidated net revenue for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $2.1 billion, which represents a 9.6% decrease compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2011. The decrease in consolidated net revenue was primarily attributable to University of Phoenix's 10.1% decrease in net revenue principally due to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. In the first six months of fiscal year 2012, University of Phoenix's Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 15.6% as compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2011. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 29, 2012, of $213.2 million, or $1.66 per share, (128.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $169.4 million, or $1.17 per share, (144.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the six months ended February 28, 2011.
Results for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 contained special items that include $21.7 million of restructuring and other charges associated with the Company's real estate rationalization plan and $16.8 million of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges for the UNIACC subsidiary of Apollo Global ($14.4 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests). The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, as they are not deductible for tax purposes. Results for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 include goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $219.9 million for the BPP subsidiary of Apollo Global ($188.3 million net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests); a $3.8 million restructuring charge associated with a strategic reduction in force; and $2.5 million of charges for accrued incremental post-judgment interest and other estimated costs related to the securities class action lawsuit. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $5.0 million, net of noncontrolling interests, associated with these charges. The Company did not record a net tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment, as it is not deductible for tax purposes.
Policeman's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago
Excluding these special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the six months ended February 29, 2012, was $241.0 million, or $1.87 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $357.1 million, or $2.47 per share, for the six months ended February 28, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of February 29, 2012, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $800.7 million, compared to $1,571.7 million as of August 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to payments on borrowings, share repurchases, funding a common fund account associated with our preliminary settlement in a legal matter, the purchase of Carnegie Learning and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations.
As of February 29, 2012, accounts receivable decreased to $207.1 million from $215.6 million at August 31, 2011. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Company's days sales outstanding was 22 days as of February 29, 2012, which remained consistent compared to 23 days as of August 31, 2011, and 22 days as of February 28, 2011.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) decreased by $471.5 million to $127.5 million as of February 29, 2012, from $599.0 million as of August 31, 2011. The decrease is due to the repayment of the borrowings on the Company's $500 million credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 6.4 million and 8.1 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $51.65 and $50.42 per share for a total cost of $328.8 million and $407.0 million during the three and six months ended February 29, 2012, respectively. Additionally, subsequent to February 29, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a total cost of $92.5 million, resulting in $0.5 million remaining of the current share repurchase authorization.
SEC Update

This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations; (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods; and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of
performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
