Unaudited Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $1,130.8 million, which represents an 8.5% decrease compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease was the result of a 9.1% decrease in University of Phoenix net revenue, due principally to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 13.1% to 346,300. New Degreed Enrollment decreased 8.0%, or 5.3% adjusting for available start dates, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2012, of $134.0 million, or $1.13 per share (118.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $211.9 million, or $1.51 per share (140.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the three months ended May 31, 2011.
Results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 included the following:
 
 
Results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 included the following:
 
 
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended May 31, 2012, was $142.3 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $203.5 million, or $1.45 per share for the three months ended May 31, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory increased $12.0 million, or 2.6%, to $470.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 450 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The expense increase was primarily related to the Company's initiatives, including technology, to more effectively support students and improve their educational outcomes. This was partially offset by a decrease in costs that are more variable in nature such as faculty and certain advisory functions.
Marketing decreased $2.2 million, or 1.3%, to $158.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 110 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in expense was principally attributable to lower advertising costs, offset by costs attributable to establishing relationships with employers and community colleges.
Admissions advisory decreased $4.6 million, or 4.6%, to $95.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 30 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. While admissions advisory headcount decreased, the cost savings was partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative increased $0.2 million, or 0.3%, to $88.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue.
Depreciation and amortization increased $4.0 million, or 9.8%, to $45.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 70 basis point increase as a percentage of net revenue. The increase was principally attributable to $3.1 million of intangible asset amortization in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 as a result of acquiring Carnegie Learning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable ("bad debt expense") decreased $3.8 million, or 9.7%, to $35.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, which represents a 10 basis point decrease as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable principally resulting from decreases in University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment.

Net revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $3.3 billion, which represents a 9.2% decrease compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. The decrease in net revenue was primarily attributable to University of Phoenix's 9.7% decrease in net revenue principally due to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2012, University of Phoenix's Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 15.0% as compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the nine months ended May 31, 2012, of $347.2 million, or $2.77 per share, (125.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), and $381.3 million, or $2.66 per share, (143.2 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding) for the nine months ended May 31, 2011.

As of May 31, 2012, the Company's cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $602.1 million, compared to $1,571.7 million as of August 31, 2011.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Company's results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations, (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Company's performance on a consistent basis across time periods, and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Company's management in its own evaluation of
performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
