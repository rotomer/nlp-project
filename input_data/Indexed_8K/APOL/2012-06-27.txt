Item 8.01 Other Events.
Apollo Group, Inc. announced today that it has been informed by the U.S. Department of Education that the Department intends to conduct an off-site program review focused on University of Phoenix's compliance with requirements to verify student supplied information and report to the Department appropriate verification status codes relating to the federal student financial aid (Title IV) programs in which the University participates. The review, which is scheduled to commence on July 16, 2012, initially will cover the federal financial aid award years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 to date. The Department informed the University that an examination of the University's verification reporting for the 2010-2011 award year identified the University as having misreported verification status codes.
The information in Item 8.01 of this Form 8-K shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
