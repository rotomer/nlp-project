APOLLO GROUP, INC. REPORTS FISCAL 2012 FOURTH QUARTER AND
YEAR-END RESULTS
Phoenix, October 16, 2012  Apollo Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) (Apollo Group, Apollo or the Company) today reported financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2012.
This past year, we have made great strides in executing on our strategy to differentiate University of Phoenix, diversify Apollo Group, and refine our business processes and delivery structure to be more efficient and effective, while providing a world class student experience, said Apollo Group Chief Executive Officer and Apollo Global Chairman Greg Cappelli. As we build the university of the future, our priority is to connect education to careers for our students, helping them achieve their desired academic and life outcomes.
Unaudited Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Results of Operations
Net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $996.5 million, which represents an 11.0% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease was due principally to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. For the quarter, University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment decreased 13.8% to 328,400 and New Degreed Enrollment decreased 13.7% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2012, of $52.6 million, or $0.46 per share (113.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $189.7 million, or $1.38 per share (137.3 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for the three months ended August 31, 2011.
Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 include restructuring and other charges of $9.4 million ($6.0 million net of tax and the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests) associated with a series of restructuring activities to reengineer business processes and refine the Companys delivery structure. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 also contained special items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information tables of this press release.
Excluding the special items noted above, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for the three months ended August 31, 2012, was $58.6 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $140.7 million, or $1.02 per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2011. (See the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information in the tables section of this press release.)
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the Company completed the disposition of BPP Holdings Limiteds (BPP) subsidiary Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), a UK secondary education institution, for 54.8 million (equivalent to $85.3 million as of the date of sale). The Company recognized a gain on sale of $26.7 million, net of transaction costs, and has reported MPWs operating results as discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented.
Operating Expenses
Instructional and student advisory increased $20.4 million, or 4.7%, to $455.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The expense increase was primarily related to the Companys initiatives to more effectively support students and enhance their educational experience and outcomes, including investments in adaptive learning, curriculum development, the new learning and service platforms, and initiatives to connect education to careers. This was partially offset by a decrease in costs that are more variable in nature such as faculty and certain student advisory functions.
Marketing increased $9.7 million, or 5.7%, to $180.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The increase was principally attributable to higher employee compensation and other costs, including expense related to building employer relationships, partially offset by lower advertising costs.
Admissions advisory decreased $13.6 million, or 13.7%, to $85.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The decrease was principally attributable to lower admissions advisory headcount, partially offset by higher average employee compensation costs.
General and administrative decreased $6.2 million, or 6.2%, to $92.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.
Depreciation and amortization increased $3.2 million, or 7.7%, to $44.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The increase was principally attributable to higher intangible asset amortization as a result of acquiring Carnegie Learning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and increased capital expenditures and capital leases in recent years primarily related to information technology.
Provision for uncollectible accounts receivable (bad debt expense) decreased $0.9 million, or 2.3%, to $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The expense decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in gross accounts receivable principally resulting from decreases in University of Phoenix Degreed Enrollment.
Financial and Operating Metrics
Below are Apollo Groups unaudited financial data and operating metrics for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 versus the prior-year period.
Unaudited 2012 Fiscal Year Results of Operations
Net revenue for fiscal year 2012 totaled $4.3 billion, which represents a 9.7% decrease compared to fiscal year 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to University of Phoenixs 10.2% decrease in net revenue principally due to lower University of Phoenix enrollment, partially offset by selective tuition price and other fee changes. In fiscal year 2012, University of Phoenixs Average Degreed Enrollment decreased 14.8% as compared to fiscal year 2011.
The Company reported income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for fiscal year 2012, of $393.7 million, or $3.22 per share (122.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), compared to $566.3 million, or $4.00 per share (141.8 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), for fiscal year 2011. Results for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 contained special items, which are detailed in the reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information tables of this press release. Excluding the special items, income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group for fiscal year 2012 was $435.7 million, or $3.56 per share, compared to income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo Group of $696.5 million, or $4.91 per share for fiscal year 2011.
Unaudited Balance Sheet
As of August 31, 2012, the Companys cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $1.3 billion, compared to $1.6 billion as of August 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to share repurchases, capital expenditures, and the purchase of Carnegie Learning, partially offset by cash provided by operations, and proceeds from the disposition of Mander Portman Woodward.
As of August 31, 2012, accounts receivable decreased to $198.3 million from $215.6 million at August 31, 2011. Excluding accounts receivable and the related net revenue for Apollo Global, the Companys days sales outstanding was 22 days as of August 31, 2012, as compared to 23 days as of August 31, 2011.
Total debt outstanding (including short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt) increased by $120.9 million to $719.9 million as of August 31, 2012, from $599.0 million as of August 31, 2011. Subsequent to August 31, 2012, the Company repaid the $615.0 million drawn on its revolving credit facility.
Share Repurchases
The Company repurchased approximately 2.0 million and 19.1 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $31.60 and $41.82 per share for a total cost of $63.5 million and $799.5 million during the three and twelve months ended August 31, 2012, respectively.
Optimization Initiatives
The Company continues initiatives to reengineer business processes and refine its delivery structure, while maintaining a commitment to enhance the student educational experience and outcomes. These activities, including the actions discussed below, are expected to favorably impact annual operating expenses by at least $300 million by fiscal year 2014, when compared to fiscal year 2012. The Company expects to realize more than half of these cumulative cost savings in fiscal year 2013, with the remainder in fiscal year 2014.
As part of the reengineering initiative, University of Phoenix is realigning its ground locations throughout the U.S., which will directly impact approximately 4% of total Degreed Enrollment, or around 13,000 students. These students will be offered support to continue their education at the University of Phoenix either online, through alternative on-ground arrangements or, in limited cases, at existing University of Phoenix locations. This plan includes closing 115 locations, consisting of 90 learning and student resource centers, which are generally smaller satellite locations, and 25 campuses. University of Phoenix will
preserve a national coast-to-coast network of 112 locations and plans to retain a presence in 36 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Subject to regulatory approvals, the realignment is expected to be substantially complete in fiscal year 2013. The Company expects to incur approximately $175 million of restructuring and other charges, principally for lease exit and other related costs, with most of these costs incurred in fiscal year 2013. The Company plans to continue investing in its ground locations to create state-of-the art, technologically-integrated facilities offering academic and career support and increased mobile connectivity, while also continuing to advance its leading-edge online learning platform.
The Company has also begun implementing a workforce reduction and expects to decrease total headcount, excluding faculty, by approximately 800 employees during fiscal year 2013. The Company anticipates incurring approximately $25 million of restructuring and other charges in fiscal year 2013 related to workforce reductions.
Apollo Global, Inc.
On October 12, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with The Carlyle Group and closed the purchase of Carlyles remaining 14.4% noncontrolling ownership interest in Apollo Global, Inc. for $42.5 million in cash, plus a contingent payment based on a portion of the Apollo Global operating results through the fiscal years ending August 31, 2017.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release and the related conference call contain non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to supplement, but not substitute for, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Management uses, and chooses to disclose to investors, these non-GAAP financial measures because (i) such measures provide an additional analytical tool to clarify the Companys results from operations and help to identify underlying trends in its results of operations, (ii) as to the non-GAAP earnings measures, such measures help compare the Companys performance on a consistent basis across time periods, and (iii) these non-GAAP measures are employed by the Companys management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision-making processes, such as budgeting and forecasting. Exclusion of items in the non-GAAP presentation should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Other companies, including other companies in the education industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure across companies.
