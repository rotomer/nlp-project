Exhibit 99: - ----------- AIRGAS News Release Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ---------------- ------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS REPORTS FISCAL FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS RADNOR, PA - July 29, 2002 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its first quarter ended June 30, 2002. Net earnings for the quarter, excluding certain charges, were $16.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to $13.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow per diluted share for the quarter was negative $0.03 versus $0.23 in the prior year. As disclosed in the notes to the attached financial statements, the results reported above for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 exclude restructuring and divestiture charges. Results reported above for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 exclude a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the accounting for goodwill. Including the charges related to the restructuring, divestitures and change in accounting principle, the reported net earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 were $0.20 versus a net loss of $0.67 for the comparable prior year quarter. "We continue to deliver strong earnings performance in the face of difficult market conditions," commented Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "EPS increased 15%, excluding certain charges. Improved gross margins reflecting an expanded gas and rent sales mix, as well as effective expense management and favorable interest rates, primarily contributed to this performance. After-tax cash flow also remained strong, but the timing of payments for certain accrued expenses resulted in an increase in net working capital, which negatively impacted free cash flow."
McCausland continued, "The first quarter performance was bolstered by the business acquired from Air Products, which surpassed our earnings projections and was slightly accretive this quarter because of the low interest rate environment. Integration of the acquired assets is going well and we are on track to realize projected synergies." While fiscal first quarter sales of $458 million increased 10%, total same-store sales declined 2% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and other industrial customer segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were down 2%, reflecting an increase of 1% for gases and rent and a 5% decline in hardgoods. Same-store sales for the Gas Operations segment decreased 3%. Year-to-date capital spending was $14 million versus $17 million last year. "Although operating conditions have been difficult, we have not sacrificed long-term value for short-term gains and we continue to invest in our infrastructure initiatives as planned," added McCausland. "While we wait for sustained signs of an economic recovery, we remain focused on growing market share, cost management and driving efficiency through our integrated distribution system. We believe that leveraging the capabilities of our infrastructure will not only improve our cost position in the near term, but position us for greater growth when the economy strengthens." Free cash flow is defined as after-tax cash flow (net earnings, excluding certain gains and charges, plus depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes), minus capital spending, plus/minus the change in working capital, excluding the impact of the accounts receivable securitization and certain gains and charges.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release may contain statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: favorable interest rates; the successful integration of acquired assets and being on track to realize projected synergies; an uncertain near-term economic outlook; focusing on growing market share, cost management and driving efficiency through our integrated distribution system; and leveraging the capabilities of our infrastructure to improve our cost position in the near term and position us for greater growth when the economy strengthens. Airgas intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include the success of the Company's integration of the acquired Air Products packaged gas business; the success of the Company's strategic initiatives in improving operational efficiency, and growing sales and market share; an economic downturn (including adverse changes in the specific markets for our products); increased competition; customer acceptance of the Company's products; adverse changes in customer buying patterns; adverse changes in general economic conditions; political and economic uncertainties associated with current world events; and other factors described in the Company's reports, including Form 10-K dated March 31, 2002, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated condensed balance sheets follow.
Notes: (a) Special charges of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax) for the three months ended June 30, 2002 consist of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain of the Company's procurement functions. The special charges include facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain Airgas facilities and severance for approximately 130 employees. (b) Other income (expense), net, for the three months ended June 30, 2002 includes a net non-recurring loss of approximately $200 thousand ($500 thousand after-tax) related to divestitures. (c) In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142 on April 1, 2001, the Company performed an evaluation of goodwill, which indicated that goodwill of one reporting unit, its tool business, was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $59 million non-cash charge recorded retroactive to April 1, 2001 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The impaired goodwill was not deductible for taxes, and consequently, no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the charge. (d) Net earnings, adjusted to exclude the items described in notes (a), (b) and (c). (e) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175 million of qualified trade receivables. Net proceeds from the securitization were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $140 million and $134 million at June 30, 2002 and March 31, 2002, respectively.
