EXHIBIT 99.1 - ------------ Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Rd. Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 AIRGAS News Release www.airgas.com _____________________________________________________________________ Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ----------------- -------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS SECOND QUARTER EPS INCREASES 29% TO 27 CENTS RADNOR, PA - October 23, 2002 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its second quarter ended September 30, 2002. Net earnings for the quarter were $19.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $14.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Net earnings for the six months ended September 30, 2002, excluding certain restructuring and divestiture charges, were $0.49 per diluted share compared to prior year results of $0.41 per diluted share, on a pro forma basis. Results for the six months ended September 30, 2001 exclude a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the accounting for goodwill. Free cash flow per diluted share for the six-month period was $0.62 versus $0.40 in the prior year, driving debt reduction of $40 million. Including the charges related to the restructuring and divestitures, the reported net earnings per diluted share for the six months ended September 30, 2002 were $0.46 versus $0.41 for the comparable prior year period, on a pro-forma basis. For the six months ended September 30, 2001, including the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, the Company reported a net loss of $0.45 per diluted share. "Our ability to grow earnings per share by 29% and generate strong cash flow in the quarter demonstrates the resiliency of our gas business, even during difficult economic times," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Our underlying business, reinforced by the Air Products packaged gas acquisition, remains on track. We also benefited from much lower than projected financing costs for the acquisition. We are improving gross margins, in part, due to a stronger gas and rent sales mix, and we remain diligent about controlling costs. I am also pleased to report that we continue executing well against our financial goals, increasing operating margin by almost 100 basis points to 9.4%."
McCausland continued, "We believe that we are still on track to achieve earnings per share of $0.92 to $0.94 for the full year, although the environment is tougher than expected. We remain focused on our strategic initiatives designed to improve our low-cost position and grow market share, as these will help drive shareholder value until we see sustained signs of improvement in the industrial economy." While the acquisition helped increase second quarter sales 9% to $451 million, total same-store sales declined 3% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and other industrial customer segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were down 3%, reflecting slight growth for gases and rent and a 7% decline in hardgoods. Same-store sales for the Gas Operations segment increased 2%. Year-to-date capital spending was $34 million versus $28 million last year. Free cash flow is defined as after-tax cash flow (net earnings, excluding certain gains and charges, plus depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes), minus capital spending, plus/minus the change in working capital, excluding the impact of the accounts receivable securitization and certain gains and charges.

Airgas intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include the success of the Company's integration of the acquired Air Products packaged gas business; the success of the Company's strategic initiatives in improving operational efficiency and growing sales and market share; an economic downturn (including adverse changes in the specific markets for our products); increased competition; customer acceptance of the Company's products; adverse changes in customer buying patterns; adverse changes in general economic conditions; political and economic uncertainties associated with current world events; and other factors described in the Company's reports, including Form 10-K dated March 31, 2002 and Form 10-Q dated June 30, 2002, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated condensed balance sheets follow.
Notes: (a) Special charges of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax) for the six months ended September 30, 2002 consist of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain of the Company's procurement functions. The special charges include facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain Airgas facilities and severance for approximately 130 employees. (b) Other income (expense), net, for the six months ended September 30, 2002 includes a net non-recurring loss of approximately $200 thousand ($500 thousand after-tax) related to divestitures. (c) In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142, the six months ended September 30, 2001 includes a $59 million non-cash charge recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The impaired goodwill was not deductible for taxes, and consequently, no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the charge.
