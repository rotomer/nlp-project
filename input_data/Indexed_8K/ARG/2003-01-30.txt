Exhibit 99: - ---------- AIRGAS News Release Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ---------------- ------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: Immediately AIRGAS THIRD QUARTER EPS INCREASES 35% TO 23 CENTS RADNOR, PA - January 29, 2003 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its third quarter ended December 31, 2002. Net earnings for the quarter were $16.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $11.8 million, or $.17 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. The reported net earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended December 31, 2002 were $0.69 versus a net loss of $0.28 for the prior year period, which included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the accounting for goodwill. Excluding the change in accounting and certain restructuring and divestiture charges (see note (d) to the attached financial statements), net earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended December 31, 2002, were $0.72 compared to the prior year's results of $0.57, on a pro forma basis. Free cash flow per diluted share for the nine-month period was $0.99 versus $0.82 in the prior year, driving debt reduction of $69 million. Year-to-date capital spending was $52 million versus $41 million last year. Fiscal 2003 capital spending includes $8 million for the construction of the liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice manufacturing plant in Hopewell, VA. "Airgas delivered solid third quarter results reflecting outstanding execution in a weak economic environment," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Our strategic initiatives focused on market share growth and operating cost management contributed to the performance. We also paid down $30 million of debt in the quarter, which reflects the company's tremendous free cash flow." McCausland continued, "We expect our operating momentum to continue through our fourth quarter, bolstering performance in soft market conditions. Therefore, we estimate our fourth quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.26. The outlook for
fiscal 2004 remains cloudy, as some positive economic indicators are still shadowed by a very weak industrial economy. However, we believe that, barring further deterioration of the U.S. economy, our acquisition synergies and strategic initiatives will enable earnings per share growth of at least 10%." While third quarter sales increased 11% to $435 million, total same- store sales declined 1% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and other industrial customer segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were down 1%, reflecting growth of 2% for gases and rent and a 5% decline in hardgoods. Same-store sales for the Gas Operations segment increased by 1%. Free cash flow is defined as after-tax cash flow (net earnings, excluding certain gains and charges, plus depreciation, amortization and deferred income taxes), minus capital spending, plus/minus the change in working capital (adjusted for the impact of certain gains and charges), excluding the impact of the trade receivables securitization.

These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: continued operating momentum bolstering performance in soft market conditions; earnings per share for the fourth quarter and following fiscal year; acquisition synergies and strategic initiatives enabling earnings per share growth. Airgas intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include the success of the Company's integration of the acquired Air Products packaged gas business; the success of the Company's strategic initiatives in improving operational efficiency and growing sales and market share; an economic downturn; increased industry competition; adverse changes in customer buying patterns; significant fluctuations in interest rates; adverse changes in general economic conditions; political and economic uncertainties associated with current world events; and other factors described in the Company's reports, including Form 10-K dated March 31, 2002 and Form 10-Q reports dated June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated condensed balance sheets follow.
Notes: (a) Special charges of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax) for the nine months ended December 31, 2002 consist of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain of the Company's procurement functions. The special charges include facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain Airgas facilities and severance for approximately 130 employees. (b) Other income (expense), net, for the nine months ended December 31, 2002 includes a net non-recurring loss of approximately $200 thousand ($500 thousand after-tax) related to divestitures. Other income (expense), net, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2001 includes a net non-recurring gain of approximately $1.9 million ($120 thousand after-tax). The net non-recurring gain consisted of a $7.4 million gain on the divestiture of two nitrous oxide plants partially offset by a $1.9 million loss resulting from an indemnity claim against a prior period divestiture and a $3.6 million charge to write down a business unit held for sale to its net realizable value. (c) In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142, the nine months ended December 31, 2001 includes a $59 million non-cash charge recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The impaired goodwill was not deductible for taxes, and consequently, no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the charge. (d) Net earnings, adjusted to exclude the items described in notes (a), (b) and (c). (e) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175 million of qualified trade receivables.

The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $151 million and $134 million at December 31, 2002 and March 31, 2002, respectively.
