Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ___________________________________________________________ On May 7, 2003, Airgas, Inc. reported its earnings for its fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2003, as described in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Non-GAAP Measures: The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company uses Adjusted Debt Reduction to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the Company's ability to repay debt by adjusting for changes in the debt reported on the balance sheet for non-cash items and funds received under the trade receivables securitization program. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure of the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with meaningful insight into the ability of the Company to generate cash flow in excess of the cash required to maintain the Company's existing operations.

Exhibit 99.1 - ------------ AIRGAS News Release Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ---------------- ------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EPS OF $0.25 RADNOR, PA - May 7, 2003 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. Net earnings for the quarter were $18.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $8.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. The prior-year fourth quarter included a charge related to a litigation settlement of $8.5 million ($5.7 million after tax) or $.08 per diluted share. The reported net earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended March 31, 2003 were $68.1 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to $48.6 million, or $0.69 per diluted share for the prior year. Net earnings per diluted share were $0.94 for year ended March 31, 2003 versus a loss of ($0.15) in the prior year, which reflects a change in accounting for goodwill. Fiscal 2003 earnings reflect a first quarter restructuring charge of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $.03 per diluted share related to the integration of the Air Products acquisition. "The weak industrial economy created a very tough sales environment in fiscal 2003. However, we remained focused on executing our strategic initiatives, pursuing growth in niches like medical and specialty gas, and integrating acquired assets," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "I am very proud of the drive and determination displayed by all Airgas associates during the year." While fourth quarter sales increased 6% to $443 million, total same- store sales declined 1% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and other industrial segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were down 2%, reflecting a 4% decline in hardgoods while gas and rent was flat. Same- store sales for the Gas Operations segment increased 6%.
The Company continued to generate strong free cash flow during fiscal 2003, enabling it to reduce adjusted debt by $96 million. In line with the new guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission on the use of non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has revised the calculation of its liquidity measure "Free Cash Flow", making this useful measure more transparent and traceable to the Statement of Cash Flows. The new definition of Free Cash Flow and a reconciliation to the attached Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as well as the definition of adjusted debt and reconciliation to the balance sheet are attached. Free Cash Flow for the year ended March 31, 2003 was $104 million versus $133 million in the prior year. The fiscal 2003 decline in free cash flow reflects an investment in the new liquid CO2 plant in Hopewell, VA; a cash disbursement related to a prior year litigation settlement; and higher cash interest payments on the prior year's subordinated debt issuance resulting from a long first coupon period. McCausland continued, "The year ahead looks like it may not be an easy one as we could face as many challenges as opportunities, but I believe we are a strong organization with the ability to execute in any environment. We expect to continue growing our earnings and project to earn between $1.05 and $1.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2004. The low end of the range reflects a continuation of the current environment and the high end assumes improvement."
