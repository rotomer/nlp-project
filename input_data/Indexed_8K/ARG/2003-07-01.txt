Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure ________________________ In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's interim guidance regarding Form 8-K Item 12 filing requirements as set forth in Release No. 33-8216, the following information is intended to be furnished by Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") under Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," rather than under Item 9. The information in this Form 8-K report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. On June 27, 2003, the Company began mailing for distribution to its stockholders its annual report and definitive proxy statement. The Company's annual report includes a Financial Highlights section (on page 17 of the annual report) that contains certain material financial information relating to fiscal years 1999 through 2003. The following financial information had not previously been disseminated to the public: The Company has provided the following reconciliations of these non- GAAP financial metrics to their most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles on page 62 of the annual report.
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited) The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides investors meaningful insight into the ability of the Company to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used to make acquisitions, repay debt or support other investing and financing activities. The Company believes that diluted earnings per share, excluding certain gains and charges noted above, are more indicative of the Company's on-going operations and provide investors meaningful trend information. (1) Average capital employed represents total assets plus trade receivables under the securitization program, less accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The Company believes this return on capital computation provides investors a measure to reflect the relationship between operating results and average capital employed. This measure helps investors assess how effectively the Company uses the capital invested in its operations.
Signatures __________ Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
