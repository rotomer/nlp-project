Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure ________________________ In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's interim guidance regarding Form 8-K Item 12 filing requirements as set forth in Release No. 33-8216, the following information is intended to be furnished by Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") under Item 12, "Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," rather than under Item 9. The information in this Form 8-K report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. On July 24, 2003, Airgas, Inc. reported its earnings for its first quarter ended June 30, 2003, as described in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. Non-GAAP Measures: The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company uses Adjusted Debt to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the change in the Company's obligation to repay debt by adjusting for non-cash items and funds received (or repaid) under the trade receivables securitization program. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure of the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with meaningful insight into the ability of the Company to generate cash flow in excess of the cash required to maintain the Company's existing operations.

AIRGAS News Release Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- EXHIBIT 99.1 - ------------ Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ---------------- ------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EPS OF $0.25 RADNOR, PA - July 24, 2003 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its first quarter ended June 30, 2003. Net earnings for the quarter were $18.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to $14 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. As disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, the quarter ended June 30, 2002 included a special charge of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share related to the integration of the Air Products acquisition. First quarter sales increased 1% to $461 million, while total same-store sales declined 1% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and other industrial segments. Same- store sales in the Distribution segment were down 2%, driven by a 4% decline in hardgoods. Same-store sales for the Gas Operations segment increased 9%, attributed to strong sales at the new Hopewell, Virginia CO2 plant, which began operations in January 2003. "We delivered a solid first quarter performance. The prolonged weakness in the industrial sector continues to temper top-line results, but strength in our growth platforms, such as medical and bulk gas, and a focus on cost control contributed to the EPS growth," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. Free Cash Flow for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 was a negative $3 million contributing to a $5 million increase in adjusted debt. Free Cash Flow for the comparative quarter ended June 30, 2002 was a negative $5 million. Negative free cash flow is typical in the first quarter due to the timing of payments for interest and annual bonuses; however, the recently completed quarter also included $7 million of incremental capital spending versus the prior year as the Company invested in cylinders, tanks and other revenue generating assets to meet customer
needs. The definition of free cash flow and a reconciliation to the attached Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as well as the definition of adjusted debt and a reconciliation to the balance sheet are attached. McCausland continued, "Recent economic data on the industrial sector seems to indicate a slight firming, but it appears we are still bouncing along the bottom. We remain confident of our full year earnings per share guidance of $1.05 to $1.12; however, we expect same-store sales for the first half to be flat. We continue to focus on enhancing our market-leading customer offerings and service. Airgas has the financial capacity and the culture to succeed and grow, both organically and through acquisition."
