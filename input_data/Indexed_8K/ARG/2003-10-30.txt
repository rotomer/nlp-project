Non-GAAP Measures: - ----------------- The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities.

Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com AIRGAS NEWS RELEASE - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exhibit 99.1 Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ----------------- -------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EPS OF $0.26 RADNOR, PA - October 29, 2003 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its second quarter ended September 30, 2003. Net earnings for the quarter were $19.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $19.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Second quarter results include insurance-related losses of $2.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for previously announced incidents at two of the Company's facilities. Second quarter sales increased 2% to $460 million, while total same-store sales were essentially flat compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting continued weakness in manufacturing and other industrial segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were down 1%, driven by a 2% decline in hardgoods. Same-store sales for the Gas Operations segment increased 4%, attributed to sales from the Hopewell, Virginia CO2 plant, which began operations in January 2003. Net earnings for the six months ended September 30, 2003 were $0.51 per diluted share compared to prior year results of $0.46 per diluted share. The six months ended September 30, 2002 included charges of $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, related to a special charge for the integration of the Air Products acquisition ($2.7 million) and a net divestiture loss. "I am pleased with our operational and financial performance in the second quarter," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Airgas associates are managing well in a tough environment. We will continue to manage our costs conservatively until it becomes clearer that the industrial economy is on the mend." Free Cash Flow for the six months ended September 30, 2003 was $33 million compared to $29 million in the prior year, driving a $22 million reduction in adjusted debt. The definition of free cash flow and a reconciliation to the attached Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as well as the definition of adjusted debt and a reconciliation to the balance sheet are attached.
McCausland continued, "Daily sales rates improved sequentially throughout the quarter, with September posting the highest level we've seen since December. October trends are running slightly behind September. We are cautiously optimistic, although it is important to remember that the industrial economy still has a long road to recovery. We have adjusted the range for our full year earnings per share guidance to $1.03 to $1.10, specifically reflecting the insurance related losses of $0.02 per share in the second quarter."

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release may contain statements that are forward looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: continuing efforts to manage costs conservatively until the industrial economy strengthens; being cautiously optimistic about sales and the economy; and the range of expected earnings per share for fiscal 2004. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include: the success of the Company's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives of improving operational efficiency and growing sales and market share; an economic downturn; increased industry competition; adverse changes in customer buying patterns; significant fluctuations in interest rates; political and economic uncertainties associated with current world events; and other factors described in the Company's reports, including Form 10-K dated March 31, 2003 and Form 10-Q dated June 30, 2003, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated condensed balance sheets, consolidated statements of cash flows, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures follow.
Notes: (a) Special charges of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) for the six months ended September 30, 2002 consist of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of the Company's procurement functions. The special charges include facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain Airgas facilities and severance for approximately 130 employees. (b) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175 million of qualified trade receivables. Net proceeds from the securitization were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $152.7 million and $158.9 million at September 30, 2003 and March 31, 2003, respectively. (c) Since October 1999, the Company has leased certain real estate and equipment from a grantor trust (the "Trust") established by a commercial bank under a sale-leaseback arrangement. The Trust was not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Effective July 1, 2003, the Company has elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, which requires the consolidation of the Trust. The consolidation of the Trust resulted in the Company recording assets of $29 million and debt of $42 million, while eliminating a deferred gain of $13 million that was previously carried on the balance sheet as a long-term liability. Consolidation of the Trust was a non-cash transaction.
The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. (1) As a result of the consolidation of the Trust as disclosed in note (c), the lease obligation with the Trust has been classified as debt at September 30, 2003. The Company uses Adjusted Debt to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the change in the Company's obligation to repay debt by adjusting for non-cash items and funds received (or repaid) under the trade receivables securitization program.
