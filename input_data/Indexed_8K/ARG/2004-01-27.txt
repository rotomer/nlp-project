Exhibit 99.1 ____________ Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com AIRGAS News Release ___________________________________________________________________________ Investor Contact: Media Contact: ________________ _____________ Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: Immediately AIRGAS SIGNS LETTER OF INTENT TO ACQUIRE BOC'S U.S. PACKAGED GAS BUSINESS RADNOR, PA - January 27, 2004 -- Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) today announced it has signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire most of the assets of the U.S. packaged gas business of BOC Group (NYSE: BOX) in a transaction valued up to $200 million. The companies are working toward signing a definitive asset purchase agreement, which would be subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in mid 2004. The acquisition would include retail stores, warehouses, fill plants and other operations involved in distributing packaged gases and welding equip- ment sold through BOC's stores and distributors. The business includes the range of packaged industrial, medical and most specialty gases. The business to be acquired generated about $240 million in revenues in fiscal 2003. Approximately 65 percent of the revenues would be from gas sales and cylinder rent, with the remainder from welding hardgoods and supplies. The transaction would exclude packaged electronic gases, helium and hydrogen delivered in tube trailer or in liquid form, and bulk gases, including bulk medical and bulk gases supplied to its distributors. The transaction also would not affect BOC's merchant liquid and tonnage/on-site business in North America and its packaged gases businesses in other parts of the world.
"The completed transaction would be positive for our associates, our custom- ers and our shareholders," said Airgas Chairman and CEO Peter McCausland. "The operations are a strong strategic fit with our core business of dis- tributing industrial, specialty and medical gases and related supplies. They would add branches in selected markets in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast portions of the United States where we currently have little or no presence, as well as give us our first presence in Hawaii," he said. "Airgas has proven it can successfully acquire operations from major gas pro- ducers, as we did in 2002, and we intend to follow the same strategy of inte- grating these operations into our strong regional company network. Most of the acquired operations and related personnel would be integrated within Airgas' regional company structure. Airgas has formed an integration team with dedicated resources to manage a smooth transition for customers and associates," said McCausland. ABOUT AIRGAS, INC. Airgas, Inc.
