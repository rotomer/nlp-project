Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ___________________________________________________________ On January 28, 2004, Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") reported its earnings for its third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2003, as described in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The information contained in this Form 8-K report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. Non-GAAP Measures: _________________ The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. The Company uses the non-GAAP measure Adjusted Debt to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the change in the Company's obligation to repay debt by adjusting for the non-recourse debt of the National Welders joint venture, non-cash items and funds received (or repaid) under the trade receivables securitization program. The Company's intent is to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance investors'understanding of the Company's consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com AIRGAS NEWS RELEASE _____________________________________________________________________________ Investor Contact: Media Contact: Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com For release: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EPS OF $0.28 RADNOR, PA - January 28, 2004 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported earnings for its third quarter ended December 31, 2003. Net earnings for the quarter were $20.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $16.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. The results for the recently completed quarter include a non-recurring after-tax gain of $1.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, at National Welders Supply Company, a joint venture affiliate. Third quarter sales increased 3.8% to $451.9 million, and total same- store sales were up 1% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting some improvement in manufacturing and other industrial segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were up 1%, driven by a 3% gain in hardgoods and a slight gain in gas and rent. Same- store sales for the Gas Operations segment increased 1%. Net earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 were $0.79 per diluted share compared to prior year results of $0.69 per diluted share. The nine months ended December 31, 2003 include insurance-related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, for previously announced incidents at two of the Company's facilities, offset by the gain of $0.02 per diluted share mentioned above. The nine months ended December 31, 2002 included charges of $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to a special charge for the integration of the Air Products acquisition ($2.7 million). "I was pleased to see the sales momentum in the third quarter," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "We saw clear evidence of industrial recovery with good growth in our hardgoods business. The recovery is still in its early stages, so our outlook remains cautiously optimistic. However, as the industrial economy continues rebounding, we expect our higher margin gas business to respond as well, contributing favorably to overall profitability. Fourth quarter earnings are expected to range from $0.26 to $0.29 per diluted share."
Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 was $57 million compared to $71 million in the prior year. The year over year decline is attributable to inventory build related to the economic recovery and capital expenditures in growth areas including medical, microbulk and bulk gases. The Company reduced adjusted debt by $51 million through the third quarter. The definition of free cash flow and a reconciliation to the attached Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, as well as the definition of adjusted debt and a reconciliation to the balance sheet are attached. McCausland continued, "Earlier this week, we announced our intent to acquire the majority of BOC's U.S. packaged gas business. This is a good opportunity for Airgas, one which fills in some gaps in our national network and which will bring additional specialty gas capabilities. This proposed acquisition, which is expected to close in mid 2004, will build on our strengths and will help us meet our commitment to build value over the long term. We are positioned well financially to execute this transaction." The Company will conduct an earnings teleconference on Thursday, January 29, 2004, beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS __________________________ This press release may contain statements that are forward looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: remaining cautiously optimistic; the expectation that the gas business will respond as the industrial economy rebounds; the range of expected earnings per share for the fourth quarter; the intent to purchase the majority of BOC's U.S. packaged gas business; the expectation that the acquisition will close in mid 2004, build on the Company's strengths and help meet a commitment to build value over the long term. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward- looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include: the success of the Company's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives of improving operational efficiency and growing sales and market share; the Company's ability to acquire the majority of BOC's U.S. packaged gas business; an economic downturn; increased industry competition; adverse changes in customer buying patterns; significant fluctuations in interest rates; political and economic uncertainties associated with current world events; and other factors described in the Company's reports, including Form 10-K dated March 31, 2003 and Form 10-Q dated September 30, 2003, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated condensed balance sheets, consolidated statements of cash flows, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures follow.
Notes: (a) Special charges of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) for the nine months ended December 31, 2002 consist of a restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of the Company's procurement functions. The special charges include facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain Airgas (the "Company") facilities and severance for approximately 130 employees. (b) Equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2003 reflects a $1.7 million non-recurring after-tax gain. (c) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175 million of qualified trade receivables. Net proceeds from the securitization were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $156.2 million and $158.9 million at December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2003, respectively. (d) Since October 1999, the Company has leased certain real estate and equipment from a grantor trust (the "Trust") established by a commercial bank under a sale-leaseback arrangement. The Trust was not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Effective July 1, 2003, the Company elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") with respect to the Trust, which requires the consolidation of the Trust. The consolidation of the Trust resulted in the Company recording assets of $29 million and debt of $42 million, while eliminating a deferred gain of $13 million that was previously carried on the balance sheet as a long-term liability. Consolidation of the Trust was a non-cash transaction. (e) Since June 1996, the Company has participated in a joint venture with National Welders Supply Company, Inc. ("NWS"), a producer and distributor of industrial gases based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ownership interests in the joint venture consist of voting common stock and voting, redeemable preferred stock. The Company owns 100% of the joint venture's common stock, which represents a 50% voting interest. The Company does not hold a majority voting interest in the joint venture and, therefore, historically has used the equity method to account for its interest in the joint venture.
(e) continued The Company has determined that NWS meets the definition of a "Variable Interest Entity" under FIN 46 and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. Therefore, effective December 31, 2003, the Company elected to adopt FIN 46, as it applies to the joint venture, and consolidated NWS. At December 31, 2003, the consolidation of NWS only affects the balance sheet. There was no impact on net earnings or cash flows as a result of the consolidation. The consolidation has the effect of eliminating the Company's $62 million investment in NWS and recording the joint venture's assets, liabilities and a corresponding minority interest liability. The summarized impact of the consolidation of NWS at December 31, 2003 is reflected in the table below. Beginning January 1, 2004, NWS' operating results will no longer be reflected as "Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates." Rather, the operating results will be reflected broadly across the income statement with minority interest expense representing the after-tax portion of the operating results applicable to the preferred stockholders.
The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. (1) As a result of the consolidation of the Trust as disclosed in note (d), the lease obligation with the Trust has been classified as debt at December 31, 2003. (2) As a result of the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders as disclosed in note (e), debt associated with National Welders, which is non-recourse to Airgas, has been excluded from adjusted debt. The Company uses Adjusted Debt to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the change in the Company's obligation to repay debt by adjusting for the non-recourse debt of the National Welders joint venture, non-cash items and funds received (or repaid) under the trade receivables securitization program.
