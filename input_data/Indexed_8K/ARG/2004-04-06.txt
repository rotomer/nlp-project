Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com AIRGAS News Release - --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ----------------- -------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS AGREES TO ACQUIRE BOC'S U.S. PACKAGED GAS BUSINESS RADNOR, PA - April 2, 2004 -- Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) today announced it has signed a definitive asset purchase agreement to acquire most of the U.S. packaged gas business of The BOC Group, Inc. (NYSE: BOX) in a transaction valued up to $200 million. The companies first announced a letter of intent on January 27, 2004 and the FTC has since completed its regulatory review. The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close on or about July 31, 2004. The acquisition will include about 120 locations in 21 states, including retail stores, warehouses, fill plants and other operations involved in distributing packaged industrial, specialty and medical gases, as well as welding equipment and supplies sold through BOC's stores and distributors. Airgas intends to offer employment to more than 1,000 employees aligned with the operations, which generated about $240 million in revenues in fiscal 2003. Approximately 65 percent of the revenues were from gas sales and cylinder rent, with the remainder from welding hardgoods and supplies. The transaction will exclude packaged electronic gases, helium and hydrogen delivered in tube trailer or in liquid form, and bulk gases, including bulk medical and bulk gases supplied to BOC's distributors. The transaction also will not affect BOC's merchant liquid and tonnage/on-site business in North America and its packaged gases businesses in other parts of the world.
"This is a strategic opportunity in our core business that will improve our market position in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast portions of the United States, and add our first presence in Hawaii," said Airgas Chairman and CEO Peter McCausland. "These added sites will help us grow our core business, branch by branch, through a strong regional company network. The transaction also strengthens our position in two key growth areas, specialty and medical gases." In addition to the planned acquisition, the companies will sign reciprocal long-term supply agreements. Airgas will become the supplier for a substantial portion of BOC's resale packaged gas needs. BOC will supply liquid bulk gases to support the operations it is selling to Airgas. Most of the acquired operations and related personnel will be integrated within Airgas' regional company structure. All of BOC's Hawaiian operations will become an additional Airgas regional company. Operations in North Carolina and southern Virginia employing about 40 employees, will be sold to National Welders Supply Company, Inc., a joint venture between Airgas and the Turner family of Charlotte, NC. For more information on the sites to be acquired and future alignment, go to http://www.airgas.com/documents/pdf/BOCalignedsites.PDF "Airgas has a proven track record of successfully integrating both large and small acquisitions and we are confident in our ability to execute this transaction. Since completing the Air Products acquisition two years ago, we have announced nine add-on transactions. We also have paid down the majority of this acquisition debt. We are well positioned financially and able to finance this acquisition entirely with senior debt," said McCausland. The Company expects the acquired business to be $0.02-$0.04 accretive to EPS in the first 12 months, with up to $0.02 per share toward the end of FY05 and the balance in early FY06.
