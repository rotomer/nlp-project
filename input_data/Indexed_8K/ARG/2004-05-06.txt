Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ___________________________________________________________ On May 5, 2004, Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") reported its earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, as described in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The information contained in this Form 8-K report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing. Non-GAAP Measures: _________________ The press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 contains certain financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure that provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. The Company uses the non-GAAP measure Adjusted Debt to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the change in the Company's obligation to repay debt by adjusting for the non-recourse debt of the National Welders joint venture, non-cash interest rate hedging and funds received or repaid under the trade receivables securitization program. The Company's intent is to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1 - ------------ Airgas, Inc. 259 N. Radnor Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 www.airgas.com AIRGAS News Release - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Investor Contact: Media Contact: - ----------------- -------------- Melissa Nigro (610) 902-6206 James Ely (610) 902-6010 melissa.nigro@airgas.com jim.ely@airgas.com FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATELY AIRGAS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EPS GROWTH OF 16% RADNOR, PA - May 5, 2004 -- Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG) today reported strong sales, operating profit and earnings growth for its fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004. Net earnings for the quarter were $21.7 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $18.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter sales increased 18% to $522.1 million reflecting the consolidation of National Welders Supply Company - the Airgas joint venture affiliate - as well as acquisitions and same-store sales growth. Excluding National Welders, sales grew 9%. Total same-store sales were up 6% compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting significant improvement in manufacturing and other industrial segments. Same-store sales in the Distribution segment were up 6%, driven by gains of 9% in hardgoods and 2% in gas and rent. "Our sales momentum accelerated in the fourth quarter, including a very strong March for both gases and hardgoods," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Although sales growth was led by our lower-margin hardgoods products, the recovery in our business is unfolding as expected and the gases strength in March is very encouraging." Net earnings for the year ended March 31, 2004 were $1.07 per diluted share compared to prior year results of $0.94 per diluted share. The results for the year ended March 31, 2004 include a non-recurring after- tax gain of $1.7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, at National Welders Supply Company, and an after-tax $480 thousand special charge recovery related to a revised estimate on prior years' restructuring charges. Also included in the year ended March 31, 2004 are insurance-related losses of $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share, for previously announced incidents at two of the Company's facilities. The year ended March 31, 2003 included charges of $2.9 million ($2.2 million after tax), or $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to a special charge for the integration of the Air Products U.S. packaged gas acquisition ($2.7 million).
"We grew fiscal 2004 earnings per share by 10%, excluding the impact of special charges and recoveries, even though our markets didn't recover until late in the year," added McCausland. "I'm delighted to see the momentum, but most importantly, our results validate a strong and stable business model that can weather a tough economy." McCausland continued, "I'm excited about our growth opportunities ahead. During the last several years, we have built a tremendous infrastructure and product offering. With that behind us, we are now focused on growing our business, branch by branch, with those core customers who use gases, welding and safety products. We also plan to continue growing our medical business through Airgas Puritan Medical divisions in every regional company. Finally, we look forward to successfully completing our largest acquisition ever as we welcome the customers and associates from BOC's U.S. packaged gas business at the end of July. We expect to earn $1.21 to $1.27 per share in fiscal 2005, including up to $0.02 per share accretion from the BOC acquisition." Free Cash Flow for the year ended March 31, 2004 was $106 million compared to $104 million in the prior year. The Company reduced adjusted debt by $60 million during the fiscal year. The definition of free cash flow, a reconciliation to the attached Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the definition of adjusted debt and a reconciliation to the balance sheet are attached.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS -------------------------- This press release may contain statements that are forward looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the gases strength in March being encouraging; a focus on growing the business branch by branch; growing the medical business through Airgas Puritan Medical divisions; successfully completing the acquisition of BOC's U.S. packaged gas business and welcoming the customers and associates; the range of expected earnings per share for fiscal year 2005; and the expected accretion from the BOC acquisition. The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include: the success of the Company's ability to grow sales and market share; the closing of the Company's acquisition of the majority of BOC's U.S. packaged gas business; the successful integration of the BOC acquisition; the cost of integrating the BOC business into the Company's operations; an economic downturn; increased industry competition; adverse changes in customer buying patterns; significant fluctuations in interest rates; political and economic uncertainties associated with current world events; and other factors described in the Company's reports, including Form 10-K dated March 31, 2003 and Form 10-Q reports dated June 30, 2003, September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003, filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated condensed balance sheets, consolidated statements of cash flows, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures follow.
Notes: (a) Special charges of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after tax) for the year ended March 31, 2003 consist of a first quarter restructuring charge related to the integration of the business acquired from Air Products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and costs related to the consolidation of certain of the Company's procurement functions. The special charges include facility exit costs associated with the closure of certain Airgas (the "Company") facilities and severance. Special charge recoveries of $776 thousand ($480 thousand after tax) for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2004 consist of the reversal of the excess portion of prior years' restructuring charges. The special charge recoveries represent a change in estimate related to facility exit costs. (b) Equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended March 31, 2004 reflects a $1.7 million non-recurring after-tax gain. (c) The Company participates in a securitization agreement with two commercial banks to sell up to $175 million of qualified trade receivables. Net proceeds from the securitization were used to reduce borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities. The amount of outstanding receivables under the agreement was $162.6 million and $158.9 million at March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003, respectively. (d) Since October 1999, the Company has leased certain real estate and equipment from a grantor trust (the "Trust") under a sale- leaseback arrangement. The Trust was not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Effective July 1, 2003, the Company elected to early adopt Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") with respect to the Trust, which required the consolidation of the Trust. The consolidation of the Trust resulted in the Company recording assets of $29 million and debt of $42 million, while eliminating a deferred gain of $13 million that was previously carried on the balance sheet as a long- term liability. Consolidation of the Trust was a non-cash transaction. (e) Since June 1996, the Company has participated in a joint venture with National Welders Supply Company, Inc. ("NWS"), a producer and dis- tributor of industrial gases based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ownership interests in the joint venture consist of voting common stock and voting, redeemable preferred stock. The Company owns 100% of the joint venture's common stock, which represents a 50% voting interest. The Company does not hold a majority voting interest in the joint venture and, therefore, historically has used the equity method to account for its interest in the joint venture. The Company has determined that NWS meets the definition of a "Variable Interest Entity" under FIN 46R (FIN 46 as revised in December 2003) and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the joint venture. Therefore, effective December 31, 2003, the Company elected to adopt FIN 46R, as it applies to the joint venture, and consolidated NWS. The consolidation had the effect of eliminating the Company's $62 million investment in NWS and recording the joint venture's assets, liabilities and a corresponding minority interest liability. The summarized balance sheet impact of the consolidation of NWS at March 31, 2004 is reflected in the table below. Beginning January 1, 2004, NWS' operating results were no longer reflected as "Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates." Rather, the operating results were reflected broadly across the income statement with minority interest expense representing the after-tax portion of the operating results applicable to the preferred stockholders.
(e) Continued. Summarized Impact of the Consolidation of NWS at March 31, 2004 Current Assets $ 29,922 Non-Current Assets 109,750 ------- Total Assets 139,672 ======= Current Liabilities 21,217 Non-Current Liabilities 82,929 Minority Interest 36,191 Common Stockholder's Equity (665) ------- Total Liabilities and Stockholder's Equity $139,672 ======= (f) Business segment information Beginning with the Company's fiscal fourth quarter, the operating results of NWS were reported broadly across the income statement contributing $39.2 million to sales and $3.4 million to operating income. For the purpose of disclosing operating results by business segment, the Company renamed its Gas Operations segment as "All Other Operations" and disclosed the operating results of NWS with the results of the companies previously reported under that segment. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, the operating results of NWS were reported as a single line item, below operating income, entitled "equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates." The companies reporting their results under the All Other Operations segment consist of producers and distributors, principally of dry ice, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and specialty gases. The operating results of the Company's two air separation plants and its five most significant specialty gas labs are also reported under this segment. The operating results of these businesses are not material enough to meet the thresholds to be reported as individual business segments. NWS also has significant production capabilities with three air separation plants, two acetylene plants and a specialty gas lab. Although Airgas is the primary beneficiary of the NWS joint venture, the absence of a controlling voting interest, the significant production capabilities of NWS, the fact that the obligations of NWS are non- recourse to the Company and that the cash flows of NWS are not available to the Company, lead to the conclusion that NWS does not meet the criteria to be aggregated with the companies in the Distribution segment. Furthermore, NWS is not material enough to meet the thresholds to be reported as an individual business segment. Therefore, the results of NWS have been reflected in the All Other Operations segment as disclosed below:
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) - --------------------------------------------------------- (1) National Welders Supply Co. ("NWS") is a corporate joint venture meeting the definition of a variable interest entity and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary as described under FIN 46R. NWS was consolidated effective December 31, 2003 when the Company prospectively adopted FIN 46R as required by the interpretation. Prior to January 1, 2004, the Company reported the results of NWS below operating income in "Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates." The liabilities of NWS are non-recourse to the Company. Likewise, the cash flows in excess of the management fee paid by NWS are not available to the Company. Accordingly, the cash flows of NWS have been excluded from the Company's non-GAAP liquidity measures. The Company believes Free Cash Flow provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from continuing operations, which can be used at management's discretion for acquisitions, the repayment of debt or to support other investing and financing activities. Reduction of Adjusted Debt: --------------------------- Reconciliation of the change in debt per the Balance Sheet to the decrease in debt adjusted for the non-recourse debt of NWS, off- balance sheet financing and non-cash interest rate hedging ("adjusted debt"): (1) As a result of the consolidation of the Trust as disclosed in note (d), the lease obligation with the Trust has been classified as debt at March 31, 2004. (2) As a result of the December 31, 2003 consolidation of National Welders as disclosed in notes (e) and (f), debt associated with National Welders, which is non-recourse to Airgas, has been excluded from adjusted debt. The Company uses Adjusted Debt to provide investors with a more accurate and meaningful measure of the change in the Company's obligation to repay debt by adjusting for the non-recourse debt of NWS, non-cash interest rate hedging and funds received (or repaid) under the trade receivables securitization program.
