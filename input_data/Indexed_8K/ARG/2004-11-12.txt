We delivered these results in a very weak industrial market. Today, the business outlook is very good, and we have many acquisition opportunities."

We are focused on the future and will pursue our goals by following a consistent strategic direction." President and Chief Operating Officer Glenn Fischer commented that the integration of the BOC business is progressing smoothly. He also commented on an improving pricing environment and sales momentum in strategic growth platforms of bulk, medical and specialty gases, safety products and strategic accounts.
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Roger Millay outlined financial expectations including: o FY05 diluted earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.27, including BOC integration/restructuring costs of $0.05 per share o FY06 BOC EPS accretion of $0.08-$0.10, including modest integration/restructuring costs o BOC business to be at a "full integration" run-rate of 14- 15% EBITDA margin by mid-FY06 Millay also commented on the Company's commitment to strong controllership and enhancing its financial profile through a strong free cash business model and multiple earnings levers.
