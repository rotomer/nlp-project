For release:
Immediately
Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the plan, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its common stock over a three year period as market conditions permit. As of November 3, 2005, Airgas had approximately 77,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding.
RADNOR, PA  November 15, 2005 
"Our decision to initiate a share repurchase plan reflects the Company's strong financial position," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Our business is performing well and our cash flow is very strong. As a result, we have the liquidity necessary to continue investing for growth, increase the dividend over time and repurchase shares. We're targeting $30 million to $50 million of repurchases per year, but will maintain the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances. We believe that this plan will enhance long-term value creation for Airgas shareholders."
