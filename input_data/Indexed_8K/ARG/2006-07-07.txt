Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On or about June 30, 2006, Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") began mailing its annual report (the "Annual Report") and definitive proxy statement to its stockholders. The Letter to Shareholders section of the Annual Report includes a line graph (on page 11) depicting Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Interest Expense, and Stockholders Equity from fiscal 1989 through fiscal 2006. The line graph is attached as Exhibit 99.1 under Item 9.01 and is incorporated herein by reference. The Sales, Interest Expense and Stockholders Equity data used to derive the line graph were previously disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K filings for the respective years presented. The current presentation of the Adjusted EBITDA measure had not been previously disseminated to the public and is furnished in this Form 8-K.
Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company believes adjusted EBITDA provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from operations to support required working capital, capital expenditures and financial obligations. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles appears on page 69 of the Annual Report and is also included below:
Eighteen Year Reconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA to Cash from Operations
Table of Contents
The Company's Annual Report also includes a Financial Highlights section (on page 17) that contains Return on Capital financial information relating to fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Return on Capital is a financial measure that is not defined under GAAP. The Company believes that the Return on Capital computation helps investors assess how effectively the Company uses the capital invested in its operations. A reconciliation of Return on Capital appears on page 69 of the Annual Report and is also included below:
Reconciliation and Computation of Return on Capital
Table of Contents
The Company's intent is to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance investors' understanding of the Company's consolidated financial statements and should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The information contained in this Form 8-K report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
