Item 2.04
Triggering Events that Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement
On September 27, 2006, Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") announced that it has elected to redeem its 9.125% senior subordinated notes due October 1, 2011 (the "Notes"). The Company will redeem the $225 million notes in full at a premium of 104.563% of the principal amount on October 27, 2006 (the "redemption date"). The Company expects to record a charge on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $12 million (about $8 million after tax or $0.10 per diluted share) in its fiscal third quarter ending December 31, 2006. The charge relates to the redemption premium and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.
The election to exercise the redemption provision of the Notes accelerates the maturity date of the Notes to the redemption date. The Company will finance the redemption of the Notes with borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Under existing covenant restrictions, the Company's liquidity will not be significantly affected by the redemption of the Notes. Based on current interest rates under the revolving credit facility, interest savings are estimated to be $500 thousand per month.
The Company's press release announcing the redemption of the Notes is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
