Exhibit 99.1
          
For release:
Immediately
Airgas, Inc., (NYSE: ARG), the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, welding, safety, and related products, today reported strong growth in sales, operating income, and earnings for its second quarter ended September 30, 2006.
RADNOR, PA  October 25, 2006 
Quarterly net earnings grew 33% to $40 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $30 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. The current quarter includes stock-based compensation expense of $0.03 per diluted share related to the adoption of SFAS 123R, . The prior year second quarter included charges of $0.02 per diluted share for asset losses related to hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Share-Based Payment
Second quarter sales grew to $791 million, up 13% over the prior year. Total same-store sales were up 11%, with hardgoods up 10% and gas and rent up 11%, reflecting a supportive pricing environment and solid demand in the industrial production, energy, and non-residential construction segments.
"Our core and growth strategies are yielding outstanding results for shareholders," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Sales growth remains strong across our core markets and strategic products."
McCausland continued, "We expanded our operating margins by 170 basis points over last year, to 10.7%, and Return on Capital* was up 230 basis points, to 12.8%, reflecting revenue gains and operating efficiencies, as well as disciplined capital spending and asset management."
As previously announced, the company will redeem its 9.125% Senior Subordinated Notes on October 27, 2006. The redemption will result in a charge of $0.10 per diluted share in October, with estimated future interest savings of $500 thousand per month.

Including the impact of the debt retirement and related interest savings, the company expects EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter of $0.37 to $0.39 per diluted share, and $0.49 to $0.52 per diluted share for the fourth quarter.
"We are experiencing strong business conditions across the board. Excluding a $0.10 third quarter charge for early extinguishment of debt*, we expect to earn $0.47 to $0.49 per diluted share in the third quarter, and we are increasing our full-year continuing operations EPS guidance to $1.93 to $1.98," said McCausland.
