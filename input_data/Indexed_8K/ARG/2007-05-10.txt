Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
     On May 8, 2007, pursuant to a stockholder rights plan (the ""), dated as of May 8, 2007, between Airgas, Inc.

     The rights (the "") previously issued under a stockholder rights plan, dated as of April 1, 1997, between the Company and the Rights Agent, expired by their terms on April 1, 2007 and are no longer in effect. As a result, the April 1997 Rights may not be exercised.
April 1997 Rights
     The following summary of the principal terms of the Rights Agreement is a general description only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed terms and conditions set forth in the Rights Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein will have meanings given such terms in the Rights Agreement. A copy of the Rights Agreement (which Rights Agreement includes as Exhibits the Form of Certificate of Designations for the Preferred Stock, the Form of Right Certificate and the Summary of Rights) is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Rights Evidenced by Common Stock Certificates; Distribution Date
     Initially, the Rights will be evidenced by the certificates representing shares of Common Stock then outstanding, and no separate Right Certificates will be distributed. In general, the Rights will separate from the Common Stock and become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) ten calendar days following a public announcement or disclosure that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "") has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% (or 20% in the case of Peter McCausland or certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "") and (ii) ten business days or a later date as is determined by the Board after the commencement of, or first public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% (or 20%, as the case may be) or more of such outstanding shares of Common Stock (the earlier of such dates being called the "").
Acquiring Person
Stock Acquisition Date
Distribution Date
     Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates and will be transferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates, (ii) new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record Date will contain in accordance with the Rights Agreement a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Stock outstanding will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates.
Expiration of Rights; Issuance of Rights Certificates
     The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the close of business on May 8, 2017, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company as described below.
     As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, Right Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and thereafter, the separate Right Certificates alone will represent the Rights. Except as otherwise provided by the Rights Agreement or determined by the Board, only shares of Common Stock issued prior to the Distribution Date will be issued with Rights.
 
Right to Purchase Company Common Shares
     In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of Common Stock (or in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of such an event or any other Triggering Event (as defined below), all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person will be null and void.
Right to Purchase Acquiring Company Shares
     After the Stock Acquisition Date, in the event that (i) the Company consolidates or merges with any other person, and the Company is not the surviving corporation, (ii) any person engages in a share exchange, consolidation or merger with the Company where the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are exchanged for securities, cash or property of the other person and the Company is the surviving corporation or (iii) 50% or more of the Company's assets or earning power is sold or transferred, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. The events set forth in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph are referred to as the "."
Triggering Events
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution
     The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities, cash or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to customary adjustments from time to time to prevent dilution in the event of certain changes in the shares of the Company. With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price.
Redemption
     In general, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.0001 per Right (subject to adjustment), at any time before to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the day a person becomes an Acquiring Person and (ii) the close of business of the expiration date of the Rights. Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the $0.0001 redemption price.
Exchange Provision
     At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person (but before such Acquiring Person owns 50% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock), the Board may exchange the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (other than those owned by an Acquiring Person), for shares of Common Stock, each Right being exchangeable for one share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment.
No Shareholders' Rights Prior to Exercise
     Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
Amendment of the Rights Agreement
     Other than those provisions relating to the principal economic terms of the Rights, any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board prior to the earliest of (i) the Distribution Date or (ii) a Triggering Event. After the first to occur of such events, the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended without the approval of any holders of Rights Certificates (x) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained in the Rights Agreement which may be defective or inconsistent with the other provision contained therein, or (y) to make any other changes or provisions in regard to matters or questions arising thereunder which the Company may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such supplement or amendment shall adversely affect the interests of
 
the holders of Rights as such (other than an Acquiring Person, or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person), and no such supplement or amendment may cause the Rights again to become redeemable at such time as the Rights are not then redeemable or cause the Rights Agreement again to become amendable other than as provided for in the Rights Agreement.
Certain Anti-Takeover Effects
     The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company and will not do so; however the Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board and without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. However, the Rights help ensure that the Company's stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company. The execution of the Rights Agreement by the Company is not in response to any specific takeover threat or proposal, but is a precaution taken to protect the rights of the Company's stockholders.

     (b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); , , that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $0.01 per share on the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
however
     (c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all
 
such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
     Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
     (a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case, if an equivalent dividend is not declared on the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Certificate, in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or by law, the holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
     (c) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class together with holders of any other shares of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are then exercisable, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) Directors.
default period

shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of such preferred stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of such preferred stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2) Directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of such preferred stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of such preferred stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of such preferred stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
          (iii) Unless the holders of such preferred stock shall during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of such preferred stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of special meeting of the holders of such preferred stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (c)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of such preferred stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than twenty (20) days and not later than sixty (60) days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within sixty (60) days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of such preferred stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (c)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within sixty (60) days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
          (iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of such preferred stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of such preferred stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (c) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
 
          (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of such preferred stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of such preferred stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Certificate or by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Certificate or by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.
     (d) Except as set forth herein, holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
     Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
     (a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 herein are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

          (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
          (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or
 
          (vi) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
     (b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under Section 4(a) herein, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
     Section 5. . Any Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued preferred stock of the Corporation and may be reissued as part of a new series of preferred stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Certificate, or in any other certificate of designation creating a series of preferred stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
Reacquired Shares
     Section 6. .
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
     (a) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to $10,000 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment (the ""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series C Liquidation Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Common Stock shall have received an amount per share (the "") equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series C Liquidation Preference by (ii) 10,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth in subparagraph (c) below to reflect such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the ""). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.

     (b) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of shares of Common Stock.
     (c) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     Section 7. . In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Amendment
     Section 11. . Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Thereupon the Rights Agent shall, subject to Section 4(b), Section 7(e), Section 11 and Section 14, countersign and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment by the holder of a Right Certificate of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.

In the event the Company is obligated to issue other securities (including shares of Common Stock) of the Company or distribute other property pursuant to Section 11(a), the Company will make all arrangements necessary so that such other securities or property are available for distribution by the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate. The Company reserves the right to require prior to the occurrence of a Triggering Event that, upon any exercise of Rights, a number of Rights be exercised so that only whole shares of Preferred Stock would be issued.

The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section 4(b) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Rights or any other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to any Acquiring Person or an Associate or Affiliate of an Acquiring Person or their transferees.
     (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported transfer or exercise unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate following the form of assignment or election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such assignment or exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.

     (c) If then required by applicable law, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the earliest date after the first occurrence of a Triggering Event in which the consideration to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of the Rights has been determined in accordance with this Agreement, or as soon as is required by law following the Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock or other securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (B) the Final Expiration Date. If then required by applicable law, the Company will also take such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days after the date set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 9(c), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect, in each case with simultaneous written notice to the Rights Agent. In addition, if the Company determines that a registration statement should be filed under the Securities Act or any securities laws following the Distribution Date, the Company may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights in each relevant jurisdiction until such time as a registration statement has been declared effective and, upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect, in each case with simultaneous written notice to the Rights Agent. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction if the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall not have been obtained or be obtainable or the exercise thereof shall not be permitted under applicable law or a registration statement shall not have been declared effective. The Rights Agent may assume that any Right exercised is permitted to be exercised under applicable law and shall have no liability for acting in reliance upon such assumption.

     (d) The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock or other securities (including, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, shares of Common Stock) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such shares (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.
     (e) The Company further covenants and agrees that, subject to Sections 6 and 7(c), it will pay when due and payable any and all taxes and governmental charges that may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities or assets, as the case may be) upon the exercise of Rights.

Each Person in whose name any certificate for a number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities, as the case may be) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities, as the case may be) represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable taxes and governmental charges) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which such shares of the Preferred Stock (or Common Stock or other securities, as the case may be) transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares (fractional or otherwise) on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which such shares of Preferred Stock (or Common Stock or other securities, as the case may be) transfer books of the Company are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate, as such, shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.

To the extent that the Company determines that some action should be taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 7(e), that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of additional securities and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect, in each case with simultaneous written notice to the Rights Agent. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the shares of Common Stock shall be the current per share market price per share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, and the value of any "common stock equivalent" shall be deemed to have the same value as the shares of Common Stock on such date.

In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes. Shares of Preferred Stock owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, and in the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

     (c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness, cash or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend out of the earnings or retained earnings of the Company or a dividend payable in shares of Preferred Stock but including a dividend payable in stock other than shares of Preferred Stock) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b)), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the current per share market price of shares of Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) on such record date less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes) of the portion of the cash, assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to a share of Preferred Stock and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the shares of Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)). Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price that would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
     (d) For the purpose of any computation hereunder (other than computations made pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii)), the "current per share market price" of the shares of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such shares of Common Stock for the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days immediately prior to but not including such date, and for purposes of computations made pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii), the "current per share market price" of shares of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such shares of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days immediately following but not including such date; , , that in the event that the current per share market price of the shares of Common Stock is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such shares of Common Stock of (1) a dividend or distribution on such shares of Common Stock payable in such shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into such shares of Common Stock (other than the Rights), or (2) any subdivision, combination consolidation, reverse stock split or reclassification of such shares of Common Stock, and prior to the expiration of the requisite thirty (30) Trading Days, or ten (10) Trading Days, as set forth above, after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination, consolidation, reverse stock split or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to take into account ex-dividend trading.

Automated Quotation System ("") or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the shares of Common Stock are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the shares of Common Stock selected by the Board. If on any such date no market maker is making a market in the shares of Common Stock, the fair value of the shares of Common Stock on such date as determined in good faith by the Board shall be used. The term "" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.

For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as set forth above for shares of Common Stock in this Section 11(d) (other than the last sentence thereof). If the current per share market price of shares of Preferred Stock cannot be determined in the manner provided above or if shares of Preferred Stock are not publicly held or listed or traded in a manner described above, the current per share market price of shares of Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to 10,000 (as such number may be appropriately adjusted for such events as stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to shares of Common Stock occurring after the date of this Agreement) multiplied by the current per share market price of shares of Common Stock. If neither shares of Common Stock nor shares of Preferred Stock are publicly held or so listed or traded, or the subject of available bid and asked quotes, the current per share market price of shares of Preferred Stock shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board or Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Right Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes.

     (h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest one-millionth) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
     (i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, and shall provide written notice of such election to the Rights Agent, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates

Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
     (j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock that were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.

If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30)-days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), the holder of record of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States so long as such Person is authorized under such laws to exercise stock transfer powers, is in good standing, and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority, and has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000).

Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent

of the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the holders of record of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
     SECTION 22. . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date (other than upon exercise of a Right) and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company (a) shall, with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee plan or arrangement, or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities hereinafter issued by the Company, and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; , , that (i) no such Right Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or to the Person to whom such Right Certificate would be issued, and (ii) no such Right Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustments shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.

Redemption and Termination
     (a) The Board may, at its option, at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the Close of Business on the date a Person becomes an Acquiring Person and (ii) the Close of Business on the Final Expiration Date, redeem all, but not less than all, of the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.0001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the ""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event payment of the Redemption Price to a holder of Rights would result in the payment of an amount not equal to $0.01 or an integral multiple of $0.01, the amount to be paid shall be rounded upward to the next $0.01. The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of Common Stock (based on the current market price per share at the time of redemption) or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 23, (x) the redemption of the Rights by the Board may be made effective at such time on such basis and with such conditions as the Board, in its sole discretion, may establish and (y) any such redemption will be effective immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the same, unless such action of the Board expressly provides that such redemption shall be effective at a subsequent time or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more specified events (in which case such
Redemption Price
 
redemption shall be effective in accordance with the provisions of such action of the Board).
     (b) Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. Within ten (10) days after action of the Board ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to all such holders at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the Transfer Agent for the shares of Common Stock. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 and Section 24 and other than in connection with the purchase of shares of Common Stock prior to the Distribution Date.
     SECTION 24. .
Exchange
     (a) The Board may, at its option, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e)) for shares of Common Stock, each Right being exchangeable for one share of Common Stock, appropriately adjusted to reflect any transaction specified in Section 11(p) occurring after the date hereof (such number of shares of Common Stock issuable in exchange for one Right being referred to herein as the ""). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than any Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding.
Exchange Shares
     (b) Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive the Exchange Shares. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to the Rights Agent and to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based
provided
however
 
on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e)) held by each holder of Rights.
     (c) In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding, or authorized but unissued, to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional shares of Common Stock for issuance upon exchange of the Rights or shall take such other action specified in Section 11(a)(iii). Further, in any exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Company, at its option, may substitute shares of Preferred Stock for shares of Common Stock at the rate of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock for each Right.
     (d) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates that evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock (except as hereinafter provided) or fractional shares of Common Stock, but if the exchange is for shares of Preferred Stock, the Company shall be obligated to issue fractional shares so long as any faction of a share of Preferred Stock so to be issued is at least equal to one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock. In lieu of such fractional shares, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Rights Certificates with regard to which such fractional shares would otherwise be issuable an amount of cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share. For the purposes of this subsection (d), the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock shall be the closing price of a share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 24.
     SECTION 25. .
Notice of Certain Events
     (a) In case the Company shall propose, at any time after the Distribution Date, (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its shares of Preferred Stock or to make any other distribution to the holders of its shares of Preferred Stock (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its shares of Preferred Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional shares of Preferred Stock or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its shares of Preferred Stock (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with any other Person (other than a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction that complies with Section 11(o)), or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions, each of which complies with Section 11(o)), or (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, to the extent feasible and in accordance with Section 26, a notice of such proposed action that shall specify the record date for the purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or
 
warrants, or the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the shares of Preferred Stock for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock, whichever shall be the earlier.

Designation and Amount
     Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
     (a) Subject to the prior and superior rights with respect to dividends of the holders of any shares of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of Common Stock and other junior stock, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose,
 
quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of January, April, July and October in each year or such other quarterly payment date as shall be specified by the Board of Directors (each such date being referred to herein as a ""), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) $0.01 or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock, $.01 par value (the ""), of the Corporation since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
Common Stock
Rights Declaration Date
     (b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); , , that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $0.01 per share on the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
however
     (c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative
 
from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
     Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
     (a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case, if an equivalent dividend is not declared on the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     (b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Certificate, in any other Certificate of Designation creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or by law, the holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
     (c) (i) If at any time dividends on any Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein called a "") which shall extend until such time when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. During each default period, all holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock with dividends in arrears in an amount equal to six (6) quarterly dividends thereon, voting as a class together with holders of any other shares of Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are then exercisable, irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two (2) Directors.
default period
          (ii) During any default period, such voting right of the holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a
 
special meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(c) or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that such voting right shall not be exercised unless the holders of ten percent (10%) in number of shares of preferred stock having the voting rights set forth above that are outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of such preferred stock of such voting right. At any meeting at which the holders of such preferred stock shall exercise such voting right initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as may then exist up to two (2) Directors or, if such right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two (2) Directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of such preferred stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of such preferred stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of such preferred stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
          (iii) Unless the holders of such preferred stock shall during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of such preferred stock outstanding, irrespective of series, may request, the calling of special meeting of the holders of such preferred stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a Vice-President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of preferred stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this Paragraph (c)(iii) shall be given to each holder of record of such preferred stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier than twenty (20) days and not later than sixty (60) days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within sixty (60) days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of such preferred stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph (c)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the period within sixty (60) days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.
          (iv) In any default period, the holders of Common Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the whole number of Directors until the holders of such preferred stock shall have exercised their right to elect two (2) Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of such preferred stock shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as provided in Paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a majority
 
of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the class of stock which elected the Director whose office shall have become vacant. References in this Paragraph (c) to Directors elected by the holders of a particular class of stock shall include Directors elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the foregoing sentence.
          (v) Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right of the holders of such preferred stock as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the holders of such preferred stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in the Certificate or by-laws irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section 3 (such number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by law or in the Certificate or by-laws). Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.
     (d) Except as set forth herein, holders of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
     Section 4. .

Preferred Stock and holders of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively.
     (b) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series C Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other series of preferred stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of shares of Common Stock.
     (c) In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
     Section 7. . In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series C Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

Amendment
     Section 11. .

     The following summary of the principal terms of the Rights Agreement is a general description only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the detailed terms and conditions set forth in the Rights Agreement.
Rights Evidenced by Common Stock Certificates; Distribution Date
     Initially, the Rights will be evidenced by the certificates representing shares of Common Stock then outstanding, and no separate Right Certificates will be distributed. In general, the Rights will separate from the Common Stock and become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) ten calendar days following a public announcement or disclosure that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "") has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% (or 20% in the case of Peter McCausland or certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "") and (ii) ten business days or a later date as is determined by the Board after the commencement of, or first public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% (or 20%, as the case may be) or more of such outstanding shares of Common Stock (the earlier of such dates being called the "").
Acquiring Person
Stock Acquisition Date
Distribution Date
     Until the Distribution Date, (i) the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates and will be transferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates, (ii) new Common Stock certificates issued after the Record Date will contain in accordance with the Rights Agreement a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Stock outstanding will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates.
 
Expiration of Rights; Issuance of Rights Certificates
     The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the close of business on May 8, 2017, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company as described below.
     As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, Right Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and thereafter, the separate Right Certificates alone will represent the Rights. Except as otherwise provided by the Rights Agreement or determined by the Board, only shares of Common Stock issued prior to the Distribution Date will be issued with Rights.
Right to Purchase Company Common Shares
     In the event that a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of Common Stock (or in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the occurrence of such an event or any other Triggering Event (as defined below), all Rights that are, or (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) were, beneficially owned by any Acquiring Person will be null and void.
Right to Purchase Acquiring Company Shares
     After the Stock Acquisition Date, in the event that (i) the Company consolidates or merges with any other person, and the Company is not the surviving corporation, (ii) any person engages in a share exchange, consolidation or merger with the Company where the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company are exchanged for securities, cash or property of the other person and the Company is the surviving corporation or (iii) 50% or more of the Company's assets or earning power is sold or transferred, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a value equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. The events set forth in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph are referred to as the "."
Triggering Events
Adjustments to Prevent Dilution
     The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities, cash or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to customary adjustments from time to time to prevent dilution in the event of certain changes in the shares of the Company. With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price.
 
Redemption
     In general, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.0001 per Right (subject to adjustment), at any time before to the earlier of (i) the close of business on the day a person becomes an Acquiring Person and (ii) the close of business of the expiration date of the Rights. Immediately upon the action of the Board ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the $0.0001 redemption price.
Exchange Provision
     At any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person (but before such Acquiring Person owns 50% or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock), the Board may exchange the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (other than those owned by an Acquiring Person), for shares of Common Stock, each Right being exchangeable for one share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment.
No Shareholders' Rights Prior to Exercise
     Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
Amendment of the Rights Agreement
     Other than those provisions relating to the principal economic terms of the Rights, any of the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board prior to the earliest of (i) the Distribution Date or (ii) a Triggering Event. After the first to occur of such events, the provisions of the Rights Agreement may be amended without the approval of any holders of Rights Certificates (x) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained in the Rights Agreement which may be defective or inconsistent with the other provision contained therein, or (y) to make any other changes or provisions in regard to matters or questions arising thereunder which the Company may deem necessary or desirable; provided, however, that no such supplement or amendment shall adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights as such (other than an Acquiring Person, or any Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person), and no such supplement or amendment may cause the Rights again to become redeemable at such time as the Rights are not then redeemable or cause the Rights Agreement again to become amendable other than as provided for in the Rights Agreement.
Certain Anti-Takeover Effects
     The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover of the Company and will not do so; however, the Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by the Board and without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers. However, the Rights help ensure that the Company's stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the
 
Company. The execution of the Rights Agreement by the Company is not in response to any specific takeover threat or proposal, but is a precaution taken to protect the rights of the Company's stockholders.
     A copy of the Rights Agreement will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. Once the Rights are issued, a copy of the Rights Agreement will be available to registered holders of the Rights upon written request free of charge from the Rights Agent. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is incorporated herein by reference.

 
Exhibit 99.1
Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG) today announced that its Board of Directors adopted a new stockholder rights plan. The Company's prior rights plan expired on April 1, 2007. The new plan, like the expired plan, is intended to assure that all of the Company's stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to protect stockholders' interests in the event the Company is confronted with partial tender offers or other coercive or unfair takeover tactics.
RADNOR, PA  May 8, 2007 
Pursuant to the new plan, the Board declared a distribution of one right for each share of common stock outstanding on May 25, 2007, the record date. Common stock issued after the record date will be issued with an attached right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one ten-thousandth of a share of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of $230 per share.
Initially, the rights will be attached to the Company's common stock and will not be exercisable. Rights become exercisable only after 10 days following the acquisition by a person or group of 15 percent (or 20 percent in the case of Peter McCausland and certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding common stock, or 10 business days (or a later date if determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with the plan) after the announcement of a tender offer or exchange offer, or an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, to acquire 15 percent (or 20 percent in the case of Peter McCausland and certain of his affiliates) or more of the outstanding common stock.
 
If such a person or group acquires 15 percent or more (or 20 percent or more, as the case may be) of the common stock, then each right not owned by such a person or group will entitle the holder to purchase, at the exercise price, common stock (or in certain circumstances, preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the Company) having a market value equal to twice the exercise price. The rights will have a similar effect if after they become exercisable, the Company merges or effects certain other transactions.
In certain circumstances, the rights may be redeemed by the Company at an initial redemption price of $0.0001 per right. If not redeemed, they will expire on May 8, 2017.
A summary of the rights plan will be provided to Airgas stockholders shortly after the record date.
