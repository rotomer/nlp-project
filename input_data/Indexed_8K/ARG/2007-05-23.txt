Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

The Board of Directors Linde Gas, LLC and Subsidiaries:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Bulk Gas Operations (carved-out operation of Linde Gas, LLC and Subsidiaries) as of December 31, 2005 and the related statements of operations, capital employed, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of Linde Gas, LLC and Subsidiaries management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bulk Gas Operations (carved-out operation of Linde Gas, LLC and Subsidiaries) as of December 31, 2005 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2005 are as follows:
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the schedules reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.

     The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for Airgas, Inc. ("Airgas") gives effect to the purchase, using the purchase method of accounting, of certain operations of the U.S. Linde bulk gas operations ("Bulk Gas Operations") that have been carved-out of the consolidated financial statements of Linde Gas, LLC and Subsidiaries. As such, the cost to acquire the Bulk Gas Operations will be allocated to the respective assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values at the closing of the acquisition. A preliminary allocation of the costs to acquire the Bulk Gas Operations has been made to certain assets and liabilities of the Bulk Gas Operations in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements based on preliminary estimates. Airgas is continuing to assess the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. In addition, the Agreement also provides that for Federal income tax purposes, Linde and Airgas agree on the purchase price allocation within 180 days from March 9, 2007. Accordingly, based on the aforementioned factors, the final allocation may be different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 gives effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on December 31, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 and year ended March 31, 2006 assume the acquisition was effected on April 1, 2005.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using carved-out historical financial statements from the Bulk Gas Operations based on the following periods:
     The pro forma adjustments, and the assumptions on which they are based, are described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only to aid in the analysis of the impact of the acquisition on Airgas. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the combined financial position or results of operations that would have been realized had Airgas and the Bulk Gas Operations been a single entity during the periods presented. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the future results of Airgas. The pro forma does not include benefits associated with anticipated synergies related to combining the businesses as well as integration costs. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of Airgas and the Bulk Gas Operations.
