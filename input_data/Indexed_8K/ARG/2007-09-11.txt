Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On June 30, 2007, pursuant to the Packaged Gas Business Equity Purchase Agreement, dated March 29, 2007 (the "Agreement"), by and among Airgas, Inc. ("Airgas" or the "Company"), Linde Gas Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Linde"), and Linde Aktiengesellschaft, a German corporation (the "Guarantor"), Airgas completed the acquisition of Linde Gas USA LLC (as successor to Linde Gas LLC and subsidiaries) and with it most of the U.S. packaged gas business ("Packaged Gas Operations") of the Guarantor. Airgas paid cash consideration of $310 million. The amount and type of consideration was determined on the basis of arm's length negotiations between Airgas and the Guarantor and is subject to a working capital adjustment. The acquisition was financed through borrowings under Airgas' Twelfth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated July 25, 2006, which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 4 to the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
     The closing of the acquisition was conditioned upon regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The Packaged Gas Operations, excluding certain retained businesses as described below, generated approximately $342 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 and includes 130 locations in 18 states with more than 1,400 employees. The acquired operations include branches, warehouses, packaged gas fill plants, and other operations involved in distributing packaged industrial and specialty gases and related equipment. Most of the acquired operations and personnel will be integrated with eight existing Airgas regional companies, entirely in the eastern U.S.
     The transaction excludes Linde's LifeGas medical gas business, its Spectra Gas rare and specialty gas business, and its Caribbean and Canadian gases business. Also, Linde will retain certain acetylene production and packaged gas fill plants supporting the distributor customer business which had revenues of approximately $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The transaction also would not affect Linde's ongoing merchant liquid, tonnage, pipeline and on-site business in North America and its packaged gas businesses in other parts of the world.
     On May 23, 2007, Airgas amended its Current Report on Form 8-K (Date of Report: March 9, 2007) and provided financial statements and pro forma combined financial information related to the acquisition of certain operations of the U.S. bulk gas operations of the Guarantor ("Bulk Gas Operations") that were carved-out of the consolidated financial statements of Linde Gas LLC. Management concluded that the Bulk Gas Operations and Packaged Gas Operations were related businesses that, in the aggregate, were significant to Airgas. Consequently, the financial statements of the Packaged Gas Operations and pro forma combined financial information are also being filed with the Commission.
     Airgas hereby amends Item 2.01 of its Current Report on Form 8-K (Date of Report: June 30, 2007) related to the Packaged Gas Operations as follows:
     The financial statements and pro forma combined financial information required to be filed pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are included in this Current Report on Form 8-K under Item 9.01.

The Board of Directors Linde Gas USA LLC
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Packaged Gas Operations (carved-out operation of Linde Gas USA LLC, as successor to Linde Gas LLC, and subsidiaries) (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations, capital employed, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of Linde Gas USA LLC and subsidiaries management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Packaged Gas Operations (carved-out operation of Linde Gas USA LLC, as successor to Linde Gas LLC, and subsidiaries) as of December 31, 2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information for Airgas, Inc. ("Airgas" or the "Company") gives effect to the purchase, using the purchase method of accounting, of certain operations of the U.S. Linde packaged gas operations ("Packaged Gas Operations") that have been carved-out of the consolidated financial statements of Linde Gas USA LLC (as successor to Linde Gas, LLC and subsidiaries). As such, the cost to acquire the Packaged Gas Operations has been allocated to the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the closing of the acquisition. A preliminary allocation of the costs to acquire the Packaged Gas Operations was made to the assets and liabilities of the Packaged Gas Operations in the balance sheet as of June 30, 2007 that was filed in Airgas' Form 10-Q dated August 8, 2007. Airgas is continuing to assess the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and such fair values are subject to revision based on actual working capital, a net working capital purchase price adjustment, as defined in the Packaged Gas Business Equity Purchase Agreement dated as of March 29, 2007, by and among Linde Gas Inc. ("Linde"), Linde AG and Airgas (the "Agreement") and as Airgas finalizes appraisals and other analyses. Additionally, in connection with finalizing the Company's plan to exit acquired duplicate facilities and headcount reductions, the Company anticipates recording additional liabilities in purchase accounting. The Agreement also provides that for federal income tax purposes, Linde and Airgas must agree on the purchase price allocation within 180 days from June 30, 2007, unless extended by mutual agreement. Accordingly, based on the aforementioned factors, the final allocation may be different from the amounts reflected in Airgas' consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of earnings for the three months ended June 30, 2007 and year ended March 31, 2007 assume the acquisition was effected on April 1, 2006. As noted in the Form 8-K/A filed May 23, 2007, Airgas completed its acquisition of certain of the U.S. bulk gas business of Linde AG (the "Bulk Gas Operations") and provided pro forma information for the nine months ended December 31, 2006 and the year ended March 31, 2006.
     The unaudited pro forma combined statements of earnings were prepared using carved-out historical financial statements from the Packaged Gas Operations and Bulk Gas Operations based on the following periods:
     The pro forma adjustments, and the assumptions on which they are based, are described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial information.
     The unaudited pro forma combined statements of earnings are presented for illustrative purposes only to aid in the analysis of the impact of the acquisitions on Airgas and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had Airgas and the Packaged Gas Operations and Bulk Gas Operations been a single entity during the periods presented. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined statements of earnings are not necessarily indicative of the future results of Airgas. The pro forma data does not include benefits associated with anticipated synergies related to combining the businesses as well as integration costs. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of earnings and related notes should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of Airgas, the Packaged Gas Operations and the Bulk Gas Operations.
