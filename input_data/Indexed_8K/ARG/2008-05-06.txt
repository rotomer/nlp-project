EXHIBIT 99.1
          
For release:
Immediately
Airgas, Inc. (NYSE: ARG), the largest U.S. distributor of industrial, medical, and specialty gases, welding, safety, and related products, today reported strong growth in sales, operating income, and earnings for its fourth quarter ended March 31, 2008.
RADNOR, PA  May 5, 2008 
Quarterly net earnings grew 47% to $64.2 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to $43.7 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter sales grew 27% from the prior year to $1.1 billion, with acquisitions contributing 19% of the growth. Total same-store sales increased 8% in the quarter, with hardgoods up 4% and gas and rent up 11%.
"Despite a slowing economy, our strategic product categories, which focus on the healthcare, research, environmental, and food and beverage markets, posted 11% organic growth in the quarter," said Airgas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter McCausland. "Our energy and infrastructure construction customers remain strong. Rising export activity and strength in U.S. infrastructure projects are also helping many of our core industrial customers, offsetting the economic slowdown. We continue to grow profitably, as the operating margin in the quarter expanded to 12.1%, an improvement of 120 basis points over last year."
The Company made 18 acquisitions in fiscal 2008, adding more than $500 million in annualized revenue. In addition to the June 30, 2007 acquisition of Linde's U.S. packaged gas business, which added $346 million in annualized revenue from 130 locations across 18 states, there were 17 others that added more than $160 million. "These transactions helped us enhance our core business and extend our product lines, with acquisitions in packaged gases and welding products, safety products, ammonia, and refrigerants," said McCausland. "We have taken time to integrate them in a manner that effectively creates long-term value for our customers and our shareholders."
 
4Q08 Earnings  Exhibit 99.1.doc/Page 2 of 10
Sales in fiscal 2008 increased 25% to $4 billion, with same-store sales growth of 7%. Earnings for the year were $2.66 per diluted share compared to $1.92 per diluted share in the prior year. The current year includes a $0.03 one-time non-cash charge from the National Welders transaction and a $0.01 one-time tax benefit related to a change in state tax law. The prior year included a charge of $0.10 for the early extinguishment of debt and a $0.02 tax benefit related to a change in state tax law. Adjusting for these items, diluted earnings per share increased 34% to $2.68 in fiscal 2008.* The Company generated strong free cash flow of $225 million for the year, compared to $107 million last year.*
McCausland continued, "We expect earnings per diluted share of $3.24 to $3.40 in fiscal 2009. First-quarter expectations are $0.79 to $0.81 per diluted share. We are mindful of the state of the U.S. economy, but we believe Airgas is well-positioned to deliver strong earnings growth this year."

     Reconciliation and computation of adjusted net earnings:
The Company believes this adjusted net earnings computation provides meaningful insight into earnings growth by adjusting for material unusual items. Non-GAAP numbers should be read in conjunction with the generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") financial measures, as non-GAAP metrics are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.

Free Cash Flow:
Reconciliations and computation of free cash flow:
Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors meaningful insight into the Company's ability to generate cash from operations, which is available for servicing debt obligations and for the execution of our business strategy, including acquisitions, the prepayment of debt, or to support other investing and financing activities. Non-GAAP numbers should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures, as non-GAAP metrics are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.
