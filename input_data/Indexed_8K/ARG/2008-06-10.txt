(the "Company") announced the pricing of $400 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes (the "Notes"), as described in the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The proceeds of the Notes will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Company's existing revolving borrowings. The transaction closed June 10, 2008.
     The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.125% per annum and mature on October 1, 2018. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, starting on October 1, 2008, to the holders of record of such Notes at the close of business on March 15 and September 15, respectively, preceding such interest payment date. The Indenture contains covenants that will limit the Company's ability and, in certain instances, the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries to (i) borrow money or sell preferred stock; (ii) create liens; (iii) pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock; (iv) make certain types of investments; (v) sell stock in our restricted subsidiaries; (vi) create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii) issue guarantees of debt, and (ix) sell assets or merge with other companies.

     At any time on or prior to October 1, 2011, Airgas may at its option on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.125% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the redemption date. At any time prior to October 1, 2013, Airgas may also redeem all or a part of the notes, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, thereon and a make-whole premium equal to the greater of (1) 1% of the principal amount of the note and (2) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the note at October 1, 2013 plus (ii) all required interest payments due on the note through October 1, 2013 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points over (y) the principal amount of the note, if greater.
     The indenture provides for customary events of default, including: nonpayment, breach of the covenants in the indenture, payment defaults or acceleration of other indebtedness, a failure to pay certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If any event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately, together with interest, if any, accrued thereon.
 
     Under the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed to register notes having substantially identical terms as the Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of an offer to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for the Notes.

The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date, that no such special record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest.

     (b) the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Notes; that no Additional Notes may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Notes to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code; and
provided
     (c) whether such Additional Notes shall be transfer restricted notes and issued in the form of Initial Notes as set forth in Section 2.02 this Indenture or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Notes.

Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in integral multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed. No Note may be redeemed in part if such redemption would result in its face value being less than $2,000. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Notes or portions of Notes to be redeemed.

If a Note is redeemed on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note was
 
registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.

Rights of Trustee.

          (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

          (f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.
          (g) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
          (h) In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but no limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.
          (i) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.
 
               Section 7.03.
Individual Rights of Trustee.
          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11 hereof.
               Section 7.04.
Trustee's Disclaimer.
          The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Company or upon the Company's direction under any provision of this Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.
               Section 7.05.
Notice of Defaults.
          If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and (a) if it is actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or (b) unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of Notes a notice of the Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Notes.
               Section 7.06.
Reports by Trustee to Holders of the Notes.
          Within 60 days after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, and for so long as Notes remain outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA  313(a) (but if no event described in TIA  313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all reports as required by TIA  313(c).
          A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Notes shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the Commission and each stock exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA  313(d). The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange or delisted therefrom.
               Section 7.07.
Compensation and Indemnity.
          Each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Trustee as agreed upon from time to time in writing reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for
 
its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.
          Each of the Company and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall fully indemnify the Trustee against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses incurred by it, without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense has been caused by its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim of which it has received notice for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall reasonably cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith.
          The obligations of the Company under this Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.
          To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
          When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(g) or (h) hereof occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
          The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA  313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.
               Section 7.08.
Replacement of Trustee.
          A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section.
          The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company may remove the Trustee if:
     (a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;
     (b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
     (c) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
 
     (d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.
          If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.
          If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company, or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
          A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.07 hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Company's obligations under Section 7.07 hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

               Section 8.01.
Option To Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
          The Company may, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers' Certificate, at any time, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article 8. If the Company exercises its option under this Section 8.01 with respect to either Section 8.02 or 8.03, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee.
               Section 8.02.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
          Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.02, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all outstanding Notes on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, ""). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section 4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article 8.

Covenant Defeasance.
          Upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Company shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from its obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18 and 4.19 hereof and clause (iv) of Section 5.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, ""), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise under Section 8.01
Covenant Defeasance
 
hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(c) through 6.01(f) hereof shall not constitute Events of Default.

     (e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;
     (f) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders over any other creditors of the Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors of the Company; and

          Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the request of the Company any money or non-callable Government Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
               Section 8.06.
Repayment to Company.
          Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on its request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall thereafter look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; that, if the Company makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
provided

Without Consent of Holders of Notes.
          Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes without the consent of any Holder of a Note:
     (a) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to make a modification of a formal, minor or technical nature or to correct a manifest error;
     (b) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes or to alter the provisions of Article 2 hereof (including the related definitions) in a manner that does not materially adversely affect any Holder;
     (c) to comply with Section 5.01 hereof;
     (d) to provide for the assumption of the Company's or a Guarantor's obligations to the Holders of the Notes by a successor to the Company pursuant to Article 5 or hereof;
     (e) to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes or to secure the Notes;
     (f) to add to the covenants of the Company or any Guarantor for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Company or any Guarantor;
     (g) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights hereunder of any Holder of the Note;
     (h) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;
     (i) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under this Indenture of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements hereof; or
     (j) to provide for the issuance of exchange or private exchange notes.
          However, no amendment may be made to Article 10 of this Indenture or the conditions precedent to Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance set forth in clause (e) of Section 8.04 hereof, in each case, that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt of the Company or a Guarantor then outstanding unless the holders of such Senior Debt (or their representative) consent to such change.
 
          Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
               Section 9.02.
With Consent of Holders of Notes.
          Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture (including Section 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof), the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Notes with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Without the consent of at least 75% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, such Notes), no waiver or amendment to this Indenture may make any change in the provisions of Article 10 hereof that adversely affects the rights of any Holder of Notes. Section 2.08 hereof shall determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 9.02.
          Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a resolution of its Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
          It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
          After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
 
     (a) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
     (b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter or waive any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes;
     (c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any Note;
     (d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or interest or premium, or Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including Additional Notes, if any) and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
     (e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;
     (f) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium or Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes;
     (g) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note;
     (h) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee or this Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; or
     (i) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.
               Section 9.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
          Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in a amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.

Revocation and Effect of Consents.
          Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
               Section 9.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
          The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
 
          Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
               Section 9.06. .
Trustee To Sign Amendments, etc
          The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until the Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall be provided with and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and and Officer's Certificate each stating that the supplemental Indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture in addition to the documents required by Section 13.04 hereof.
               Section 10.01. .
Agreement To Subordinate
          The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Note agrees, that the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article 10, to the prior payment in full in cash or Cash Equivalents of all Senior Debt (whether outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed), and that the subordination is for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt.
               Section 10.02. .
Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy
          Upon any distribution to creditors of the Company in a liquidation or dissolution of the Company or in a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the Company's assets and liabilities:
      (i) holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior Debt (including interest after the commencement of any such proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Debt) before Holders of the Notes shall be entitled to receive any payment with respect to the Notes (except that Holders may receive (A) Permitted Junior Securities and (B) payments and other distributions made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof); and
      (ii) until all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt (as provided in clause (i) above) are paid in full, any distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article 10 shall be made to holders of Senior Debt (except that Holders of Notes may receive (A) Permitted Junior Securities and (B) payments and other distributions made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof), as their interests may appear.
               Section 10.03. .
Default on Designated Senior Debt
          (a) The Company may not make any payment or distribution to the Trustee or any Holder in respect of Obligations with respect to the Notes and may not acquire from the Trustee or any Holder any Notes for cash or property (other than (A) Permitted Junior Securities and (B) payments and
 
other distributions made from any defeasance trust created pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof) until all principal and other Obligations with respect to the Senior Debt have been paid in full if:
      (i) a default in the payment of any principal (including reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit) of, premium, if any, or interest on or commitment, letter of credit or administrative fees relating to, Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing beyond any applicable period of grace; or
      (ii) a default, other than a payment default, on any series of Designated Senior Debt occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of the Designated Senior Debt to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of the default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from the holders of any such Designated Senior Debt or their representative. If the Trustee receives any such Payment Blockage Notice, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until (A) at least 360 days shall have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice and (B) all scheduled payments of principal, interest and premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, on the Notes that have come due have been paid in full in cash. No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice unless such default shall have been cured or waived for a period of not less than 180 days.
          (b) The Company shall resume payments on and distributions in respect of the Notes and may acquire them upon the earlier of:
       (i) in the case of a default referred to in clause (i) of Section 10.03(a) hereof, the date upon which the default is cured or waived, or
       (ii) in the case of a default referred to in clause (ii) of Section 10.03(a) hereof, upon the earlier of the date on which such non-payment default is cured or waived or 179 days pass after the date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received, unless the maturity of such Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated,
if this Article 10 otherwise permits the payment, distribution or acquisition at the time of such payment or acquisition.
               Section 10.04.
Acceleration of Notes.
          If payment of the Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify holders of Senior Debt of the acceleration.
               Section 10.05.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over.
          In the event that the Trustee or any Holder receives any payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes at a time when the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, has actual knowledge that such payment is prohibited by Section 10.03 hereof, such payment shall be held by the Trustee or such Holder, in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid forthwith over and delivered, upon written request, to, the holders of Senior Debt as their interests may appear or their Representative under the indenture or other agreement (if any) pursuant to which Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of all Obligations with respect to Senior Debt remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Obligations in full in accordance with their terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Debt.
 
          With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes to perform only such obligations on the part of the Trustee as are specifically set forth in this Article 10, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt, and shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall pay over or distribute to or on behalf of Holders or the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10, except if such payment is made as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the Trustee.
               Section 10.06.
Notice by Company.
          The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Paying Agent of any facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice shall not affect the subordination of the Notes to the Senior Debt as provided in this Article 10.
               Section 10.07.
Subrogation.
          After all Senior Debt is paid in full and until the Notes are paid in full, Holders of Notes shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with all other Indebtedness pari passu with the Notes) to the rights of holders of Senior Debt to receive distributions applicable to Senior Debt to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders of Notes have been applied to the payment of Senior Debt. A distribution made under this Article 10 to holders of Senior Debt that otherwise would have been made to Holders of Notes is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on the Notes.
               Section 10.08.
Relative Rights.
          This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Holders of Notes and holders of Senior Debt. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
     (i) impair, as between the Company and Holders of Notes, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Notes in accordance with their terms;
     (ii) affect the relative rights of Holders of Notes and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Debt; or
     (iii) prevent the Trustee or any Holder of Notes from exercising its available remedies upon a Default or Event of Default, subject to the rights of holders and owners of Senior Debt to receive distributions and payments otherwise payable to Holders of Notes.
          If the Company fails because of this Article 10 to pay principal of or interest on a Note on the due date, the failure is still a Default or Event of Default.
               Section 10.09.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company.
          No right of any holder of Senior Debt to enforce the subordination of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or any Holder or by the failure of the Company or any Holder to comply with this Indenture.
 
               Section 10.10.
Distribution or Notice to Representative.
          Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Debt, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative.
          Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such Representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders of Notes for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.
               Section 10.11.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent.
          Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee and the Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Notes, unless the Trustee shall have received at its Corporate Trust Office at least five Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Obligations with respect to the Notes to violate this Article 10. Nothing in this Article 10 shall impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof.
          The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Debt with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent may do the same with like rights.
               Section 10.12.
Authorization To Effect Subordination.
          Each Holder of Notes, by the Holder's acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 6.09 hereof at least 30 days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the Representatives are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.
               Section 10.13.
Amendments.
          The provisions of this Article 10 shall not be amended or modified in a manner that adversely affects the rights of any holder of Senior Debt without the written consent of the holder of such Senior Debt (or their representative).
               Section 10.14.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
          The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of the Notes or to the Company or to any other person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article 10 or otherwise. With respect to such holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants or obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article 10 and no implied
 
covenants or obligations with respect to holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.
     Section 10.15. .
Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent
          Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, Custodian, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article.
     Section 11.01. .
Guarantee
          Subject to this Article 11, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
          Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture.
          If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
 
          Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
     Section 11.02. .
Subordination of Subsidiary Guarantee
          The Obligations of each Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to this Article 11 shall be junior and subordinated to the Senior Debt of such Guarantor on the same basis as the Notes are junior and subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company as set forth in Article 10 hereof. Each Subsidiary Guarantee is made subject to the provisions of Article 10 hereof. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Trustee and the Holders shall have the right to receive and/or retain payments by any of the Guarantors only at such times as they may receive and/or retain payments in respect of the Notes pursuant to this Indenture, including Article 10 hereof.
     Section 11.03. .
Limitation on Guarantor Liability
          Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 11, result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
     Section 11.04. .
Execution and Delivery of Subsidiary Guarantee
          To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form included in Exhibit D shall be endorsed by an Officer of such Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Guarantor by its President or one of its Vice Presidents.
          Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Subsidiary a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
          If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
 
          The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Guarantors.
          In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Indenture, if required by Section 4.16 hereof, the Company shall cause such Domestic Restricted Subsidiaries to execute supplemental indentures to this Indenture and Subsidiary Guarantees in accordance with Section 4.16 hereof and this Article 11, to the extent applicable.
     Section 11.05. .
Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
          Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.06, no Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person whether or not affiliated with such Guarantor unless:
     (a) subject to Section 11.06 hereof, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than a Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, under the Notes, this Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein; and
     (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.
          In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
          Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 hereof, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
     Section 11.06. .
Release of Guarantors
          The Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released and the Guarantor relieved of any Obligations under its Guarantee:
     (1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if the sale or other disposition complies with Section 4.10 hereof;
 
     (2) in connection with any sale of all of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of Airgas, if the sale complies with Section 4.10 hereof;
     (3) upon the Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of the Notes in accordance with the terms of Article 8 hereof;
     (4) if the Company designates such Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the indenture; or
     (5) upon the release of such Guarantor from its Guarantee of the obligations under the Credit Agreement.
     Section 12.01. .
Satisfaction and Discharge
          This Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued hereunder, when:
          (1) either:
     (a) all Notes that have been authenticated (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
     (b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium and Liquidated Damages, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;
     (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Guarantor is bound;
     (3) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under this Indenture; and
     (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under this Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.
 
          In addition, the Company must deliver an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.
          Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (b) of clause (1) of this Section, the provisions of Section 12.02 and Section 8.06 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge.
     Section 12.02. .
Application of Trust Money
          Subject to the provisions of Section 8.06, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 12.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
          If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or Government Securities in accordance with Section 12.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's and any Guarantor's obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.01; that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money or Government Securities held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this "Supplemental Indenture"), dated as of                     , among                      (the "Guaranteeing Subsidiary"), a subsidiary of Airgas, Inc. (or its permitted successor), a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), the Company, the other Guarantors (as defined in the Indenture referred to herein) and The Bank of New York, as trustee under the indenture referred to below (the "Trustee").
     WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore executed and delivered to the Trustee an indenture (the "Indenture"), dated as of June 10, 2008, providing for the issuance of 7.125% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "Notes");
     WHEREAS, the Indenture provides that under certain circumstances the Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to which the Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall unconditionally guarantee all of the Company's Obligations under the Notes and the Indenture on the terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Subsidiary Guarantee"); and
     WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Indenture, the Trustee is authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.
     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as follows:
     1. CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     2. AGREEMENT TO GUARANTEE. The Guaranteeing Subsidiary hereby agrees as follows:
     (a) Along with all Guarantors named in the Indenture, to jointly and severally Guarantee to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that:
     (i) the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and
     (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed
 
or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately.
     (b) The obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Notes or the Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Notes with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.
     (c) The following is hereby waived: diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever.
     (d) This Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and the Indenture, and the Guaranteeing Subsidiary accepts all obligations of a Guarantor under the Indenture.
     (e) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors, or any Custodian, Trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
     (f) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.
     (g) As between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 of the Indenture, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee.
     (h) The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee.
     (i) Pursuant to Section 10.02 of the Indenture, after giving effect to any maximum amount and any other contingent and fixed liabilities that are relevant under any applicable Bankruptcy or fraudulent conveyance laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under Article 10 of the Indenture, this new Subsidiary Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount permissible such that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsidiary Guarantee will not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
 
     3. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY. Each Guaranteeing Subsidiary agrees that the Subsidiary Guarantees shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
     4. GUARANTEEING SUBSIDIARY MAY CONSOLIDATE, ETC. ON CERTAIN TERMS.
     (a) The Guaranteeing Subsidiary may not consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another corporation, Person or entity whether or not affiliated with such Guarantor unless:
     (i) subject to Sections 11.04 and 11.05 of the Indenture, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than a Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein; and
     (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.
     (b) In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Subsidiary Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of the Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor corporation thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under the Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of the Indenture as though all of such Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
     (c) Except as set forth in Articles 4 and 5 and Section 11.05 of Article 11 of the Indenture, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in the Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or another Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.
     5. RELEASES.
     (a) In the event of a sale or other disposition of all of the assets of any Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all to the capital stock of any Guarantor, in each case to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, then such Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all of the capital stock of such Guarantor) or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor) will be released and relieved of any obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee; that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10 of the Indenture. Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the provisions of the
provided
 
Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10 of the Indenture, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee.
     (b) Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under the Indenture as provided in Article 11 of the Indenture.
     6. NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, stockholder or agent of the Guaranteeing Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any Guaranteeing Subsidiary under the Notes, any Subsidiary Guarantees, the Indenture or this Supplemental Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.
     7. NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY.
     8. COUNTERPARTS. The parties may sign any number of copies of this Supplemental Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together represent the same agreement.
     9. EFFECT OF HEADINGS. The Section headings herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
     10. THE TRUSTEE. The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which recitals are made solely by the Guaranteeing Subsidiary and the Company.
 
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed, all as of the date first above written.

     (a) If (i) the Company is not required to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or to consummate the Exchange Offer solely because the Exchange Offer is not permitted by applicable law or Commission policy (after the procedures set forth in Section 6(a) hereof have been complied with), (ii) for any reason the Exchange Offer is not Consummated by the Exchange Date and the Securities are not all Freely Tradable prior to such time, or (iii) prior to the Exchange Date: (A) the Initial Purchasers request from the Company with respect to Transfer Restricted Securities not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Exchange Offer, (B) with respect to any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities such Holder notifies the Company that (i) such Holder is prohibited by applicable law or Commission policy from participating in the Exchange Offer, (ii) such Holder may not resell the Exchange Securities acquired by it in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus and that the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not appropriate or available for such resales by such Holder, or (iii) such Holder is a Broker-Dealer and holds Transfer

Restricted Securities acquired directly from the Company or one of its affiliates or (C) in the case of any Initial Purchaser, such Initial Purchaser notifies the Company it will not receive Freely Tradable Exchange Securities in exchange for Transfer Restricted Securities constituting any portion of such Initial Purchaser's unsold allotment, the Company and the Guarantors shall
     (x) cause to be filed a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, which may be an amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (in either event, the "Shelf Registration Statement") as promptly as practicable after the date such obligation arises but no earlier than the 365th day after the Closing Date (or if such 365th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) (such date being the "Shelf Filing Deadline"), which Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities the Holders of which shall have provided the information required pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof; and
     (y) use their reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or before the 30th day after the Shelf Filing Deadline (or if such 30th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).
     Each of the Company and the Guarantors shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders of such Securities entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a), and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, from the date on which the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission until the earlier of the first anniversary of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement and the date all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have either been sold as contemplated in the Shelf Registration Statement or become Freely Tradable.

     (b) No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, within 20 Business Days after receipt of a request therefor, such information as the Company may reasonably request for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein. Each Holder as to which any Shelf Registration Statement is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.

Additional Interest.
 
Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective but ceases to be effective at any time at which it is required to be effective under this Agreement (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), a "Registration Default"), the Company hereby agrees that the interest rate borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities shall be increased by 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of any Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period (such increase, "Additional Interest"), but in no event shall such increase exceed 1.00% per annum. At the earlier of (i) the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to the particular Transfer Restricted Securities or (ii) the particular Transfer Restricted Securities having become Freely Tradable, the interest rate borne by the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate borne by such Transfer Restricted Securities; that, if after any such reduction in interest rate due to the cure of a Registration Default, a different Registration Default occurs, the interest rate borne by the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities shall again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions.
provided, however,
     All obligations of the Company and the Guarantors set forth in the preceding paragraph that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security shall have been satisfied in full.

any Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any action effected with the written consent of the Company and the Guarantors. The Company and the Guarantors shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding.
     (b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantors and their respective directors, officers of the Company and the Guarantors who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company or any of the Guarantors, and the respective officers, directors, partners and employees of each such Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantors to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company and the Guarantors, and the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors and officers and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
     (c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Company and the Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company and the Guarantors from the Initial Placement), the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments actions or expenses, and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent,
 
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
     The Company, the Guarantors and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
          SECTION 9. Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding, to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
Rule 144A.
          SECTION 10. No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holder's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
Participation in Underwritten Registrations.
          SECTION 11.The Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten Offering; provided, that the Company shall only be obligated to effect such Underwritten Offering if so directed by the Holders of at least 20% of the Transfer Restricted Securities then outstanding. In any such Underwritten Offering,
Selection of Underwriters.
 
the investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) that will administer such offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities included in such offering; , that such investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) must be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
provided, however
SECTION 12.
Miscellaneous.
     (a) Each of the Company and the Guarantors hereby agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies.
     (b) Each of the Company and the Guarantors will not on or after the date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Company's or any of the Guarantors' securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements.
     (c) The Company will not take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to the Securities that would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Holders to Consummate any Exchange Offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities being tendered or registered; that, with respect to any matter that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser with respect to which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver, consent or departure is to be effective.
