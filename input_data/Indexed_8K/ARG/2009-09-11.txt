On September 11, 2009, Airgas, Inc. (the Company) announced it has elected to redeem all of its $150 million 6.25% Senior Subordinated Notes (the Notes) that are due July 15, 2014.

A loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately $6 million (about $4 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) will be recognized related to the redemption premium and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.  The loss will be reflected in the fiscal third quarter ending December 31, 2009.
The election to exercise the redemption provision of the Notes accelerates the maturity date of the Notes to the redemption date.  The Company will finance the redemption of the Notes with borrowings under its revolving credit facility.  Under existing covenant restrictions, the Companys liquidity will not be significantly affected by the redemption of the Notes.  
The Companys press release announcing the redemption of the Notes is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
