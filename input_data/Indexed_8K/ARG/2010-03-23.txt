On March 17, 2010, Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Third Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement among the Company, as servicer, Radnor Funding Corp., a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "SPE"), the various purchaser groups (which consist of bank conduits, their related committed purchasers and their related agents) from time to time party thereto (the "Purchasers") and the Administrator party thereto (the "Receivables Purchase Agreement"). The Receivables Purchase Agreement amended and restated a previous agreement which was set to expire on March 17, 2010. The Company is also party to an Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Sale Agreement"), dated as of December 19, 2002, among the Company, the SPE and certain of the Company's other subsidiaries (the "Originators").
Under the Sale Agreement, the Originators sell trade receivables to the SPE, which, pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, transfers an undivided interest in qualifying trade receivables to the bank conduits. The Company does not provide any financial guarantees of the bank conduits' obligations. The agents for the bank conduits currently consist of three commercial banks rated double-A or higher.
The maximum availability under the Receivables Purchase Agreement is $295 million. Availability is further subject to customer concentration levels and certain other characteristics of the receivables being transferred. The Receivables Purchase Agreement initially covers all receivables sold and outstanding under the previous agreement. As of March 17, 2010, the full $295 million of availability was used to cover these receivables.
The Receivables Purchase Agreement provides the Company (through the SPE) with funding at a cost that is 95 basis points above the bank conduits' costs of issuing A1/P1 commercial paper. The Company's marginal cost of funding under the Receivables Purchase Agreement is 65 basis points higher than the previous agreement. Under the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the SPE is obligated to pay commitment fees and other customary fees to the Purchasers.
Pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the Company continues to service, administer and collect the trade receivables on behalf of the bank conduits. The servicing fees charged to the bank conduits approximate the costs of collections.
The Receivables Purchase Agreement contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains customary default and termination provisions, which provide for acceleration of amounts owed under the Receivables Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including, but not limited to, failure by the SPE to pay any amounts due, defaults on certain indebtedness, certain judgments, change in control, certain events negatively affecting the overall credit quality of transferred receivables and bankruptcy and insolvency events.
The foregoing description of the Receivables Purchase Agreement is qualified by reference in its entirety to a copy of the Receivables Purchase Agreement, which is filed herewith as an exhibit and incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.
 
The information set forth in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

4. The Seller owns and has good and marketable title to the Receivables free and clear of any Adverse Claim, excepting only liens for taxes, assessments or similar governmental charges or levies incurred in the ordinary course of business that are not yet due and payable or as to which any applicable grace period shall not have expired, or that are being contested in good faith by proper proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established, but only so long as foreclosure with respect to such a lien is not imminent and the use and value of the property to which the lien attaches is not impaired during the pendency of such proceeding.
5. The Seller has caused or will have caused, within ten days after the effective date of the Agreement, the filing of all appropriate financing statements in the proper filing office in the appropriate jurisdictions under applicable law in order to perfect the sale of the Receivables from the Originators to the Seller, and the security interest in the Receivables granted to the Administrator under the Agreement.

security interest in the Pool Assets as a first priority interest (each a "Filing").
