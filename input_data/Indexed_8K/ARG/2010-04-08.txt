Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
                Effective as of April 7, 2010, the Board of Directors of Airgas, Inc. (the "Company") amended the first sentence of Article II, Section 1 of the Company's By-Laws to read in its entirety as follows: "Each annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of Directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting  shall be held on such date as the Board of Directors shall fix."  This amendment eliminates a requirement that the annual meeting be held within five months of the end of the fiscal year of the Company.  The Company expects to hold its next annual meeting of stockholders on or before September 17, 2010. 
                The foregoing description of the Company's bylaws is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amended and restated bylaws of the Company attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
