Each Borrower consents to any such increases or decreases and acknowledges that decreasing the Advance Rates or increasing the reserves may limit or restrict Advances requested by Borrowing Agent. Agent shall give Borrowing Agent fifteen (15) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to decrease the Advance Rates. 2.2 Procedure for Borrowing Advances. (a) Borrowing Agent on behalf of any Borrower may notify Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) on a Business Day of a Borrower's request to incur, on that day, a Revolving Advance hereunder. Should any amount required to be paid as interest hereunder, or as fees or other charges under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders, or with respect to any other Obligation, become due, same shall be deemed a request for a Revolving Advance as of the date such payment is due, in the amount required to 23
pay in full such interest, fee, charge or Obligation under this Agreement or any other agreement with Agent or Lenders, and such request shall be irrevocable. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) above, in the event any Borrower desires to obtain a Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent in writing no later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) at least three (3) Business Days' prior to the date of such proposed borrowing, specifying (i) the date of the proposed borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (ii) the type of borrowing and the amount of such Revolving Advance to be borrowed, which amount shall be in a minimum amount of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) and in integral multiples of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) thereafter, and (iii) the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. Interest Periods for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be for one (1), two (2), three (3) or six (6) months; provided, if an Interest Period would end on a day that is not a Business Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month in which case the Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day. No Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made available to Borrower during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default. (c) Each Interest Period of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall commence on the date such Eurodollar Rate Loan is made and shall end on such date as Borrowing Agent may elect as set forth in subsection (b)(iii) above provided that the exact length of each Interest Period shall be determined in accordance with the practice of the interbank market for offshore Dollar deposits and no Interest Period shall end after the last day of the Term. The Borrowing Agent shall elect the initial Interest Period applicable to a Eurodollar Rate Loan by its notice of borrowing given to Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or by its notice of conversion given to Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(d), as the case may be. Borrowing Agent shall elect the duration of each succeeding Interest Period by giving irrevocable written notice to Agent of such duration not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If Agent does not receive timely notice of the Interest Period elected by Borrowing Agent, Borrowers shall be deemed to have elected to convert to a Domestic Rate Loan subject to Section 2.2(d) hereinbelow. (d) Provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any Borrower may, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to any outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, or on any Business Day with respect to Domestic Rate Loans, convert any such loan into a loan of another type in the same aggregate principal amount provided that any conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If a Borrower desires to convert a loan, Borrowing Agent shall give Agent not less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to convert from a Domestic Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Rate Loan or one (1) Business Day's prior written notice to convert from a Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Domestic Rate Loan, specifying the date of such conversion, the loans to be converted and if the conversion is from a Domestic Rate Loan to any other type of loan, the duration of the first Interest Period therefor. After giving effect to each such conversion, there shall not be outstanding more than five (5) Eurodollar Rate Loans, in the aggregate. 24
(e) At its option and upon three (3) Business Days' prior written notice, any Borrower may prepay the Eurodollar Rate Loans in whole at any time or in part from time to time, without premium or penalty, but with accrued interest on the principal being prepaid to the date of such repayment. Such Borrower shall specify the date of prepayment of Advances which are Eurodollar Rate Loans and the amount of such prepayment. In the event that any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan is required or permitted on a date other than the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, such Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(f) hereof. (f) Each Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders and hold Agent and Lenders harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses that Agent and Lenders may sustain or incur as a consequence of any prepayment, conversion of or any default by any Borrower in the payment of the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Rate Loan or failure by any Borrower to complete a borrowing of, a prepayment of or conversion of or to a Eurodollar Rate Loan after notice thereof has been given, including, but not limited to, any interest payable by Agent or Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. (g) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if any applicable law, treaty, regulation or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender (for purposes of this subsection (g), the term "Lender" shall include any Lender and the office or branch where any Lender or any corporation or bank controlling such Lender makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans) to make or maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans, the obligation of Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Loans hereunder shall forthwith be cancelled and Borrowers shall, if any affected Eurodollar Rate Loans are then outstanding, promptly upon request from Agent, either pay all such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or convert such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans into loans of another type. If any such payment or conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan is made on a day that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, Borrowers shall pay Agent, upon Agent's request, such amount or amounts as may be necessary to compensate Lenders for any loss or expense sustained or incurred by Lenders in respect of such Eurodollar Rate Loan as a result of such payment or conversion, including (but not limited to) any interest or other amounts payable by Lenders to lenders of funds obtained by Lenders in order to make or maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence submitted by Lenders to Borrowing Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 2.3 Disbursement of Advance Proceeds. All Advances shall be disbursed from whichever office or other place Agent may designate from time to time and, together with any and all other Obligations of Borrowers to Agent or Lenders, shall be charged to Borrowers' Account on Agent's books. During the Term, Borrowers may use the Revolving Advances by borrowing, prepaying and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The proceeds of each Revolving Advance requested by Borrowers or deemed to have been requested by Borrowers under Section 2.2(a) 25
hereof shall, with respect to requested Revolving Advances to the extent Lenders make such Revolving Advances, be made available to the applicable Borrower on the day so requested by way of credit to such Borrower's operating account at PNC, or such other bank as Borrowing Agent may designate following notification to Agent, in immediately available federal funds or other immediately available funds or, with respect to Revolving Advances deemed to have been requested by any Borrower, be disbursed to Agent to be applied to the outstanding Obligations giving rise to such deemed request. 2.4 Maximum Advances. The aggregate balance of outstanding Revolving Advances and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (b) the Formula Amount. 2.5 Repayment of Advances. (a) The Revolving Advances shall be due and payable in full on the last day of the Term subject to earlier prepayment as herein provided. (b) To the extent that Collateral of the Borrowers is required to be deposited into Blocked Accounts or Depository Accounts pursuant to Section 4.15(h) hereof, each Borrower recognizes that the amounts evidenced by checks, notes, drafts or any other items of payment relating to and/or proceeds of Collateral may not be collectible by Agent on the date received. In consideration of Agent's agreement to conditionally credit Borrowers' Account as of the Business Day on which Agent receives those items of payment, each Borrower agrees that, in computing the charges under this Agreement, all items of payment shall be deemed applied by Agent on account of the Obligations one (1) Business Day after the Business Day Agent receives such payments via wire transfer or electronic depository check. Agent is not, however, required to credit Borrowers' Account for the amount of any item of payment which is unsatisfactory to Agent and Agent may charge Borrowers' Account for the amount of any item of payment which is returned to Agent unpaid. (c) All payments of principal, interest and other amounts payable hereunder, or under any of the Other Documents shall be made to Agent at the Payment Office not later than 1:00 P.M. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) on the due date therefor in lawful money of the United States of America in federal funds or other funds immediately available to Agent. Agent shall have the right to effectuate payment on any and all Obligations due and owing hereunder by charging Borrowers' Account or by making Advances as provided in Section 2.2 hereof. (d) Borrowers shall pay principal, interest, and all other amounts payable hereunder, or under any related agreement, without any deduction whatsoever, including, but not limited to, any deduction for any setoff or counterclaim. 2.6 Repayment of Excess Advances. The aggregate balance of outstanding Revolving Advances and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding at any time in excess of the maximum 26
amount of such Advances permitted hereunder shall be immediately due and payable without the necessity of any demand, at the Payment Office, whether or not a Default or Event of Default has occurred. 2.7 Statement of Account. Agent shall maintain, in accordance with its customary procedures, a loan account ("Borrowers' Account") in the name of Borrowers in which shall be recorded the date and amount of each Advance made by Agent and the date and amount of each payment in respect thereof; provided, however, the failure by Agent to record the date and amount of any Advance shall not adversely affect Agent or any Lender. Each month, Agent shall send to Borrowing Agent a statement showing the accounting for the Advances made, payments made or credited in respect thereof, and other transactions between Agent and Borrowers (and, with respect to Letters of Credit only, ATI) during such month. The monthly statements shall be deemed correct and binding upon Borrowers in the absence of demonstrable error and shall constitute an account stated between Lenders and Borrowers unless Agent receives a written statement of Borrowers' specific exceptions thereto within thirty (30) days after such statement is received by Borrowing Agent. The records of Agent with respect to the loan account shall be conclusive evidence absent demonstrable error of the amounts of Advances (including the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding, as applicable) and other charges thereto and of payments applicable thereto. 2.8 Letters of Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Agent shall (a) issue or cause the issuance of Letters of Credit ("Letters of Credit") on behalf of any Borrower or ATI; provided, however, that Agent will not be required to issue or cause to be issued any Letters of Credit to the extent that the face Dollar Equivalent amount of such Letters of Credit would then cause the sum of (i) the outstanding Revolving Advances plus (ii) the outstanding Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit to exceed the lesser of (x) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (y) the Formula Amount. The maximum amount of the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding shall not exceed One Hundred Fifty Million and 00/100 Dollars ($150,000,000.00) in the aggregate at any time. All disbursements or payments related to Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Domestic Rate Loans (in Dollars) consisting of Revolving Advances and shall bear interest at the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic Rate Loans; Letters of Credit that have not been drawn upon shall not bear interest. 2.9 Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) Borrowing Agent, on behalf of any Borrower or ATI, may request Agent to issue or cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit by delivering to Agent at the Payment Office, Agent's form of Letter of Credit Application (the "Letter of Credit Application") completed to the satisfaction of Agent; and, such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as Agent may reasonably request no later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) at least five (5) Business Days' prior to the date of such proposed issuance. Borrowing Agent, on behalf of Borrowers and ATI, also has the right to give instructions and make agreements with respect to any application, any applicable letter of credit and security 27
agreement, any applicable letter of credit reimbursement agreement and/or any other applicable agreement, any letter of credit and the disposition of documents, disposition of any unutilized funds, and to agree with Agent upon any amendment, extension or renewal of any Letter of Credit.

Each trade letter of credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500, and any amendments or revisions thereof adhered to by the Issuer (the "UCP"). Each standby Letter of Credit shall be subject to the International Standby Practices 1998, International Chamber of Commerce Publication 590 and any amendments or revisions thereof adhered to by the Issuer (the "ISP") or the UCP, as determined by the Issuer. Each Letter of Credit shall be governed, to the extent not inconsistent with the UCP or the ISP, as applicable, by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (provided, however, upon the request of the Borrowing Agent and the consent of the Issuer, a Letter of Credit may be governed by the laws of a state other than Pennsylvania). (c) Agent shall notify Lenders of the request by Borrowing Agent for a Letter of Credit hereunder within a reasonable time after receiving such request. (d) Agent shall have absolute discretion whether to accept any draft. Without in any way limiting Agent's absolute discretion whether to accept any draft, Borrowing Agent will not present for acceptance any draft, and Agent will generally not accept any drafts (i) that arise out of transactions involving the sale of goods by any Borrower or ATI not in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) that involve a sale to an Affiliate of any Borrower or ATI, (iii) that involve any purchase for which Agent has not received all related documents, instruments and forms requested by Agent, or (iv) that is not eligible for discounting with Federal Reserve Banks pursuant to paragraph 7 of Section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. 2.10 Requirements For Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) In connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit, Borrowers and ATI shall indemnify, save and hold Agent, each Lender and each Issuer harmless from any loss, cost, expense or liability, including, without limitation, payments made by Agent, any Lender or any Issuer and expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Agent, any Lender or Issuer arising out of, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit to be issued or created for any Borrower or ATI. Borrowers and ATI shall be bound by Agent's or any Issuer's regulations and good faith interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued or created for Borrowers' Account, although this interpretation may be different from its own; and, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any Issuer nor any of their correspondents shall be liable for any error, negligence, or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following Borrowing Agent's or any Borrower's or ATI's instructions or those contained in any Letter of Credit or of any 28
modifications, amendments or supplements thereto or in issuing or paying any Letter of Credit, except for Agent's, any Lender's, any Issuer's or such correspondents' gross negligence or willful misconduct. (b) Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct any Issuer to name the applicable Borrower or ATI as the "Applicant" or "Account Party" of each Letter of Credit. If Agent is not the Issuer of any Letter of Credit, Borrowing Agent shall authorize and direct the Issuer to deliver to Agent all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by the Issuer pursuant to the Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon Agent's instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit, the application therefor or any acceptance therefor. (c) In connection with all Letters of Credit issued or caused to be issued by Agent under this Agreement, each Borrower and ATI hereby appoints Agent, or its designee, as its attorney, with full power and authority upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Default, (i) to sign and/or endorse such Borrower's or ATI's name upon any warehouse or other receipts, letter of credit applications and acceptances; (ii) to sign such Borrower's or ATI's name on bills of lading; (iii) to clear Inventory through the United States of America Customs Department ("Customs") in the name of such Borrower or ATI or Agent or Agent's designee, and to sign and deliver to Customs officials powers of attorney in the name of such Borrower or ATI for such purpose; and (iv) to complete in such Borrower's or ATI's name or Agent's, or in the name of Agent's designee, any order, sale or transaction, obtain the necessary documents in connection therewith, and collect the proceeds thereof. Neither Agent nor its attorneys will be liable for any acts or omissions nor for any error of judgment or mistakes of fact or law, except for Agent's or its attorney's willful misconduct or gross negligence. This power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable as long as any Letters of Credit remain outstanding. (d) Each Lender shall to the extent of the percentage amount equal to the product of such Lender's Commitment Percentage times the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of all unreimbursed reimbursement obligations arising from disbursements made or obligations incurred with respect to the Letters of Credit be deemed to have irrevocably purchased an undivided participation in each such unreimbursed reimbursement obligation. In the event that at the time a disbursement is made the unpaid balance of Revolving Advances exceeds or would exceed, with the making of such disbursement, the lesser of the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or the Formula Amount, and such disbursement is not reimbursed by Borrowers within two (2) Business Days, Agent shall promptly notify each Lender and upon Agent's demand each Lender shall pay to Agent such Lender's proportionate share of such unreimbursed disbursement together with such Lender's proportionate share of Agent's reasonable unreimbursed costs and expenses relating to such unreimbursed disbursement. Upon receipt by Agent of a repayment from any Borrower of any amount disbursed by Agent for which Agent had already been reimbursed by Lenders, Agent shall deliver to each Lender that Lender's pro rata share of such repayment. Each Lender's participation commitment shall continue until the last to occur of any of the following events: (A) Agent ceases to be obligated to issue or cause to be issued Letters of Credit hereunder; (B) no Letter of Credit issued hereunder remains outstanding and uncancelled or (C) all Persons (other than the applicable 29
Borrower) have been fully reimbursed for all payments made under or relating to Letters of Credit. 2.11 Additional Payments. Any sums reasonably expended by Agent or any Lender due to any Borrower's failure to perform or comply with its obligations under this Agreement or any Other Document including, without limitation, any Borrower's obligations under Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 6.1 hereof, may be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance and added to the Obligations. 2.12 Manner of Borrowing and Payment. (a) Each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders. (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrowers on account of the principal of and interest on the Revolving Advances, shall be applied to the Revolving Advances pro rata according to the applicable Commitment Percentages of Lenders. Except as expressly provided herein, all payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made to Agent on behalf of the Lenders to the Payment Office, in each case on or prior to 1:00 P.M., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. (c) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 2.12(a) and (b) hereof, commencing with the first Business Day following the Closing Date, each borrowing of Revolving Advances shall be advanced by Agent and each payment by any Borrower on account of Revolving Advances shall be applied first to those Revolving Advances advanced by Agent. On or before 1:00 P.M., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time, on each Settlement Date commencing with the first Settlement Date following the Closing Date, Agent and Lenders shall make certain payments as follows: (I) if the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made by Agent during the preceding Week (if any) exceeds the aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such preceding Week, then each Lender shall provide Agent with funds in an amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (w) such Revolving Advances and (x) such repayments and (II) if the aggregate amount of repayments applied to outstanding Revolving Advances during such Week exceeds the aggregate amount of new Revolving Advances made during such Week, then Agent shall provide each Lender with funds in an amount equal to its applicable Commitment Percentage of the difference between (y) such repayments and (z) such Revolving Advances. (ii) Each Lender shall be entitled to earn interest at the applicable Contract Rate on outstanding Advances which it has funded. (iii) Promptly following each Settlement Date, Agent shall submit to each Lender a certificate with respect to payments received and Advances made during the Week immediately preceding such Settlement Date. Such certificate of Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of demonstrable error. 30
(d) If any Lender or Participant (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Advances, or interest thereon, or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by set-off) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and Collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other Lender's Advances, or interest thereon, and such greater proportionate payment or receipt of Collateral is not expressly permitted hereunder, such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participation in such portion of each such other Lender's Advances, or shall provide such other Lender with the benefits of any such Collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such Collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the other Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. Each Lender so purchasing a portion of another Lender's Advances may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion. (e) Unless Agent shall have been notified by telephone, confirmed in writing, by any Lender that such Lender will not make the amount which would constitute its applicable Commitment Percentage of the Advances available to Agent, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) assume that such Lender shall make such amount available to Agent on the next Settlement Date and, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. Agent will promptly notify Borrowers of its receipt of any such notice from a Lender. If such amount is made available to Agent on a date after such next Settlement Date, such Lender shall pay to Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days) during such period as quoted by Agent, times (ii) such amount, times (iii) the number of days from and including such Settlement Date to the date on which such amount becomes immediately available to Agent. A certificate of Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph (e) shall be conclusive, in the absence of demonstrable error. If such amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender within three (3) Business Days after such Settlement Date, Agent shall be entitled to recover such an amount, with interest thereon at the rate per annum then applicable to such Revolving Advances hereunder, on demand from Borrowers; provided, however, that Agent's right to such recovery shall not prejudice or otherwise adversely affect Borrowers' rights (if any) against such Lender. 2.13 Periodic Computations of Dollar Equivalent Amounts of Outstanding Letters of Credit; Requests for Additional Optional Currencies. The Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent amount of (i) proposed Letters of Credit to be denominated in an Optional Currency as of the requested date of issuance, as the case may be, and (ii) outstanding Letters of Credit denominated in an Optional Currency as of the last Business Day of each month, (each such date under clauses (i) and (ii), a "Computation Date"). The Borrowing Agent may deliver to the Agent a written request that Letters of Credit to be issued hereunder be permitted to be issued in any other lawful currency (other than Dollars), in addition to the currency specified in the definition of "Optional Currency" herein provided that such currency must be freely convertible into Dollars. The Agent will promptly notify the 31
Lenders of any such request. The Agent and each Lender may grant or accept such request in their sole discretion. The Agent will promptly notify the Borrowing Agent of the acceptance or rejection by the Agent and each of the Lenders of the Borrowing Agent's request. The requested currency shall be approved as an Optional Currency hereunder only if the Agent and all of the Lenders approve the Borrowing Agent's request. 2.14 Use of Proceeds. Borrowers shall apply the proceeds of Advances (i) to repay Indebtedness, if any, (ii) to pay fees and expenses relating to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) for general corporate purposes and (iv) to provide for working capital needs. 2.15 Defaulting Lender. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Lender (x) has refused (which refusal constitutes a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) to make available its portion of any Advance or (y) notifies either Agent or Borrowing Agent that it does not intend to make available its portion of any Advance (if the actual refusal would constitute a breach by such Lender of its obligations under this Agreement) (each, a "Lender Default"), all rights and obligations hereunder of such Lender (a "Defaulting Lender") as to which a Lender Default is in effect and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express provisions of this Section 2.15 while such Lender Default remains in effect. (b) Advances shall be incurred pro rata from Lenders (the "Non-Defaulting Lenders") which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or any pro rata share of any Advances required to be advanced by any Lender shall be increased as a result of such Lender Default. Amounts received in respect of principal of any type of Advances shall be applied to reduce the applicable Advances of each Lender pro rata based on the aggregate of the outstanding Advances of that type of all Lenders at the time of such application; provided, that, such amount shall not be applied to any Advances of a Defaulting Lender at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of Advances of any Non-Defaulting Lender exceeds such Non-Defaulting Lender's Commitment Percentage of all Advances then outstanding. (c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions to Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating to this Agreement and the Other Documents. All amendments, waivers and other modifications of this Agreement and the Other Documents may be made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the definition of "Required Lenders", a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and not to have Advances outstanding. (d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.15, the rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to indemnify Agent) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in this Section 2.15 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement and the Other Documents, shall alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender 32
hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, Agent or any Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder. (e) In the event a Defaulting Lender retroactively cures to the satisfaction of Agent the breach which caused a Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall no longer be a Defaulting Lender and shall be treated as a Lender under this Agreement (provided that such reinstatement as a "Lender" shall be without prejudice to any claims that Borrowers may have against the Defaulting Lender as a result of its default). 2.16 Currency Fluctuations. If on any Computation Date the aggregate balance of outstanding Revolving Advances and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding is in excess of the maximum amount of such Advances permitted hereunder as a result of a change in exchange rates between the Optional Currency and Dollars, then the Agent shall notify the Borrowing Agent of the same. The Borrowers shall pay or prepay the Revolving Advances (subject to Borrowers' indemnity obligations hereunder) within one (1) Business Day after receiving such notice such that the aggregate balance of outstanding Revolving Advances and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding shall not exceed the maximum amount of such Advances permitted hereunder after giving effect to such payments or prepayments. 2.17 Judgment Currency. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in any currency (the "Original Currency") into another currency (the "Other Currency"), the parties hereby agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures each Lender could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency after any premium and costs of exchange on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. (b) The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due from the Borrowers to any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in an Other Currency, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by any Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency, such Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency. If the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender in the Original Currency, Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment or payment, to indemnify such Lender against such loss. III. INTEREST AND FEES. 3.1 Interest. (a) Interest on Advances shall be payable in arrears on the first (1st) day of each month with respect to Domestic Rate Loans and, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, at the end of each Interest Period or, for Eurodollar Rate Loans with an Interest Period in 33
excess of three (3) months, at the earlier of (a) each three months on the anniversary date of the commencement of such Eurodollar Rate Loan or (b) the end of the Interest Period. Interest charges shall be computed on the actual principal amount of Advances outstanding during the month (the "Monthly Advances"). On the Closing Date through the day immediately preceding the first (1st) Incentive Pricing Effective Date, (x) Domestic Rate Loans shall bear interest for each day at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate and (y) Eurodollar Rate Loans shall bear interest for each applicable Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus two and one quarter of one percent (2.25%). (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during each calendar month of the Borrowers, in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof, the Borrowing Agent shall submit to the Agent a Borrowing Base Certificate as of the last day of the prior calendar month. Upon receipt of the Borrowing Base Certificate by the Agent as of June 30, 2003 and as of the last day of each calendar month thereafter, the Borrowers' daily average Undrawn Availability shall be calculated for the calendar month then ending. From the first (1st) day of the first (1st) full calendar month following the Agent's receipt of such Borrowing Base Certificate (the "Incentive Pricing Effective Date") until the next Incentive Pricing Effective Date, (x) Domestic Rate Loans shall bear interest for each day at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin determined by reference to the Borrowers' Undrawn Availability (the "Applicable Base Rate Margin") set forth below and (y) Eurodollar Rate Loans shall bear interest during each applicable Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable margin determined by reference to the Borrowers' Undrawn Availability (the "Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin") set forth below: (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event that the Borrowers fail to timely deliver the Borrowing Base Certificate in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof, the Applicable Base Rate Margin, the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin and the Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Percentage shall be the amount corresponding to Tier IV until the delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event that the Borrowers fail to timely deliver the Borrowing Base Certificate in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage shall be the amount corresponding to Tier I until the delivery of such Borrowing Base Certificate. (d) Whenever, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Alternate Base Rate is increased or decreased, the applicable Contract Rate for Domestic Rate Loans shall be similarly changed without notice or demand of any kind by an amount equal to the amount of such change in the Alternate Base Rate during the time such change or changes remain in effect. The Eurodollar Rate shall be adjusted with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans without notice or 34
demand of any kind on the effective date of any change in the Reserve Percentage as of such effective date. Upon and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, (i) the Obligations shall bear interest at the applicable Contract Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum (the "Default Rate"). 3.2 Letter of Credit Fees. (a) Borrowers shall pay (x) to Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face Dollar Equivalent amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by the applicable percentage per annum determined by reference to the Borrowers' Undrawn Availability as set forth in Section 3.1(b) hereof (the "Applicable Letter of Credit Fee Percentage"), such fees to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each calendar quarter and on the last day of the Term and (y) to the Issuer, for its own account, fees for each Letter of Credit for the period from and excluding the date of issuance of same to and including the date of expiration or termination, equal to the average daily face Dollar Equivalent amount of each outstanding Letter of Credit multiplied by one eighth of one percent (.125%) per annum, such fees to be calculated on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year for the actual number of days elapsed and to be payable quarterly in arrears on the first (1st) day of each calendar quarter and on the last day of the Term and (z) to the Issuer, for its own account, any and all fees and expenses as agreed upon by the Issuer and the Borrowing Agent in connection with any Letter of Credit, including, without limitation, in connection with the opening, amendment or renewal of any such Letter of Credit and any acceptances created thereunder and shall reimburse Agent for any and all fees and expenses, if any, paid by Agent to the Issuer (all of the foregoing fees, the "Letter of Credit Fees"). All such charges shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Any such charge in effect at the time of a particular transaction shall be the charge for that transaction, notwithstanding any subsequent change in the Issuer's prevailing charges for that type of transaction. All Letter of Credit Fees payable hereunder shall be deemed earned in full on the date when the same are due and payable hereunder and shall not be subject to rebate or proration upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason. Immediately upon the request of the Agent after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrowers will cause cash to be deposited and maintained in an account with Agent, as cash collateral, in an amount equal to one hundred and five percent (105%) of the outstanding Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit, and each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent, in its discretion, on such Borrower's behalf and in such Borrower's name, to open such an account and to make and maintain deposits therein, or in an account opened by such Borrower, in the amounts required to be made by such Borrower, out of the proceeds of Receivables or other Collateral or out of any other funds of such Borrower coming into any Lender's possession at any time. Agent will invest such cash collateral (less applicable reserves) in such short-term money-market items as to which Agent and such Borrower mutually agree and the net return on such investments shall be credited to such account and constitute additional cash collateral. So long as such Default or Event of Default is 35
continuing, no Borrower may withdraw amounts credited to any such account except upon payment and performance in full of all Obligations and termination of this Agreement. 3.3 Facility Fee. If, for any fiscal quarter during the Term, the average daily unpaid balance of the Revolving Advances for each day of such fiscal quarter does not equal the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount, then Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders a fee at a rate per annum equal to the applicable percentage determined by reference to the Borrowers' Undrawn Availability as set forth in Section 3.1(b) hereof (the "Applicable Facility Fee Percentage") multiplied by the amount by which the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount exceeds such average daily unpaid balance, such fees shall be payable to the Agent in arrears on the first (1st) day of each fiscal quarter after the date hereof until the termination hereof and on the earlier of (i) such termination date or (ii) the last day of the Term. 3.4 Reserved. 3.5 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and for the actual number of days elapsed. If any payment to be made hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest thereon shall be payable at the applicable Contract Rate during such extension. 3.6 Maximum Charges. In no event whatsoever shall interest and other charges charged hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under law. In the event interest and other charges as computed hereunder would otherwise exceed the highest rate permitted under law, such excess amount shall be first applied to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrowers, and if the then remaining excess amount is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, Lenders shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrowers and the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate. 3.7 Increased Costs. In the event that any applicable law, treaty or governmental regulation, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.7, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other financial, monetary or other authority, shall: (a) subject Agent or any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document or change the basis of taxation of payments to Agent or any Lender of principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable 36
hereunder or under any Other Documents (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Agent or any Lender by the jurisdiction in which it maintains its principal office); (b) impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, assessment or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, any office of Agent or any Lender, including (without limitation) pursuant to Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or (c) impose on Agent or any Lender or the London interbank Eurodollar market any other condition with respect to this Agreement or any Other Document; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any Lender of making, renewing or maintaining its Advances hereunder by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material or to reduce the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any of the Advances by an amount that Agent or such Lender deems to be material, then, in any case Borrowers shall promptly pay Agent or such Lender, upon its demand, such additional amount as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such additional cost or such reduction, as the case may be, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to increased costs which are reflected in the Eurodollar Rate. Agent or such Lender shall certify the amount of such additional cost or reduced amount to Borrowers, and such certification shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. 3.8 Basis For Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. In the event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that: (a) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof for any Interest Period; or (b) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant maturity are not available in the London interbank Eurodollar market, with respect to an outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loan, a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or a proposed conversion of a Domestic Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Rate Loan, then Agent shall give Borrowing Agent prompt written, telephonic or telegraphic notice of such determination. If such notice is given, (i) any such requested Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be made as a Domestic Rate Loan, unless Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) two (2) Business Days prior to the date of such proposed borrowing, that its request for such borrowing shall be cancelled or made as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, (ii) any Domestic Rate Loan or Eurodollar Rate Loan which was to have been converted to an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be continued as or converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed conversion, shall be maintained as an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, and (iii) any outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be converted into a Domestic Rate Loan, or, if Borrowing Agent shall notify Agent, no later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania time) two (2) Business Days prior to the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period 37
applicable to such affected Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall be converted into an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan, on the last Business Day of the then current Interest Period for such affected Eurodollar Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn, Lenders shall have no obligation to make an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan or maintain outstanding affected Eurodollar Rate Loans and no Borrower shall have the right to convert a Domestic Rate Loan or an unaffected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan into an affected type of Eurodollar Rate Loan. 3.9 Capital Adequacy. (a) In the event that Agent or any Lender shall have determined that any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any Lender (for purposes of this Section 3.9, the term "Lender" shall include Agent or any Lender and any corporation or bank controlling Agent or any Lender) and the office or branch where Agent or any Lender (as so defined) makes or maintains any Eurodollar Rate Loans with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Agent or any Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Agent or such Lender could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration Agent's and each Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Agent or any Lender to be material, then, from time to time, Borrowers shall pay upon demand to Agent or such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Agent or such Lender for such reduction. In determining such amount or amounts, Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging or attribution methods. The protection of this Section 3.9 shall be available to Agent and each Lender regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability with respect to the applicable law, regulation or condition. (b) A certificate of Agent or such Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate Agent or such Lender with respect to Section 3.9(a) hereof when delivered to Borrowers shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. 3.10 Other Considerations. The obligations of Borrowers in Sections 3.7 and 3.9 hereof, are subject to the following: (a) no Lender shall enforce these provisions solely against Borrowers or against a few of such Lender's customers without in each case generally enforcing these (or similar provisions in other contracts) (provided that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be required to disclose to Borrowers the identity of, or the nature of the Lender's relationship with, any other of such Lender's customers) and (b) each Lender shall designate a different lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or materially reduce the amount of, such compensation, costs or chargers and will not be otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Lender; and (c) any charges, costs or compensation charged to any Lender pursuant to such sections must be directly attributable to the Revolving Advances. 38
IV. COLLATERAL: GENERAL TERMS. 4.1 Security Interest in the Collateral. To secure the prompt payment and performance to Agent and each Lender of the Obligations, each Loan Party hereby assigns, pledges and grants to Agent for its benefit and for the ratable benefit of each Lender a continuing security interest in and to all of its Collateral, whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising and wheresoever located. Each Loan Party shall protect and perfect Agent's security interest and shall cause its financial statements to reflect such security interest. Each Loan Party shall promptly provide Agent with written notice of all commercial tort claims for which the amount of damages sought exceeds Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($500,000.00), such notice to contain the case title together with the applicable court and a brief description of the claim(s). Upon delivery of each such notice, such Loan Party shall be deemed to hereby grant to Agent a security interest and lien in and to such commercial tort claims and all proceeds thereof. 4.2 Perfection of Security Interest. Each Loan Party shall take all action that may be necessary or desirable, or that Agent may reasonably request, so as at all times to maintain the validity, perfection, enforceability and priority of Agent's security interest in the Collateral or to enable Agent to protect, exercise or enforce its rights hereunder and in the Collateral, including, but not limited to, (i) immediately discharging all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain applicable Waivers, as Agent may reasonably request (provided that the Loan Parties shall not be required to obtain Waivers for those locations of Loan Parties identified on Schedule 8.1(t) at which less than Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) of Collateral is located), (iii) delivering to Agent, endorsed or accompanied by such instruments of assignment as Agent may specify, and stamping or marking, in such manner as Agent may specify, any and all chattel paper, instruments, letters of credits and advices thereof and documents evidencing or forming a part of the Collateral, (iv) entering into warehousing, lockbox and other custodial arrangements satisfactory to Agent as required hereunder, and (v) executing and delivering financing statements, control agreements, instruments of pledge, notices and assignments, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to Agent, relating to the creation, validity, perfection, maintenance or continuation of Agent's security interest in Collateral under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. Agent is hereby authorized to file financing statements signed by Agent instead of a Loan Party in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from time to time. By its signature hereto, each Loan Party hereby authorizes Agent to file against such Loan Party, one or more financing, continuation, or amendment statements pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in form and substance satisfactory to Agent. All reasonable charges, expenses and fees Agent may incur in doing any of the foregoing, and any local taxes relating thereto, shall be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations, or, at Agent's option, shall be paid to Agent for the ratable benefit of Lenders immediately upon demand. 39
4.3 Disposition of Collateral. Each Loan Party will safeguard and protect all Collateral for Agent's general account and make no disposition thereof whether by sale, lease or otherwise except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Loan Party shall have the right to take all steps with respect to any commercial tort claim which such Loan Party shall in its reasonable discretion deem advisable, including termination or settlement of any such commercial tort claim. 4.4 Preservation of Collateral. Following the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or Event of Default in addition to the rights and remedies set forth in Section 11.1 hereof, Agent: (a) may at any time take such steps as Agent deems necessary to protect Agent's interest in and to preserve the Collateral, including the hiring of such security guards or the placing of other security protection measures as Agent may deem appropriate; (b) may employ and maintain at any of any Loan Party's premises a custodian who shall have full authority to do all acts necessary to protect Agent's interests in the Collateral; (c) may lease warehouse facilities to which Agent may move all or part of the Collateral; (d) may use any Loan Party's owned or leased lifts, hoists, trucks and other facilities or equipment for handling or removing the Collateral; and (e) shall have, and is hereby granted, a right of ingress and egress to the places where the Collateral is located, and may proceed over and through any of any Loan Party's owned or leased property. Each Loan Party shall cooperate fully with all of Agent's efforts to preserve the Collateral as permitted in the foregoing sentence and will take such actions to preserve the Collateral as Agent may direct. All of Agent's expenses of preserving the Collateral in accordance with the foregoing, including any expenses relating to the bonding of a custodian, shall be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations. 4.5 Ownership of Collateral. With respect to the Collateral, at the time the Collateral becomes subject to Agent's security interest: (a) each Loan Party shall be the sole owner of and fully authorized and able to sell, transfer, pledge and/or grant a first priority security interest in each and every item of its respective Collateral to Agent; and, except for Permitted Encumbrances, the Collateral shall be free and clear of all Liens and encumbrances whatsoever; (b) each document and agreement executed by each Loan Party or delivered to Agent or any Lender in connection with this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects; (c) all signatures and endorsements of each Loan Party that appear on such documents and agreements shall be genuine and each Loan Party shall have full capacity to execute same; and (d) each Loan Party's Inventory shall be located as set forth on Schedule 4.5 (as such Schedule may be updated from time to time) and shall not be removed from such location(s) without the prior written consent of Agent except with respect to the sale of Inventory in the ordinary course of business and with respect to Inventory in transit from one location identified on Schedule 4.5 (as such Schedule may be updated from time to time) to another location identified on Schedule 4.5. 40
4.6 Defense of Agent's and Lenders' Interests. Until (a) payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations and (b) termination of this Agreement, Agent's interests in the Collateral shall continue in full force and effect. During such period no Loan Party shall, without Agent's prior written consent, pledge, sell (except Inventory in the ordinary course of business), assign, transfer, create or suffer to exist a Lien upon or encumber or allow or suffer to be encumbered in any way except for Permitted Encumbrances, any part of the Collateral. Each Loan Party shall defend Agent's interests in the Collateral against any and all Persons whatsoever, except against holders of Permitted Liens that have a perfected security interest with priority over the Agent's. At any time following demand by Agent for payment of all Obligations, Agent shall have the right to take possession of the indicia of the Collateral and the Collateral in whatever physical form contained, including without limitation: labels, stationery, documents, instruments and advertising materials. If Agent exercises this right to take possession of the Collateral, the Loan Parties shall, upon demand, assemble it in the best manner possible and make it available to Agent at a place reasonably convenient to Agent. In addition, with respect to all Collateral, Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies set forth herein and further provided by the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, each Loan Party shall, and Agent may, at its option, instruct all suppliers, carriers, forwarders, warehousers or others receiving or holding cash, checks, Inventory, documents or instruments in which Agent holds a security interest to deliver same to Agent and/or subject to Agent's order and if they shall come into any Loan Party's possession, they, and each of them, shall be held by such Loan Party in trust as Agent's trustee, and such Loan Party will immediately deliver them to Agent in their original form together with any necessary endorsement. 4.7 Books and Records. Each Loan Party shall (a) keep proper books of record and account in which full, true and correct entries will be made of all dealings or transactions of or in relation to its business and affairs; (b) set up on its books accruals with respect to all taxes, assessments, charges, levies and claims; and (c) on a reasonably current basis set up on its books, from its earnings, allowances against doubtful Receivables, advances and investments and all other proper accruals (including without limitation by reason of enumeration, accruals for premiums, if any, due on required payments and accruals for depreciation, obsolescence, or amortization of properties), which should be set aside from such earnings in connection with its business. All determinations pursuant to this subsection shall be made in accordance with, or as required by, GAAP consistently applied in the opinion of such independent public accountant as shall then be regularly engaged by the Loan Parties. 4.8 Financial Disclosure. Upon the Loan Parties prior consent if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of Default, each Loan Party hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs all accountants and auditors employed by such Loan Party at any time during the Term and promptly after the 41
request of the Agent to exhibit and deliver to Agent and each Lender copies of any Loan Party's financial statements, trial balances or other accounting records of any sort in the accountant's or auditor's possession, and to disclose to Agent and each Lender any information such accountants may have concerning such Loan Party's financial status and business operations. In accordance with and subject to the foregoing, each Loan Party hereby authorizes all federal, state and municipal authorities to furnish to Agent and each Lender copies of reports or examinations relating to such Loan Party, whether made by such Loan Party or otherwise; however, Agent and each Lender will attempt to obtain such information or materials directly from such Loan Party prior to obtaining such information or materials from such accountants or such authorities. 4.9 Compliance with Laws. Each Loan Party shall comply with all laws, acts, rules, regulations and orders of any Governmental Body with jurisdiction over it or its respective Collateral or any part thereof or to the operation of such Loan Party's business the non-compliance with which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Loan Party may, however, contest or dispute any acts, rules, regulations, orders and directions of those bodies or officials in any reasonable manner, provided that any related Lien is inchoate or stayed and sufficient reserves are established to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent to protect Agent's Lien on or security interest in the Collateral. The assets of the Loan Parties at all times shall be maintained in accordance with the material requirements of all insurance carriers which provide insurance with respect to the assets of the Loan Parties so that such insurance shall remain in full force and effect. 4.10 Inspection of Premises. At all reasonable times after providing reasonable advance notice to the Loan Parties (at least once per year and such additional times as the Agent deems necessary), Agent shall have full access to and the right to audit, check, inspect and make abstracts and copies from each Loan Party's books, records, audits, correspondence and all other papers relating to the Collateral and the operation of each Loan Party's business. After providing reasonable advance notice to the Loan Parties, Agent and its agents may enter upon any of each Loan Party's premises at any time during business hours and at any other reasonable time, and from time to time (at least once per year and such additional times as the Agent deems necessary), for the purpose of inspecting and appraising the Collateral and any and all records pertaining thereto and the operation of such Loan Party's business. In addition to the foregoing, the Lenders shall have the same rights as the Agent under this Section 4.10 provided that all such audits, inspections and appraisals conducted by the Lenders shall be at their sole cost and expense. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, such audits, inspections and appraisals may be conducted at any time and from time to time and neither the Agent nor the Lenders shall be required to provide advance notice to the Loan Parties with respect to conducting such audits, inspections and appraisals. 42
4.11 Insurance. Each Loan Party shall bear the full risk of any loss of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Collateral. At each Loan Party's own cost and expense in amounts and with carriers acceptable to Agent, each Loan Party shall (a) keep all its insurable properties and properties in which each Loan Party has an interest insured against the hazards of fire, flood, sprinkler leakage, those hazards covered by extended coverage insurance and such other hazards, and for such amounts, as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to such Loan Party's including, without limitation, business interruption insurance; (b) maintain a bond in such amounts as is customary in the case of companies engaged in businesses similar to such Loan Party insuring against larceny, embezzlement or other criminal misappropriation of insured's officers and employees who may either singly or jointly with others at any time have access to the assets or funds of such Loan Party either directly or through authority to draw upon such funds or to direct generally the disposition of such assets; (c) maintain public and product liability insurance against claims for personal injury, death or property damage suffered by others; (d) maintain all such worker's compensation or similar insurance as may be required under the laws of any state or jurisdiction in which such Loan Party is engaged in business; (e) furnish Agent with (i) copies of all policies and evidence of the maintenance of such policies by the renewal thereof before any expiration date, and (ii) appropriate loss payable endorsements in form and substance satisfactory to Agent, naming Agent as a co-insured and loss payee as its interests may appear with respect to all insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a), and (c) above, and providing (A) that all proceeds thereunder shall be payable to Agent, (B) no such insurance shall be affected by any act or neglect of the insured or owner of the property described in such policy, and (C) that such policy and loss payable clauses may not be cancelled, amended or terminated unless at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice is given to Agent. In the event of any loss thereunder, the carriers named therein hereby are directed by Agent and the applicable Loan Party to make payment for such loss to Agent and not to such Loan Party and Agent jointly. If any insurance losses are paid by check, draft or other instrument payable to any Loan Party and Agent jointly, Agent may endorse such Loan Party's name thereon and do such other things as Agent may deem advisable to reduce the same to cash. Agent is hereby authorized to adjust and compromise claims under insurance coverage referred to in clauses (a), and (b) above. All loss recoveries with respect to Collateral received by Agent upon any such insurance may be applied to the Obligations, in such order as Agent in its sole discretion shall determine. Any surplus with respect to Collateral shall be paid by Agent to Loan Parties or applied as may be otherwise required by law. Any deficiency thereon shall be paid by Loan Parties to Agent, on demand. Any loss recoveries not relating to items of Collateral shall be paid by Agent to Loan Parties. Anything hereinabove to the contrary notwithstanding, and subject to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth below, Agent shall remit to Loan Parties insurance proceeds with respect to Collateral received by Agent during any calendar year under insurance policies procured and maintained by Loan Parties which insure Loan Parties' insurable Collateral to the extent such insurance proceeds do not exceed Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) in the aggregate during such calendar year or Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00) per occurrence. In the event the amount of insurance proceeds with respect to Collateral received by Agent for any occurrence exceeds Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), then Agent shall not be obligated to remit the insurance proceeds to Loan Parties unless Loan Parties shall provide Agent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the insurance proceeds will be used by Loan Parties to repair, replace or restore the insured 43
Collateral which was the subject of the insurable loss. In the event the Loan Parties have previously received (or, after giving effect to any proposed remittance by Agent to the Loan Parties would receive) insurance proceeds with respect to Collateral which equal or exceed Ten Million and 00/100 Dollars ($10,000,000.00) in the aggregate during any calendar year, then Agent may, in its sole discretion, either remit the insurance proceeds to the Loan Parties upon the Loan Parties providing Agent with evidence reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the insurance proceeds will be used by the Loan Parties to repair, replace, restore or reuse the insured Collateral which was the subject of the insurable loss, or apply the proceeds to the Obligations, as aforesaid. The agreement of Agent to remit insurance proceeds in the manner above provided shall be subject in each instance to satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (x) No Event of Default or Default shall then have occurred and be continuing, and (y) the Loan Parties shall use the insurance proceeds with respect to Collateral to repair, replace, restore or reuse the insured Collateral which was the subject of the insurable loss and for no other purpose. 4.12 Failure to Pay Insurance. If any Loan Party fails to obtain insurance as hereinabove provided, or to keep the same in force, Agent, if Agent so elects, may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor on behalf of such Loan Party, and charge Borrowers' Account therefor as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and such expenses so paid shall be part of the Obligations. 4.13 Payment of Taxes. Each Loan Party will pay, when due, all taxes, assessments and other Charges lawfully levied or assessed upon such Loan Party or any of the Collateral including, without limitation, real and personal property taxes, assessments and charges and all franchise, income, employment, social security benefits, withholding, and sales taxes, except those taxes, assessments or Charges to the extent that any Loan Party has contested or disputed those taxes, assessments or Charges in good faith, by expeditious protest, administrative or judicial appeal or similar proceeding provided that any related tax Lien is stayed and sufficient reserves are established to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent to protect Agent's security interest in or Lien on the Collateral. If any tax by any governmental authority is or may be imposed on or as a result of any transaction between any Loan Party and Agent or any Lender which Agent or any Lender may be required to withhold or pay or if any taxes, assessments, or other Charges remain unpaid after the date fixed for their payment, or if any claim shall be made which, in Agent's or any Lender's opinion, may possibly create a valid Lien on the Collateral, Agent may without notice to the Loan Parties pay the taxes, assessments or other Charges and each Loan Party hereby indemnifies and holds Agent and each Lender harmless in respect thereof. Agent will not pay any taxes, assessments or Charges to the extent that any Loan Party has contested or disputed those taxes, assessments or Charges in good faith, by expeditious protest, administrative or judicial appeal or similar proceeding provided that any related tax lien is stayed and sufficient reserves are established to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent to protect Agent's security interest in or Lien on the Collateral. The amount of any payment by Agent under this Section 4.13 shall be charged to Borrowers' Account as a Revolving Advance of a Domestic Rate Loan and added to the Obligations and, until the Loan Parties shall furnish Agent with an indemnity therefor (or supply Agent with evidence satisfactory to Agent that due provision for the payment thereof has 44
been made), Agent may hold without interest any balance standing to Loan Parties' credit and Agent shall retain its security interest in any and all Collateral held by Agent. 4.14 Payment of Leasehold Obligations. Each Loan Party shall at all times pay, when and as due, its rental obligations under all leases under which it is a tenant, except those rental obligations to the extent that any Loan Party has contested or disputed those rental obligations in good faith by expeditious protest provided that sufficient reserves are established with respect thereto to the reasonable satisfaction of Agent, and shall otherwise comply, in all material respects, with all other terms of such leases and keep them in full force and effect and, at Agent's request will provide evidence of having done so, except to the extent that such failure to comply would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.15 Receivables. (a) Nature of Receivables. Each of the Receivables shall be a bona fide and valid account representing a bona fide indebtedness incurred by the Customer therein named, for a fixed sum as set forth in the invoice relating thereto (provided immaterial or unintentional invoice errors shall not be deemed to be a breach hereof) with respect to an absolute sale or lease and delivery of goods upon stated terms of a Loan Party, or work, labor or services theretofore rendered by a Loan Party as of the date each Receivable is created. Same shall be due and owing without dispute, setoff or counterclaim except as may be stated on the accounts receivable schedules delivered by Loan Parties to Agent. (b) Solvency of Customers. Each Customer, to the Loan Party's actual knowledge, as of the date each Receivable is created, is and will be solvent and able to pay all Receivables on which the Customer is obligated in full when due or with respect to such Customers of any Loan Party who are not solvent such Loan Party has set up on its books and in its financial records bad debt reserves adequate to cover the uncollectible portion. (c) Locations of Loan Parties. Each Loan Party's chief executive office is located at the addresses set forth on Schedule 4.15(c) hereto (as such Schedule shall be updated from time to time). Until written notice is given to Agent by Borrowing Agent of any other office at which any Loan Party keeps its records pertaining to Receivables, all such records shall be kept at such executive office. (d) Collection of Receivables. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Dominion Triggering Event, until any Loan Party's authority to do so is terminated by Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (which notice Agent may give at any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default or a Default), each Loan Party will, at such Loan Party's cost and expense, but on Agent's behalf and for Agent's account, collect as Agent's property and in trust for Agent all amounts due on Receivables, and shall not commingle such collections with any Loan Party's funds or use the same except to pay Obligations. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Dominion Triggering Event, each Borrower shall deliver to Agent, or deposit in the Blocked Account, in original form and on the date of receipt thereof, all checks, drafts, notes, money orders, acceptances, cash and other evidences of Indebtedness. 45
(e) Notification of Assignment of Receivables. At any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or a Default, Agent shall have the right to send notice of the assignment of, and Agent's security interest in, the Receivables to any and all Customers or any third party holding or otherwise concerned with any of the Collateral. Thereafter, Agent shall have the sole right to collect the Receivables, take possession of the Collateral, or both. Agent's actual collection expenses, including, but not limited to, stationery and postage, telephone and telegraph, secretarial and clerical expenses and the salaries of any collection personnel used for collection, may be charged to Borrowers' Account and added to the Obligations. (f) Power of Agent to Act on Loan Parties' Behalf. Agent shall have the right, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, to receive, endorse, assign and/or deliver in the name of Agent or any Loan Party any and all checks, drafts and other instruments for the payment of money relating to the Receivables, and each Loan Party hereby waives notice of presentment, protest and non-payment of any instrument so endorsed. Each Loan Party hereby constitutes Agent or Agent's designee as such Loan Party's attorney with power at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Default (i) to endorse such Loan Party's name upon any notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment or Collateral; (ii) to sign such Loan Party's name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Receivables, drafts against Customers, assignments and verifications of Receivables; (iii) to send verifications of Receivables to any Customer; (iv) to sign such Loan Party's name on all financing statements or any other documents or instruments deemed necessary or appropriate by Agent to preserve, protect, or perfect Agent's interest in the Collateral and to file same; (v) to demand payment of the Receivables; (vi) to enforce payment of the Receivables by legal proceedings or otherwise; (vii) to exercise all of Loan Parties' rights and remedies with respect to the collection of the Receivables and any other Collateral; (viii) to settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew the Receivables; (ix) to settle, adjust or compromise any legal proceedings brought to collect Receivables; (x) to prepare, file and sign such Loan Party's name on a proof of claim in bankruptcy or similar document against any Customer; (xi) to prepare, file and sign such Loan Party's name on any notice of Lien, assignment or satisfaction of Lien or similar document in connection with the Receivables; and (xii) to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out this Agreement. All acts of said attorney or designee are hereby ratified and approved, and said attorney or designee shall not be liable for any acts of omission or commission nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or of law, unless done maliciously or with gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct; this power being coupled with an interest is irrevocable while any of the Obligations remain unpaid. Agent shall have the right at any time following the occurrence of an Event of Default or Default which is continuing, to change the address for delivery of mail addressed to any Loan Party to such address as Agent may designate and to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any Loan Party. (g) No Liability. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall, under any circumstances or in any event whatsoever, have any liability for any error or omission or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, collection or payment of any of the Receivables or any instrument received in payment thereof, or for any damage resulting therefrom unless such liability arises from Agent's or any Lender's willful misconduct or gross negligence as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Following the occurrence of an Event of 46
Default or Default which is continuing, Agent may, without notice or consent from any Loan Party, sue upon or otherwise collect, extend the time of payment of, compromise or settle for cash, credit or upon any terms any of the Receivables or any other securities, instruments or insurance applicable thereto and/or release any obligor thereof. Agent is authorized and empowered to accept following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Default the return of the goods represented by any of the Receivables, without notice to or consent by any Loan Party, all without discharging or in any way affecting any Loan Party's liability hereunder. (h) Establishment of a Lockbox Account, Dominion Account. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Dominion Triggering Event, all proceeds of Collateral of the Borrowers shall be deposited by Borrowers into a lockbox account, dominion account or such other "blocked account" ("Blocked Accounts") as Agent may require pursuant to a Blocked Account Agreement. Borrowers shall issue to any such bank, an irrevocable letter of instruction directing said bank to transfer such funds so deposited to Agent, either to any account maintained by Agent at said bank or by wire transfer to appropriate account(s) of Agent. All funds deposited in such Blocked Account shall immediately become the property of Agent and Borrowers shall obtain the agreement by such bank to waive any offset rights against the funds so deposited. Neither Agent nor any Lender assumes any responsibility for such blocked account arrangement, including without limitation, any claim of accord and satisfaction or release with respect to deposits accepted by any bank thereunder. Alternatively, upon the occurrence of a Cash Dominion Triggering Event, Agent may establish depository accounts ("Depository Accounts") in the name of Agent at a bank or banks for the deposit of such funds and Borrowers shall deposit all proceeds of Collateral or cause same to be deposited, in kind, in such Depository Accounts of Agent in lieu of depositing same to the Blocked Accounts. (i) Suspension of Cash Dominion. Notwithstanding anything that may be contained herein to the contrary, so long as (a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Borrowers' daily average Undrawn Availability for the most recently ended six (6) consecutive calendar months has been greater than or equal to Two Hundred Twenty-Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($225,000,000.00), (c) the proforma Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (for ATI and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis) for the period equal to the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended is not less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (d) not more than one Cash Dominion Triggering Event has occurred hereunder, upon a written request received by the Agent from the Borrowing Agent certifying that the above items (a) through (d) have occurred and requesting that (i) the requirements of Sections 4.15(d) and 4.15(h) be suspended until the next Cash Dominion Triggering Event occurs and (ii) the existing Blocked Account Agreements be terminated, the Agent shall terminate the existing Blocked Account Agreements and shall provide written notice to the Borrowing Agent that the requirements of Sections 4.15(d) and 4.15(h) will be suspended until the next Cash Dominion Triggering Event; provided, however, that the Agent shall have received, prior to the termination of the requirements of cash dominion hereunder, duly executed new Blocked Account Agreements establishing Blocked Accounts or Depository Accounts, as the case may be, with financial institutions acceptable to the Agent for the collection or servicing of the Receivables and proceeds of the Collateral and such agreements shall be satisfactory to the Agent in its sole reasonable discretion and be held in escrow until the occurrence of the next Cash Dominion Triggering Event. 47
(j) Adjustments. No Loan Party will, without Agent's consent, compromise or adjust any Receivables (or extend the time for payment thereof) or accept any returns of merchandise or grant any additional discounts, allowances or credits thereon except for those compromises, adjustments, returns, discounts, credits and allowances as have been heretofore customary in the business or industry of such Loan Party. 4.16 Maintenance of Equipment. The Equipment shall be maintained in good operating condition and repair in substantial accordance with industry standards (reasonable wear and tear excepted) and all necessary replacements of and repairs thereto shall be made, provided that no Loan Party shall have any obligation to maintain, replace or repair Equipment that is not reasonably deemed by such Loan Party to be necessary in the conduct of such Loan Party's business. No Loan Party shall use or operate the Equipment in violation of any law, statute, ordinance, code, rule or regulation except to the extent that such violation would not have a Material Adverse Effect. 4.17 Exculpation of Liability. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute Agent or any Lender as any Loan Party's agent for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall Agent or any Lender be responsible or liable for any shortage, discrepancy, damage, loss or destruction of any part of the Collateral wherever the same may be located and regardless of the cause thereof unless directly caused by the Agent's or any Lender's willful misconduct or gross negligence as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Neither Agent nor any Lender, whether by anything herein or in any assignment or otherwise, assume any of any Loan Party's obligations under any contract or agreement assigned to Agent or such Lender, and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be responsible in any way for the performance by any Loan Party of any of the terms and conditions thereof. 4.18 Environmental Matters. (a) The Loan Parties shall maintain the Real Property remains in compliance with all Environmental Laws except to the extent that such failure to comply would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and they shall not knowingly place or permit to be placed any Hazardous Substances on any Real Property except as permitted by applicable law, permits or appropriate governmental authorities.

(d) In the event any Loan Party obtains, gives or receives notice of any Release or threat of Release of a reportable quantity of any Hazardous Substances at the Real Property (any such event being hereinafter referred to as a "Hazardous Discharge") or receives any notice of violation, request for information or notification that it is potentially responsible for investigation or cleanup of environmental conditions at the Real Property, demand letter or complaint, order, citation, or other written notice with regard to any Hazardous Discharge or violation of Environmental Laws affecting the Real Property or any Loan Party's interest therein (any of the foregoing is referred to herein as an "Environmental Complaint") from any Person, including any state agency responsible in whole or in part for environmental matters in the state in which the Real Property is located or the United States Environmental Protection Agency (any such person or entity hereinafter the "Authority"), in each case dealing with matters which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, then Borrowing Agent shall, within five (5) Business Days, give written notice of same to Agent detailing facts and circumstances of which any Loan Party is aware giving rise to the Hazardous Discharge or Environmental Complaint. (e) The Loan Parties shall promptly forward to Agent copies of any request for information, notification of potential liability, demand letter relating to potential responsibility with respect to the investigation or cleanup of Hazardous Substances at any other site owned, operated or used by any Loan Party to dispose of Hazardous Substances and shall upon Agent's request, continue to forward copies of correspondence between any Loan Party and the Authority regarding such claims to Agent until the claim is settled in each case to the extent dealing with matters which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Loan Parties shall promptly forward to Agent copies of all documents and reports concerning a Hazardous Discharge at the Real Property that any Loan Party is required to file under any Environmental Laws.

The Loan Parties' obligations under this Section 4.18 shall arise upon the discovery of the presence of any Hazardous Substances at the Real Property in violation of applicable Environmental Laws, whether or not any federal, 49

XI. LENDERS' RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AFTER DEFAULT. 11.1 Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of (i) an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.8, all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and this Agreement and the obligation of Lenders to make Advances shall be deemed terminated; and, (ii) any of the other Events of Default and at any time thereafter (such default not having previously been cured), at the option of Required Lenders, all Obligations shall be immediately due and payable and Lenders shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and to terminate the obligation of Lenders to make Advances and (iii) a filing of a petition against any Loan Party in any involuntary case under any state or federal bankruptcy laws, the obligation of Lenders to make Advances hereunder shall be terminated other than as may be required by an appropriate order of the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over any Loan Party. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all other rights and remedies provided for herein, under the Uniform Commercial Code and at law or equity generally, including, without limitation, the right to foreclose the security interests granted herein and to realize upon any Collateral by any available judicial procedure and/or to take, to the extent permitted by applicable law, possession of and sell any or all of the Collateral with or without judicial process. Agent may enter any of any Loan Party's premises or other premises without legal process and without incurring liability to any Loan Party therefor, and Agent may thereupon, or at any time thereafter, in its discretion without notice or demand, take the Collateral and remove the same to such place as Agent may deem advisable and Agent may require the Loan Parties to make the Collateral available to Agent at a convenient place. With or without having the Collateral at the time or place of sale, Agent may sell the Collateral, or any part thereof, at public or private sale, at any time or place, in one or more sales, at such price or prices, and upon such terms, either for cash, credit or future delivery, as Agent may elect. Except as to that part of the Collateral which is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, Agent shall give the Loan Parties reasonable notification of such sale or sales, it being agreed that in all events written notice mailed to the Loan Parties at least five (5) days prior to such sale or sales is reasonable notification. At any public sale Agent or any Lender may bid for and become the purchaser, and Agent, any Lender or any other purchaser at any such sale thereafter shall hold the Collateral sold absolutely free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption and such right and equity are hereby expressly waived and released by each Loan Party. In connection with the exercise of the foregoing remedies, Agent is granted permission to use all of each Loan Party's trademarks, trade styles, trade names, patents, patent applications, licenses, franchises and other proprietary rights which are used in connection with (a) Inventory for the purpose of disposing of such Inventory and (b) Equipment for the purpose of completing the manufacture of unfinished goods. The proceeds realized from the sale of any Collateral shall be applied as follows: first, to the reasonable costs, expenses and attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Agent for collection and for acquisition, completion, protection, removal, storage, sale and delivery of the Collateral; second, to interest due upon any of the Obligations and any fees payable under this Agreement; and, third, to the principal of the Obligations. If any deficiency shall arise, Borrowers shall remain liable to Agent and Lenders therefor. 77
11.2 Reserved. 11.3 Setoff. In addition to any other rights which Agent or any Lender may have under applicable law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder, Agent and such Lender, including any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate of Agent or such Lender, shall have a right to apply any Loan Party's property held by Agent, such Lender, such branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to reduce the Obligations. 11.4 Rights and Remedies not Exclusive. The enumeration of the foregoing rights and remedies is not intended to be exhaustive and the exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedies provided for herein or otherwise provided by law, all of which shall be cumulative and not alternative. 11.5 Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or received by the Agent on account of the Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Other Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows: FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of the Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under this Agreement and the Other Documents and any protective advances made by the Agent with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent; THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents or otherwise with respect to the Obligations owing to such Lender; FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest arising under or pursuant to this Agreement or the Other Documents; FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the Obligations constituting Advances (including the payment or cash collateralization of the outstanding Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit) and the payment of Priority Lender Hedging Obligations; SIXTH, to all other Obligations (including the payment of Second Priority Lender Hedging Obligations) and other obligations which shall have become due and payable under the 78
Other Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive (so long as it is not a Defaulting Lender) an amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding Advances held by such Lender bears to the aggregate then outstanding Advances) of amounts available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn Dollar Equivalent amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuer from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this Section 11.5.

Each Loan Party hereby waives notice of non-payment of any of the Receivables, demand, presentment, protest and notice thereof with respect to any and all instruments, notice of acceptance hereof, notice of loans or advances made, credit extended, Collateral received or delivered, or any other action taken in reliance hereon, and all other demands and notices of any description, except such as are expressly provided for herein. 12.2 Delay. No delay or omission on Agent's or any Lender's part in exercising any right, remedy or option shall operate as a waiver of such or any other right, remedy or option or of any default. 12.3 Jury Waiver. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR (B) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO OR ANY OF THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE AND EACH PARTY HEREBY CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, 79
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENTS OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. XIII. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION. 13.1 Term. This Agreement, which shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the respective successors and permitted assigns of each Loan Party, Agent and each Lender, shall become effective on the date hereof and shall continue in full force and effect until June 13, 2007 (the "Term") unless sooner terminated as herein provided. The Loan Parties may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice upon payment in full of the Obligations. 13.2 Termination. The termination of this Agreement shall not affect any Loan Party's, Agent's or any Lender's rights, or any of the Obligations having their inception prior to the effective date of such termination, and the provisions hereof shall continue to be fully operative until all transactions entered into, rights or interests created or Obligations have been fully disposed of, concluded or liquidated. The security interests, Liens and rights granted to Agent and Lenders hereunder and the financing statements filed hereunder shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement or the fact that Borrowers' Account may from time to time be temporarily in a zero or credit position, until all of the Obligations of each Loan Party have been paid or performed in full after the termination of this Agreement or each Loan Party has furnished Agent and Lenders with an indemnification satisfactory to Agent and Lenders with respect thereto. Accordingly, each Loan Party waives any rights which it may have under the Uniform Commercial Code to demand the filing of termination statements with respect to the Collateral, and Agent shall not be required to send such termination statements to each Borrower, or to file them with any filing office, unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms and all Obligations paid in full in immediately available funds. All representations, warranties, covenants, waivers and agreements contained herein shall survive termination hereof until all Obligations are paid or performed in full. Without limitation, all indemnification obligations contained herein shall survive the termination hereof and payment in full of the Obligations. XIV. REGARDING AGENT. 14.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates PNC to act as Agent for such Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the Other Documents and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are 80
reasonably incidental thereto and Agent shall hold all Collateral, payments of principal and interest, fees (except the fees described in the Agent's Letter), charges and collections (without giving effect to any collection days) received pursuant to this Agreement, for the ratable benefit of Lenders. Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its agents or employees. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including without limitation, collection of the Notes) Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding; provided, however, that Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes Agent to liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or the Other Documents or applicable law unless Agent is furnished with an indemnification reasonably satisfactory to Agent with respect thereto. 14.2 Nature of Duties. (a) Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Other Documents. Neither Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be (i) liable for any action taken or omitted by them as such hereunder or in connection herewith, unless caused by their gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct, or (ii) responsible in any manner for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement, or in any of the Other Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents, as the case may be, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, due execution, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the Other Documents or for any failure of any Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder. Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any of the Other Documents, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party. The duties of Agent as respects the Advances to Borrowers shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. (b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no Person shall have, solely by reason of its designation as a documentation agent, any power, duty, responsibility or liability whatsoever under this Agreement or any of the Other Documents. 14.3 Lack of Reliance on Agent and Resignation. Independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, each Lender has made and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Loan Party in connection with the making and the continuance of the Advances hereunder and the taking or not taking of any action in connection herewith, and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Loan Party. Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or 81
other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before making of the Advances or at any time or times thereafter except as shall be provided by any Loan Party pursuant to the terms hereof. Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any agreement, document, certificate or a statement delivered in connection with or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Other Document, or of the financial condition of any Loan Party, or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement, the Note, the Other Documents or the financial condition of any Loan Party, or the existence of any Event of Default or any Default. Agent may resign on sixty (60) days' written notice to each of Lenders and Borrowing Agent and upon such resignation, the Required Lenders will promptly designate a successor Agent reasonably satisfactory to the Loan Parties. Any such successor Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent. After any Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Article XIV shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. 14.4 Certain Rights of Agent. If Agent shall request instructions from Lenders with respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this Agreement or any Other Document, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders; and Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, Lenders shall not have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of its acting or refraining from acting hereunder in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders. 14.5 Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message, cablegram, order or other document or telephone message believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or entity, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and the Other Documents and its duties hereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it. Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be liable for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by Agent with reasonable care. 14.6 Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder or under the Other Documents, unless Agent has received notice from a Lender or a Loan Party referring to this Agreement or the Other Documents, 82
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that Agent receives such a notice, Agent shall give notice thereof to Lenders. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided, that, unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of Lenders. 14.7 Indemnification. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Loan Parties, each Lender will reimburse and indemnify Agent in proportion to its respective portion of the Advances (or, if no Advances are outstanding, according to its Commitment Percentage), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent in performing its duties hereunder, or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any Other Document; provided that, Lenders shall not be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from Agent's gross (not mere) negligence or willful misconduct. 14.8 Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to the obligation of Agent to lend under this Agreement, the Advances made by it shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Lender and as if it were not performing the duties as Agent specified herein; and the term "Lender" or any similar term shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. Agent may engage in business with any Loan Party as if it were not performing the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from any Loan Party for services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to Lenders. 14.9 Delivery of Documents. To the extent Agent receives financial statements required under Sections 9.5, 9.6, 9.7 and 9.9 and a Borrowing Base Certificate from the Borrowing Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Agent will promptly furnish such documents and information to Lenders. 14.10 Borrowers' Undertaking to Agent. Without prejudice to their respective obligations to Lenders under the other provisions of this Agreement, each Borrower hereby undertakes with Agent to pay to Agent from time to time on demand all amounts from time to time due and payable by it for the account of Agent or Lenders or any of them pursuant to this Agreement to the extent not already paid. Any payment made pursuant to any such demand shall pro tanto satisfy the relevant Borrower's obligations to make payments for the account of Lenders or the relevant one or more of them pursuant to this Agreement. 83
XV. BORROWING AGENCY. 15.1 Borrowing Agency Provisions. (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably designates Borrowing Agent to be its attorney and agent and in such capacity to borrow, sign and endorse notes, and execute and deliver all instruments, documents, writings and further assurances now or hereafter required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower or Borrowers, and hereby authorizes Agent to pay over or credit all loan proceeds hereunder in accordance with the request of Borrowing Agent. (b) The handling of this credit facility as a co-borrowing facility with a borrowing agent in the manner set forth in this Agreement is solely as an accommodation to Borrowers and at their request. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall incur liability to Borrowers as a result thereof. To induce Agent and Lenders to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby indemnifies Agent and each Lender and holds Agent and each Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and claims of damage or injury asserted against Agent or any Lender by any Person arising from or incurred by reason of the handling of the financing arrangements of Borrowers as provided herein, reliance by Agent or any Lender on any request or instruction from Borrowing Agent or any other action taken by Agent or any Lender with respect to this Section 15.1 except due to willful misconduct or gross (not mere) negligence by the indemnified party. (c) All Obligations shall be joint and several (provided that the obligations of the Loan Parties other than ATI shall not be considered to guarantee or otherwise secure the obligations of ATI hereunder or under any Guaranty executed by ATI), and each Borrower shall make payment upon the maturity of the Obligations by acceleration or otherwise, and such obligation and liability on the part of each Borrower shall in no way be affected by any extensions, renewals and forbearance granted to Agent or any Lender to any Borrower, failure of Agent or any Lender to give any Borrower notice of borrowing or any other notice, any failure of Agent or any Lender to pursue or preserve its rights against any Loan Party, the release by Agent or any Lender of any Collateral now or thereafter acquired from any Loan Party, and such agreement by each Borrower to pay upon any notice issued pursuant thereto is unconditional and unaffected by prior recourse by Agent or any Lender to the other Borrowers or any Collateral for such Borrower's Obligations or the lack thereof. Each Borrower waives all suretyship defenses. 15.2 Waiver of Subrogation. Each Borrower expressly waives any and all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnity, exoneration, contribution or any other claim which such Borrower may now or hereafter have against the other Borrowers or other Person directly or contingently liable for the Obligations hereunder, or against or with respect to the other Borrowers' property (including, without limitation, any property which is Collateral for the Obligations), arising from the existence or performance of this Agreement, until termination of this Agreement and repayment in full of the Obligations. 84
XVI. MISCELLANEOUS. 16.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any judicial proceeding brought by or against any Loan Party with respect to any of the Obligations, this Agreement or any related agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Loan Party accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement. Each Loan Party hereby waives personal service of any and all process upon it and consents that all such service of process may be made by registered mail (return receipt requested) directed to Borrowing Agent at its address set forth in Section 16.6 and service so made shall be deemed completed five (5) days after the same shall have been so deposited in the mails of the United States of America, or, at the Agent's and/or any Lender's option, by service upon Borrowing Agent which each Loan Party irrevocably appoints as such Loan Party's Agent for the purpose of accepting service within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against any Loan Party in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Each Loan Party waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non conveniens. Any judicial proceeding by any Loan Party against Agent or any Lender involving, directly or indirectly, any matter or claim in any way arising out of, related to or connected with this Agreement or any related agreement, shall be brought only in a federal or state court located in the County of Allegheny, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 16.2 Entire Understanding.

(v) change the rights and duties of Agent. (vi) permit any Revolving Advance to be made if after giving effect thereto the sum of the Revolving Advances outstanding and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder would exceed (x) the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount or (y) the Formula Amount for more than thirty (30) consecutive Business Days or exceed one hundred and five percent (105%) of the Formula Amount. (vii) increase the Advance Rates above the Advance Rates in effect on the Closing Date. (viii) release any Loan Party from the Obligations under this Agreement, the applicable Guaranty, if any, or any Other Document. (ix) alter, amend or modify Section 11.5 hereof. Any such supplemental agreement shall apply equally to each Lender and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, Lenders and Agent and all future holders of the Obligations. In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, Agent and Lenders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, and any Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing, but no waiver of a specific Event of Default shall extend to any subsequent Event of Default (whether or not the subsequent Event of Default is the same as the Event of Default which was waived), or impair any right consequent thereon. In the event that Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to this Section 16.2 and such consent is denied, then PNC may, at its option, require such Lender to assign its interest in the Advances to PNC or to another Lender or to any other Person designated by the Agent (the "Designated Lender"), for a price equal to the then outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and fees due such Lender, which interest and fees shall be paid when 86
collected from Borrowers. In the event PNC elects to require any Lender to assign its interest to PNC or to the Designated Lender, PNC will so notify such Lender in writing within forty five (45) days following such Lender's denial, and such Lender will assign its interest to PNC or the Designated Lender no later than five (5) days following receipt of such notice pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement executed by such Lender, PNC or the Designated Lender, as appropriate, and Agent. Notwithstanding (a) the existence of a Default or an Event of Default, (b) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied or (c) any other provision of this Loan Agreement, Agent may at its discretion and without the consent of the Required Lenders, voluntarily permit the outstanding Revolving Advances and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding at any time to exceed one hundred and five percent (105%) of the Formula Amount for up to thirty (30) consecutive Business Days provided that such outstanding Advances do not exceed the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the discretion granted to Agent hereunder shall not preclude involuntary overadvances that may result from time to time due to the fact that the Formula Amount was unintentionally exceeded for any reason, including, but not limited to, Collateral previously deemed to be either "Eligible Receivables" or "Eligible Inventory", as applicable, becomes ineligible, collections of Receivables applied to reduce outstanding Revolving Advances are thereafter returned for insufficient funds or overadvances are made to protect or preserve the Collateral. In the event Agent involuntarily permits the outstanding Revolving Advances to exceed the Formula Amount by more than five percent (5%), Agent shall use its efforts to have Borrowers decrease such excess in as expeditious a manner as is practicable under the circumstances and not inconsistent with the reason for such excess. Revolving Advances made after Agent has determined the existence of involuntary overadvances shall be deemed to be involuntary overadvances and shall be decreased in accordance with the preceding sentence. In addition to (and not in substitution of) the discretionary Revolving Advances permitted above in this Section 16.2, the Agent is hereby authorized by the Loan Parties and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole discretion, (a) after the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default, or (b) at any time that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 8.2 hereof have not been satisfied, to make Revolving Advances to the Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders which the Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (i) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (ii) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Advances and other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to the Borrowers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement; provided, that at any time after giving effect to any such Revolving Advances, the outstanding Revolving Advances and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit outstanding do not exceed one hundred five percent (105%) of the Formula Amount or the Maximum Revolving Advance Amount. 16.3 Successors and Assigns; Participations; New Lenders. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Loan Parties, Agent, each Lender, all future holders of the Obligations and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Loan Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Agent and each Lender. 87
(b) Each Loan Party acknowledges that in the regular course of commercial banking business one or more Lenders may at any time and from time to time sell participating interests in the Advances to other financial institutions (each such transferee or purchaser of a participating interest, a "Transferee"). Each Transferee may exercise all rights of payment (including without limitation rights of set-off) with respect to the portion of such Advances held by it or other Obligations payable hereunder as fully as if such Transferee were the direct holder thereof provided that Borrowers shall not be required to pay to any Transferee more than the amount which it would have been required to pay to Lender which granted an interest in its Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to such Transferee had such Lender retained such interest in the Advances hereunder or other Obligations payable hereunder and in no event shall Borrowers be required to pay any such amount arising from the same circumstances and with respect to the same Advances or other Obligations payable hereunder to both such Lender and such Transferee. Each Loan Party hereby grants to any Transferee a continuing security interest in any deposits, moneys or other property actually or constructively held by such Transferee as security for the Transferee's interest in the Advances. (c) Any Lender may with the consent of (i) Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, solely with respect to a sale, assignment or transfer to a "foreign person" as defined in Section 1.1441-1(c)(2) of the Regulations, the Borrowers, sell, assign or transfer all or any part of its rights under this Agreement and the Other Documents to one or more additional banks or financial institutions and one or more additional banks or financial institutions may commit to make Advances hereunder (each a "Purchasing Lender"), in minimum amounts of not less than Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), pursuant to a Commitment Transfer Supplement, executed by a Purchasing Lender, the transferor Lender, and Agent and delivered to Agent for recording; provided that (i) no such consent of the Agent shall be required in the case of a sale, assignment or transfer by a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the transfer effective date determined pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (i) Purchasing Lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender thereunder with a Commitment Percentage as set forth therein, and (ii) the transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement, the Commitment Transfer Supplement creating a novation for that purpose. Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. The Loan Parties hereby consent to the addition of such Purchasing Lender and the resulting adjustment of the Commitment Percentages arising from the purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the Other Documents. The Loan Parties shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such further acts and things in order to effectuate the foregoing. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement, its Note and 88
the Other Documents to any of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341 without notice to or consent of the Borrowers or the Agent. No such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release the transferor Lender of its obligations hereunder or under any Other Document. (e) Agent shall maintain at its address a copy of each Commitment Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Advances owing to each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of demonstrable error, and Borrowers, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Advance recorded therein for the purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Agent shall receive a fee in the amount of Three Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($3,500.00) payable by the applicable Purchasing Lender upon the effective date of each transfer or assignment to such Purchasing Lender; provided that no such fee shall be payable if the Purchasing Lender is an Affiliate of the transferor Lender. (f) Each Loan Party authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Transferee or Purchasing Lender and any prospective Transferee or Purchasing Lender any and all financial information in such Lender's possession concerning such Loan Party which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of such Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of such Loan Party provided that such Lender first obtain a confidentiality agreement from such prospective Transferee or Purchasing Lender. 16.4 Application of Payments. Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any payment and any and all proceeds of Collateral to any portion of the Obligations. To the extent that any Loan Party makes a payment or Agent or any Lender receives any payment or proceeds of the Collateral for any Loan Party's benefit, which are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, debtor in possession, receiver, custodian or any other party under any bankruptcy law, common law or equitable cause, then, to such extent, the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by Agent or such Lender. 16.5 Indemnity. Each Loan Party shall indemnify Agent, each Lender and each of their respective officers, directors, Affiliates, employees and agents from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel) which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Agent or any Lender in any litigation, proceeding or investigation instituted or conducted by any governmental agency or instrumentality or any other Person with respect to any aspect of, or any transaction contemplated by, or referred to in, or any matter related to, this Agreement or the Other Documents, whether or not Agent or any Lender is a party thereto, except to the extent that 89
any of the foregoing arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party being indemnified. 16.6 Notice. Any notice or request hereunder may be given to Borrowing Agent or any Loan Party or to Agent or any Lender at their respective addresses set forth below or at such other address as may hereafter be specified in a notice designated as a notice of change of address under this Section. Any notice, request, demand, direction or other communication (for purposes of this Section 16.6 only, a "Notice") to be given to or made upon any party hereto under any provision of this Loan Agreement shall be given or made by telephone or in writing (which includes by means of electronic transmission (i.e., "e-mail") or facsimile transmission or by setting forth such Notice on a site on the World Wide Web (a "Website Posting") if Notice of such Website Posting (including the information necessary to access such site) has previously been delivered to the applicable parties hereto by another means set forth in this Section 16.6) in accordance with this Section 16.6. Any such Notice must be delivered to the applicable parties hereto at the addresses and numbers set forth under their respective names on Section 16.6 hereof or in accordance with any subsequent unrevoked Notice from any such party that is given in accordance with this Section 16.6.

16.8 Severability. If any part of this Agreement is contrary to, prohibited by, or deemed invalid under applicable laws or regulations, such provision shall be inapplicable and deemed omitted to the extent so contrary, prohibited or invalid, but the remainder hereof shall not be invalidated thereby and shall be given effect so far as possible. 16.9 Expenses. All costs and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees (including the allocated costs of in house counsel) and disbursements incurred by Agent on its behalf or on behalf of Lenders (a) in all efforts made to enforce payment of any Obligation or effect collection of any Collateral, or (b) in connection with the entering into, modification, amendment, administration and enforcement of this Agreement or any consents or waivers hereunder and all related agreements, documents and instruments, or (c) in instituting, maintaining, preserving, enforcing and foreclosing on Agent's security interest in or Lien on any of the Collateral, whether through judicial proceedings or otherwise, or (d) in defending or prosecuting any actions or proceedings arising out of or relating to Agent's or any Lender's transactions with any Loan Party, or (e) in connection with any advice given to Agent or any Lender with respect to its rights and obligations under this Agreement and all related agreements, may be charged to Borrowers' Account and shall be part of the Obligations.

Each Loan Party recognizes that, in the event any Loan Party fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, any remedy at law may prove to be inadequate relief to Lenders; therefore, Agent, if Agent so requests, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving that actual damages are not an adequate remedy. 16.11 Consequential Damages. Neither Agent nor any Lender, nor any agent or attorney for any of them, shall be liable to any Loan Party for any special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages arising from any breach of contract, tort or other wrong relating to the establishment, administration or collection of the Obligations. 16.12 Captions. The captions at various places in this Agreement are intended for convenience only and do not constitute and shall not be interpreted as part of this Agreement. 92

This Agreement may be executed in any number of and by different parties hereto on separate counterparts, all of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement. Any signature delivered by a party by facsimile transmission shall be deemed to be an original signature hereto. 16.14 Construction. The parties acknowledge that each party and its counsel have reviewed this Agreement and that the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any amendments, schedules or exhibits thereto. 16.15 Confidentiality; Sharing Information. (a) Agent, each Lender and each Transferee shall hold all non-public information obtained by Agent, such Lender or such Transferee pursuant to the requirements of this Agreement in accordance with Agent's, such Lender's and such Transferee's customary procedures for handling confidential information of this nature; provided, however, Agent, each Lender and each Transferee may disclose such confidential information (a) to its examiners, affiliates, outside auditors, counsel and other professional advisors, (b) to Agent, any Lender or to any prospective Transferees and Purchasing Lenders, and (c) as required or requested by any Governmental Body or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process; provided, further that (i) unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, Agent, each Lender and each Transferee shall use its best efforts prior to disclosure thereof, to notify the applicable Loan Party of the applicable request for disclosure of such non-public information (A) by a Governmental Body or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of a Lender or a Transferee by such Governmental Body) or (B) pursuant to legal process and (ii) in no event shall Agent, any Lender or any Transferee be obligated to return any materials furnished by any Loan Party other than those documents and instruments in possession of Agent or any Lender in order to perfect its Lien on the Collateral once the Obligations have been paid in full and this Agreement has been terminated. (b) Each Loan Party acknowledges that from time to time financial advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to such Loan Party or one or more of its Affiliates (in connection with this Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more Subsidiaries or Affiliates of such Lender and each Loan Party hereby authorizes each Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by such Loan Party and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender, it being understood that any such Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Lender receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of Section 16.15 as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive the repayment of the other Obligations and the termination of the Loan Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the information subject to this Section 16.15 shall not include, and the Agent and each Lender (and their employees or 93
representatives) may disclose to any and all persons without limitation of any kind, any information with respect to the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case, within the meaning of Section 1.6011-4 of the Regulations) of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent or such Lender relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby as well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portion of such document or similar item that relates to the tax treatment or tax structure of the Revolving Advances, Letters of Credit and transactions contemplated hereby. 16.16 Tax Withholding Clause. Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and, upon the written request of the Agent, each other Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender) agrees that it will deliver to each of the Borrowing Agent and the Agent two (2) duly completed appropriate valid Withholding Certificates (as defined under Section 1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax Regulations (the "Regulations")) certifying its status (i.e. U.S. or foreign person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced, or exemption from, U.S. withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or an exemption provided by the Internal Revenue Code. The term "Withholding Certificate" means a Form W-9; a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and certifications as required under Section 1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the Regulations; a statement described in Section 1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the Regulations; or any other certificates under the Internal Revenue Code or Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner as a U.S. or foreign person. Each Lender, assignee or participant required to deliver to the Borrowing Agent and the Agent a Withholding Certificate pursuant to the preceding sentence shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate as follows: (A) each Lender which is a party hereto on the Closing Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable by the Borrowers hereunder for the account of such Lender; (B) each assignee or participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation (unless the Agent in its sole discretion shall permit such assignee or participant to deliver such valid Withholding Certificate less than five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the date specified by the Agent). Each Lender, assignee or participant which so delivers a valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrowing Agent and the Agent two (2) additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor form) on or before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrowing Agent or the Agent. Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Agent shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full 30% withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under Section 1.1441-7(b) of the Regulations. Further, the Agent is indemnified under Section 1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and demands of any Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender 94
for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with regulations under Section 1441 of the Code. 16.17 Publicity. Each Loan Party and each Lender hereby authorizes Agent and each Co-Lead Arranger to make appropriate announcements of the financial arrangement entered into among Loan Parties, Agent and Lenders, including, without limitation, announcements which are commonly known as tombstones, in such publications and to such selected parties as Agent and each Co-Lead Arranger shall in their sole and absolute discretion deem appropriate.
