EXHIBIT INDEX ------------- Exhibit 99.1 Press Release dated October 22, 2003. 4

Exhibit 99.1 Allegheny Technologies Announces Third Quarter Results PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2003--Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) -- Third quarter net loss of $28.8 million, or $0.36 per share -- Results include net non-recurring special charges of $3.0 million, or $0.04 per share -- Results impacted by retirement benefit expense of $20.0 million, or $0.25 per share -- Third quarter cash flow from operations of $35.0 million -- Third quarter cost reductions of $29 million; cost reductions year-to-date of $85 million; on target to achieve $115 million 2003 cost reduction goal Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) reported a net loss of $28.8 million, or $0.36 per share, on sales of $482.6 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003. Retirement benefit expense, primarily non-cash, was again the biggest negative to earnings in the quarter. Continuing weak demand for most of ATI's specialty metals combined with higher raw material, energy, and insurance costs also negatively impacted results in the third quarter. Pat Hassey, ATI's new President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The prolonged weakness in most of our major markets has been challenging. The problems are not only related to the cyclical economy. Global markets and competitors are shaping how we will change to compete. "Our performance for the third quarter is a long way from where we need to be. On the plus side, we generated $35 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. Once again, our operating employees did a good job reducing managed working capital, mainly by reducing inventories. This is quite an achievement in this environment of escalating raw material costs and demonstrates the value of ATI's lean-manufacturing initiatives. "ATI has great opportunities, people and technology. While the past three years have been difficult for all U.S. manufacturing companies, ATI made significant progress in reducing costs and improving liquidity. Now, we cannot wait for the U.S. or world economies to make us better. More needs to be done faster to structure ATI to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities. "Yesterday, we announced executive management organization changes to quickly move ATI forward and focus our joint efforts on building the ATI Business System. Also, we plan additional workforce reductions in the fourth quarter to further reduce costs, improve productivity and streamline our organization."

Sales were up 11% in the High Performance Metals segment and 5% in the Engineered Products segment (formerly known as the Industrial Products segment). Sales were down 2% in the Flat-Rolled Products segment. -- Net loss was $28.8 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to last year's net loss of $7.5 million, or $0.09 per share. Results included net non-recurring special charges of $3.0 million, or $0.04 per share. In the same period in 2002, special charges were $4.5 million, or $0.05 per share. -- Retirement benefit expense, after tax, in the third quarter 2003 was $20.0 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to $3.0 million, or $0.04 per share, in the third quarter 2002. Through nine months, retirement benefit expense was $63.5 million, or $0.78 per share, in 2003 compared to $10.3 million, or $0.13 per share, in 2002. Essentially all of the increase in retirement benefit expense in 2003 compared to 2002 is non-cash. -- Cash flow from operations was $35 million and cash on hand increased to $79 million, mainly as a result of inventory reduction through lean-manufacturing initiatives. -- Cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled $29 million company-wide, bringing cost reductions to $85 million for the nine months. Our 2003 cost reduction goal is $115 million. Flat-Rolled Products Segment Market Conditions -- Demand from the automotive market was stable, while demand from the residential construction and remodeling, and home appliance markets remained strong. Non-residential construction and most capital goods markets remained at low levels of demand. Raw material surcharges escalated during the quarter due to rising LME nickel prices, resulting in higher average transaction prices, although base-selling prices remained essentially flat with the second quarter. Third quarter 2003 compared to third quarter 2002 -- Sales declined 2% to $260.5 million primarily due to continued weakness in non-residential construction and most capital goods markets. Total tons shipped decreased 2%. Average transaction prices were basically flat due to higher raw material surcharges; however, average base selling prices, which do not include surcharges, declined by approximately 5%. -- The segment had an operating loss of $4.8 million compared to an operating profit of $3.9 million last year due to lower base prices, reduced demand, and higher energy and raw material costs, which more than offset lower depreciation expense. -- Energy costs increased $3.1 million compared to 2002, net of approximately $0.2 million in gains from natural gas derivatives. -- Results for the third quarter 2003 benefited from $15 million in cost reductions, before the effects of inflation and higher energy costs, bringing cost reductions to $43 million through nine months. High Performance Metals Segment Market Conditions -- Demand for nickel-based alloys and premium titanium alloys from the commercial aerospace market continued to be weak, while demand was strong from the government defense and biomedical markets. In late September, we announced price increases for this segment's nickel, titanium, and specialty steel alloys, primarily to offset higher costs. Our exotic alloys business had another good quarter and continued to benefit from sustained high demand from government defense and high-energy physics markets. Third quarter 2003 compared to third quarter 2002 -- Sales increased 11% to $162.3 million. Shipments were up 13% for nickel-based and specialty steel alloys, 15% for titanium alloys and 9% for exotic alloys. -- Operating profit improved to $9.5 million compared to $9.3 million due to strong demand for our exotic alloys and benefits from cost reductions, partially offset by higher raw material costs. -- Results for the third quarter 2003 benefited from $11 million of cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, bringing cost reductions to $33 million through nine months. Engineered Products Segment (formerly known as Industrial Products Segment) Market Conditions -- While demand from most markets remained weak, demand for tungsten product materials from the oil and gas market improved. Third quarter 2003 compared to third quarter 2002 -- Sales improved 5% to $59.8 million. -- Operating profit was $1.1 million compared to $1.6 million last year due to higher raw material costs and lower prices, which offset higher sales volumes and the benefits from cost reductions. -- Results for the third quarter 2003 benefited from $2 million of cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, bringing cost reductions to $6 million through nine months. Retirement Benefit Expense -- Pre-tax retirement benefit expense was $33.5 million for the third quarter 2003 compared to $5.4 million for the third quarter 2002. This increase resulted in a $28.1 million pre-tax, or $0.21 per share after-tax, reduction in third quarter 2003 results compared to the same 2002 period. -- Approximately $25.6 million of the third quarter 2003 retirement benefit expense was non-cash. -- The higher retirement benefit expense resulted from the severe decline in the equity markets from 2000 through 2002, lower expected returns on benefit plan investments and a lower discount rate assumption for determining liabilities. -- For the third quarter 2003, retirement benefit expense increased cost of sales by $23.1 million, and selling and administrative expenses by $10.4 million. For the third quarter 2002, retirement benefit expense increased cost of sales by $1.8 million, and selling and administrative expenses by $3.6 million. -- ATI is not required to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan for 2003 and, based upon current actuarial studies, does not expect to be required to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan during the next several years. Special Charges -- Results for the third quarter 2003 included net special charges of $3.0 million after-tax, or $0.04 per share. These amounts included: -- $3.5 million associated with the previously announced termination of the Stock Acquisition and Retention Program, which generated approximately $0.5 million in cash for ATI, and $1.1 million related to CEO transition. These charges are included in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. -- $0.8 million, or $0.01 per share, of restructuring costs associated with workforce reductions across ATI during the 2003 third quarter. -- $2.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of interest income related to a Federal income tax settlement associated with prior years. This interest income is netted against interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. -- Results for the third quarter 2002 included net after-tax charges of $4.5 million, or $0.05 per share, for salaried workforce reductions and a non-cash charge related to ATI's minority interest in New Piper Aircraft, Inc. Other Expenses -- Corporate expenses for the third quarter 2003 decreased to $4.1 million compared to $5.6 million in the year-ago period primarily due to savings at the corporate office associated with reductions in staffing and other efforts to control costs, partially offset by higher insurance costs. -- The effective tax rate was a benefit of 40.4% and 37.6% for the 2003 third quarter and nine months, respectively, compared to 44.9% and 38.0% for the same periods of 2002. The effective tax rate for the third quarter 2003 was favorably impacted by the settlement of previous years' tax obligations. As a result of this settlement, ATI will receive in the 2003 fourth quarter a tax refund of $17.1 million, including interest. ATI continues to evaluate the future realization of its deferred tax assets. Cash Flow and Working Capital -- Cash on hand was $78.5 million at September 30, 2003, an increase of $19.1 million from 2002 year-end. -- Cash flow from operating activities for the 2003 third quarter was $35.0 million, and for the first nine months of 2003 was $52.1 million. -- At September 30, 2003, managed working capital was 30.6% of annualized sales compared to 32.4% of annualized sales at 2002 year-end. We define managed working capital as accounts receivable and gross inventories less accounts payable. -- Managed working capital decreased $18.0 million in the third quarter 2003, primarily due to reduced inventories. However, managed working capital increased $36.2 million in the first nine months of 2003 resulting primarily from an increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales in the 2003 third quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2002, and higher gross inventories, mostly as a result of higher raw material costs, primarily nickel. The increase in raw material costs is expected to be largely recovered through surcharges. -- Capital expenditures were $51.5 million for the first nine months of 2003. -- Cash provided by financing activities was $14.0 million in the first nine months of 2003 and included proceeds of $15.3 million on the termination of certain interest rate swap arrangements, primarily in the first quarter 2003, proceeds from a net increase in debt of $13.3 million, primarily from capital project financing, less $14.6 million of dividend payments. -- There are no borrowings currently outstanding under ATI's $325 million secured borrowing facility, although a portion of the letters of credit capacity is being utilized. New Accounting Pronouncement The adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143") resulted in an after-tax charge of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per share in the 2003 first quarter. This charge is reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
