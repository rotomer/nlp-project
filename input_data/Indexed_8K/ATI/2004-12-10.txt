ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On December 9, 2004, the board of directors of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (the "Company") (1) approved an increase in the annual retainer fee payable to non-employee members of the board of directors for services they render to the Company, (2) adopted stock ownership guidelines for board members; and (3) froze and discontinued the Company's Fee Continuation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Beginning in January 2005, the annual retainer fee payable by the Company to its non-employee directors was increased to $60,000 per year. In taking this action, the board encouraged directors to obtain a meaningful stock ownership interest in the Company. Under the terms of the Company's Non-Employee Director Stock Compensation Plan, each non-employee director receives at least 25% of the annual retainer fee in the form of Allegheny Technologies Common Stock and/or options to acquire Common Stock. The Board also determined that directors will be expected to own shares of Common Stock of the Company having a market value of at least two times the annual retainer amount within five years, or within five years of first becoming a director, whichever occurs first, and at least three times the annual retainer amount within a reasonable time thereafter. In terminating the Fee Continuation Plan, the board froze the amount payable under the plan. Under the frozen plan, an amount equal to the annual retainer fee in effect for 2004 will be paid for each year of the current director's credited service as a director (as defined in the Plan) up to a maximum of ten years. Previously, the annual benefit amount equaled the retainer fee in effect when the director retired from the Board. The amounts payable were approved by the board of directors, but except for the Fee Continuation Plan, are not set forth in any written agreements between the non-employee directors and the Company.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
