Exhibit 99.1 Allegheny Technologies Expects Strong Fourth Quarter 2004 Results PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 18, 2005--Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) said today that it expects fourth quarter 2004 earnings to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.37 per share. The Company plans to release its fourth quarter and full-year 2004 results before the market opens on January 31, 2005. "Our projected fourth quarter 2004 results are due primarily to better than expected operating results in our Flat-Rolled Products and High Performance Metals segments," said Pat Hassey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny Technologies. "Fourth quarter 2004 results benefited from operating efficiencies and cost reductions, which were enhanced by the successful integration of this past summer's stainless steel asset acquisition and our upgraded high performance metals rolling mill. The fourth quarter 2004 results include a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of approximately $30 million due to higher raw materials costs. Looking ahead, we continue to be optimistic about 2005." ATI plans to provide more information on its fourth quarter 2004 earnings and its outlook for 2005 in the Company's earnings news release. ATI will provide live Internet listening access to its conference call scheduled for January 31, 2005, at 1 p.m. ET. The conference call will be broadcast at www.alleghenytechnologies.com.
