Exhibit 99.1 Allegheny Technologies Announces Dividend Increase, 2006 Capital Plan and Voluntary Pension Contribution PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 9, 2005--Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) today announced actions designed to continue to increase shareholder value: -- The Board of Directors increased ATI's quarterly dividend by 67% to $0.10 per share. -- Capital investments for 2006 are expected to approximate $225 million, primarily aimed at growing ATI's high-value product capabilities. -- ATI made a $100 million voluntary contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. "Our major end markets remain strong, and we are well-positioned to fully achieve ATI's opportunities in 2006 and beyond," said L. Patrick Hassey, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. "We are confident in ATI's ability to continue to generate strong cash flow over the next several years. The actions announced today are aimed at enhancing shareholder value over the near-term and long-term by increasing shareholder return, improving ATI's balance sheet, and continuing to invest for profitable growth." Details of today's announcement: 1. The Allegheny Technologies Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock.
