EXHIBIT INDEX ------------- Exhibit 99.1 Press release dated July 26, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1 Allegheny Technologies Announces Strong Profitable Growth in Second Quarter 2006 PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 26, 2006--Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI): -- Sales increased 34% to over $1.2 billion -- Net income increased 53% to $140.4 million, or $1.37 per share -- Segment operating profit increased 78% to $253 million, or 21% of sales: -- High Performance Metals: 34.5% of sales -- Flat-Rolled Products: 12.6% of sales -- Engineered Products: 13.8% of sales -- Results include LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $45 million and one-time $10 million tax benefit -- Year-to-date gross cost reductions of $62 million -- Annualized return on capital employed of 34% -- Annualized return on stockholders' equity of 52% -- Net debt to total capitalization improved to 18.6% -- Cash on hand was $313 million Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) reported net income for the second quarter 2006 of $140.4 million, or $1.37 per share, on sales of $1.21 billion. Income before tax for the second quarter 2006 was $203.5 million. In the second quarter 2005, ATI reported net income of $91.7 million, or $0.91 per share, on sales of $904.2 million. Income before tax in the second quarter 2005 was $94.7 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, income before tax was $363.7 million, and net income was $242.9 million, or $2.38 per share, on sales of $2.25 billion. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, income before tax was $158.0 million, and net income was $152.7 million, or $1.53 per share, on sales of $1.78 billion. "ATI continued to demonstrate strong profitable growth results and future earnings power," said L. Patrick Hassey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Sales grew by 34% compared to the second quarter 2005 and were 16% higher than the first quarter 2006. Income before tax more than doubled to $203.5 million. Net income increased by 53% to $140.4 million. "Segment operating profit reached 21% of sales as operational execution continued to improve. Operating profit in our High Performance Metals segment was nearly 35% of sales. In our Flat-Rolled Products segment, operating profit improved to nearly 13% of sales. Operating profit in our Engineered Products segment was just under 14% of sales. These outstanding results were accomplished with a total LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $45 million due to higher raw material costs, particularly for nickel, nickel-bearing scrap and titanium alloy scrap. Continued unusual volatility in the cost of these raw materials has the potential to drive LIFO charges in the second half of 2006 higher than in the first half of this year. "Each of our business units is hitting on all cylinders and each unit is implementing aggressive growth initiatives. Our key growth markets, namely aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical, remain strong, representing just over 63% of ATI's year-to-date 2006 sales. Aerospace and defense was the largest of our markets at 31% of year-to-date 2006 sales. "Our cash flow continued to support our self-funded growth strategy. Capital investments in the first half of 2006 totaled $102 million, 82% of which were directed towards increasing our high-value products capabilities. We also invested $331 million in managed working capital through the first two quarters of 2006 due to significantly higher sales and operating levels. We expect managed working capital to be relatively flat in the third quarter 2006 and to moderately increase in the fourth quarter 2006 as we bring on our new high-value products capabilities. "Key financial ratios were very strong in the second quarter 2006. Managed working capital as a percentage of annualized sales remained near all-time lows at just under 28%. Annualized return on capital employed was 34%, annualized return on stockholders' equity was 52%, and net debt to total capitalization improved to 18.6%. "We remain focused on reducing costs in 2006 and achieved gross cost reductions of $34 million in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date cost reductions to $62 million. Our 2006 cost reduction target is $100 million. "Our strategic investments for growth in titanium and titanium alloys, and nickel-based alloys and superalloys are on track. Phase I of our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility is now fully operational and is expected to be producing sponge at an annualized rate of 7.5 million pounds in the second half of 2006. Albany Phase II and Phase III are progressing. In addition, in June we announced our Board's approval of a greenfield titanium sponge facility in Utah. Our titanium melt expansion projects are also progressing. New nickel-based alloy remelt furnaces at our Latrobe, PA and Lockport, NY facilities were successfully started in July. We continue to expect increased mill product shipments of our high-value products from these strategic investments beginning in the fourth quarter 2006. "This step-up in ATI's production capacity is well-timed. Discussions with existing and new customers last week during the Farnborough Air Show confirm a significant step-up in demand for ATI's titanium and nickel-based superalloy products from the aerospace and defense market. Our outlook for growth in aerospace and defense has further strengthened. Demand also remains strong for these products from the medical, oil and gas, and other capital goods markets. "Looking ahead, we see no seasonal slowing in the third quarter. Demand from our key markets, namely aerospace and defense, chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and medical, remains very strong for our high performance metals and flat-rolled products. Recent price increases for our flat-rolled stainless products are further evidence of the continued strength in the markets for these products." Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30 June 30 In Millions ----------------------------------------------- 2006 2005 2006 2005 ----------- ----------- ----------- ----------- Sales $1,210.8 $904.2 $2,251.3 $1,783.8 Net income $140.4 $91.7 $242.9 $152.7 Per Diluted Share ----------------------------------------------- Net income $1.37 $0.91 $2.38 $1.53 Second Quarter 2006 Financial Highlights -- Sales were a record $1.21 billion, 34% higher than the second quarter 2005, and 16% higher than the first quarter 2006. Compared to the second quarter 2005, sales increased 49% in the High Performance Metals segment, 30% in the Flat-Rolled Products segment, and 9% in the Engineered Products segment. Compared to the first quarter 2006, sales increased 9% in the High Performance Metals segment, 26% in the Flat-Rolled Products segment, and were essentially the same in the Engineered Products segment. -- Segment operating profit was a record $252.7 million, an increase of $110.9 million, or 78%, compared to the second quarter 2005, and 21% higher than the first quarter 2006, as a result of improved performance across all three business segments. Second quarter 2006 results included a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $45.5 million, due primarily to higher nickel, nickel-bearing scrap, and titanium scrap raw material costs. The LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge was $26.4 million in the second quarter 2005 and $6.9 million in the first quarter 2006. -- Net income was $140.4 million, or $1.37 per share, compared to $91.7 million, or $0.91 per share, in the second quarter 2005. Results for the second quarter 2006 included a provision for income taxes of $63.1 million, or 31% of income before tax, which benefited from a $10.2 million reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance due to the expected future realization of state income tax credits. The second quarter 2005 provision for income taxes was $3.0 million, or 3.2% of income before tax, and benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets. -- Cash flow from operations for the 2006 first half was $29.6 million as improved operating earnings more than offset a further investment of $331.2 million in managed working capital. -- Cash on hand was $313.2 million at the end of the second quarter 2006. -- Gross cost reductions, before the effects of inflation, totaled $62.3 million company-wide for the 2006 first half. Our 2006 gross cost reduction goal is $100 million. High Performance Metals Segment Market Conditions -- Demand for our titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum-melted specialty alloys was robust from the aerospace and defense market and strong from the medical, and oil and gas markets. Demand was strong for our exotic alloys from the global chemical process industry markets and from the aerospace and defense, medical, and electrical energy markets. Second quarter 2006 compared to second quarter 2005 -- Sales increased 49% to a record $450.2 million. Shipments increased 7% for titanium and titanium alloys and 13% for nickel-based and specialty alloys and declined 11% for exotic alloys due primarily to product mix. Average selling prices increased 64% for titanium and titanium alloys, 22% for nickel-based and specialty alloys, and 8% for exotic alloys. -- Segment operating profit reached a record $155.2 million, or 34.5% of sales, a $78.6 million increase compared to the second quarter 2005. The significant increase in operating profit primarily resulted from increased shipments for most products, higher selling prices, and the benefits of gross cost reductions, partially offset by start-up expenses of $2.5 million associated with our Albany, OR titanium sponge facility. In addition, raw material cost inflation and higher inventory levels resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $18.5 million in the second quarter 2006, compared to a $17.3 million charge in the second quarter 2005. -- Results benefited from $6.8 million of gross cost reductions. Flat-Rolled Products Segment Market Conditions -- Total second quarter 2006 shipments were a record 379.2 million pounds, an increase of 28% compared to the second quarter 2005 and 21% compared to the first quarter 2006. Demand was strong for our stainless products from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, and electrical energy markets and from service center customers. Demand was also strong for our specialty stainless, grain-oriented silicon, and nickel-based alloy products from the chemical process industry, oil and gas, electrical energy, and aerospace and defense markets. Second quarter 2006 compared to second quarter 2005 -- Sales were $650.8 million, 30% higher than the second quarter 2005, as a result of a 28% increase in pounds shipped, higher base-selling prices for many products and improved product mix. Average transaction prices, which include surcharges, were 5% higher. -- Segment operating profit increased to $82.3 million, or 12.6% of sales, primarily as a result of increased shipments, improved product mix, higher selling prices, and the benefits of gross cost reductions. This was accomplished in spite of significantly higher LIFO inventory valuation reserve charges due primarily to higher nickel and nickel-bearing scrap raw material costs. This resulted in a LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge of $27.0 million in the second quarter 2006, compared to a $3.9 million charge in the second quarter 2005. -- Results benefited from $25.9 million in gross cost reductions. Engineered Products Segment Market Conditions -- Demand for our tungsten and tungsten carbide products was strong from the oil and gas, power generation, and medical markets. Demand was strong for our forged products from the Class 8 truck, construction and mining, and oil and gas markets. Demand for our cast products was strong from the transportation, wind energy, and oil and gas markets. Demand remained very strong for our titanium precision metal processing conversion services. Second quarter 2006 compared to second quarter 2005 -- Sales increased to $109.8 million, 9% higher than the second quarter 2005, due to increased volume and higher selling prices. -- Segment operating profit improved to $15.2 million, or 13.8% of sales, primarily due to lower raw material cost inflation and the benefits of gross cost reductions. No LIFO inventory valuation reserve charge was recorded in the second quarter 2006, compared to a $5.2 million charge in the second quarter 2005. -- Results benefited from $1.4 million of gross cost reductions. Retirement Benefit Expense -- Retirement benefit expense was $20.3 million in the second quarter 2006, compared to $20.0 million in the second quarter 2005. -- For the second quarter 2006, retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales was $14.0 million and in selling and administrative expenses was $6.3 million. For the second quarter 2005, the amount of retirement benefit expense included in cost of sales was $14.1 million, and the amount included in selling and administrative expenses was $5.9 million. Other Expenses -- Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 6.2% in the 2006 second quarter from 7.2% in the same period of 2005. -- Corporate expenses for the second quarter 2006 were $18.0 million, compared to $11.6 million in the year-ago period. This increase was due to expenses associated with annual and long-term performance-based incentive compensation programs. -- Second quarter 2006 interest expense, net of interest income, decreased to $5.8 million from $10.6 million in the year-ago period primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances and capitalization of interest costs on strategic capital projects, partially offset by higher interest rates on floating rate debt. Income Taxes Results for the second quarter 2006 included a provision for income taxes of $63.1 million, or 31.0% of income before tax, for U.S. Federal, foreign and state income taxes. The second quarter 2006 benefited from the elimination of a $10.2 million deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to certain state tax credits expected to be realized in future periods. For the remainder of 2006 and future periods, we expect that our effective tax rate will return to a more normal percentage rate such as that reflected in our first quarter 2006 results. The second quarter 2005 included a provision of $3.0 million, or 3.2% of income before tax, principally related to foreign and state income taxes. Prior to the fourth quarter 2005, we maintained a valuation allowance for a major portion of our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", due to uncertainty regarding full utilization of our net deferred tax asset, including the 2003 and 2004 unutilized net operating losses. In 2005, we generated taxable income which exceeded the 2003 and 2004 net operating losses, allowing us to fully realize these U.S. Federal tax benefits. This realization of tax benefits, together with our improved profitability, required us to eliminate the remaining valuation allowance for U.S. Federal income taxes in the fourth quarter 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Cash Flow, Working Capital and Debt -- Cash on hand was $313.2 million at the end of the second quarter 2006, a decrease of $49.3 million from year end 2005. -- Cash flow from operations during the 2006 first half was $29.6 million as improved operating earnings were largely offset by a further investment of $331.2 million in managed working capital and payment of previously accrued litigation costs of $37.5 million. -- The investment in managed working capital resulted from a $117.8 million increase in accounts receivable, which reflects the significantly higher level of sales in the second quarter 2006 compared to the fourth quarter 2005, and a $296.3 million increase in inventory mostly as a result of increased operating volumes and higher raw material costs, partially offset by a $82.9 million increase in accounts payable. Most of the increase in raw material costs is expected to be recovered through surcharge and index pricing mechanisms. -- At June 30, 2006, managed working capital improved to 27.7% of annualized sales, compared to 30.3% of annualized sales at year-end 2005. We define managed working capital as accounts receivable plus gross inventories less accounts payable. -- Cash used in investing activities was $100.5 million in the 2006 first half and consisted primarily of capital expenditures. -- Cash provided by financing activities was $21.4 million in the 2006 first half as $27.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits on share-based compensation of $16.5 million more than offset dividend payments of $20.0 million and a reduction in borrowings of $2.4 million. -- Net debt as a percentage of total capitalization improved to 18.6% at the end of the second quarter 2006, compared to 19.8% at the end of 2005. -- There were no borrowings outstanding during the 2006 first half or all of 2005 under ATI's $325 million secured domestic borrowing facility, although a portion of the letters of credit capacity was utilized during both periods.
