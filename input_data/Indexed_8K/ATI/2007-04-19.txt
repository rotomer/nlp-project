Item 8.01. Other Events.
     As required, and as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, in the first quarter 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff ("FASB") Position titled "Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities" ("FSP PMMA"). The FSP PMMA prohibits the use of the accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities, which is the policy the Company had used to record planned plant outage costs on an interim basis within a fiscal year, and also to record the costs of major equipment rebuilds which extend the life of capital equipment. Under the FSP PMMA, the Company now reports results using the deferral method whereby major equipment rebuilds are capitalized as costs are incurred and amortized to expense over the estimated useful lives, and planned plant outage costs are fully recognized in the interim period of the outage. In addition under the FSP PMMA, the Company is required to restate its financial statements for prior periods as if the FSP PMMA had been applied to the earliest presented.
     The following consolidated statements of income and business segment information for 2006 reflecting this retrospective application of the FSP PMMA are filed as part of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
