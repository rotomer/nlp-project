Exhibit 99.1
This notice is to inform you of significant restrictions on your ability to trade any equity securities of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (the "Company") during an upcoming "blackout period" that will apply to the Company's 401(k) Savings Plans (the "401(k) Plans"). This special "blackout period" is imposed on executive officers and directors of the Company by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR (Blackout Trading Restriction) and is in addition to the Company's trading windows related to its earnings releases.
The special blackout period is being imposed because of the introduction of new investment options and features to the 401(k) Plans. The special blackout period will begin at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on August 23, 2007 and is expected to end during the week of September 17, 2007 (the "Blackout Period"). During the Blackout Period, participants in the 401(k) Plans will not be able to process any account transactions.
In accordance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Rule 104 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation BTR, the Company's directors and executive officers are prohibited during the Blackout Period from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring, directly or indirectly, any equity security of the Company acquired in connection with his or her employment as an executive officer or services as a director.
Please note the following:
Inquiries with respect to this blackout period, including determining whether this blackout period has ended, should be directed to:
 
Jon D. Walton Executive Vice President, Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary Allegheny Technologies Incorporated 1000 Six PPG Place Pittsburgh, PA 15222-5479 (412) 394-2800
These rules apply in addition to the trading restrictions under the Company's insider trading policy. If you engage in a transaction that violates these rules, you may be required to disgorge your profits from the transaction, and you may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
The SEC regulations regarding the Blackout Period restrictions are complex. To avoid any inadvertent violations of the Blackout Period restrictions, directors and executive officers are required to follow the Company's pre-clearance procedures in connection with any proposed transaction in Company securities. If you have any questions regarding the Company's pre-clearance procedures or your ability to engage in any transaction, please contact Jon Walton.
