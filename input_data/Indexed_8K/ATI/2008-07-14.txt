Pittsburgh, PA, July 14, 2008  Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) expects second quarter 2008 earnings to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.67 per share, including a $0.11 per share one-time net tax benefit. ATI had previously said that it expected second quarter earnings to be somewhat higher than the $1.40 per share achieved in the first quarter 2008.
