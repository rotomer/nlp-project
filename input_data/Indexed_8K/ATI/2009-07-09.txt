Exhibit 99.1
Allegheny Technologies Announces Voluntary Contribution to U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Impact of Non-Recurring Costs Associated with Second Quarter 2009 Capital Market Transactions
PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 9, 2009--Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) announced that it made a voluntary $350 million cash contribution to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan in June 2009 to significantly improve the plans funded position. A portion of the net proceeds from ATIs June 2009 $402.5 million issuance of 4.25% five-year convertible notes were used to make this voluntary contribution. The $350 million voluntary contribution was made as a 2008 plan year contribution for income tax reporting purposes. As a result of the voluntary contribution, 2009 pension expense is expected to be reduced by $27.5 million to $98.7 million. This reduction will be reflected ratably over the last seven months of 2009.
Also in June 2009, ATI issued $350 million of new 9.375% senior notes due in June 2019 and completed a tender offer for the retirement of $183.3 million of the Companys 8.375% notes due in December 2011, which leaves $116.7 million of the 2011 notes outstanding.
As a result of the impact of the pension trust contribution on prior years tax provisions and the costs associated with the retirement of $183.3 million of the 2011 notes, ATI expects to recognize non-recurring after-tax charges of $17.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the second quarter 2009. Excluding these non-recurring charges, ATI expects second quarter 2009 earnings per share to be approximately $0.03.
ATI will provide live internet listening access to its conference call with investors and analysts scheduled for July 22, 2009 at 1:00 p.m. ET. The conference call will be conducted after the Companys planned release of second quarter 2009 results. The conference call will be broadcast at . To access the broadcast, go to the home page and select Conference Call. Replay of the conference call will be available on the Allegheny Technologies website.
