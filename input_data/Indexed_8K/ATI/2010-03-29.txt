Exhibit 99.1
Allegheny Technologies Announces First Quarter 2010 Tax Charge as a Result of U.S. Healthcare Legislation
PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2010--Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) reported today that it expects to record a one-time, non-cash tax charge of approximately $5 million, or $0.05 per share, in the first quarter 2010 as a result of the recently-enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed by the President on March 23, 2010, and the subsequent modifications made in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 passed by Congress on March 25, 2010.
Under the new legislation, the tax-advantaged subsidy to encourage companies to provide retiree prescription drug coverage has been eliminated. Although the elimination of this tax advantage under the new legislation does not take effect until 2013, ATI is required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to recognize the full accounting impact in the period in which the Act is passed by Congress and signed by the President. Since future anticipated retiree health care liabilities and related tax subsidies are already reflected in ATIs financial statements, the change in law results in a reduction of the value of the Companys deferred tax asset related to the subsidy. This reduction in value is expected to create a $5 million one-time, non-cash charge to ATIs earnings in the first quarter 2010.
