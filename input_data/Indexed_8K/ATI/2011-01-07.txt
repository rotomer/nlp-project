     On January 7, 2011, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (the "Company") completed its offering and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.950% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Notes"). The offering and sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated June 1, 2009 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated January 7, 2011 (the "Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee.
     The Notes will accrue interest at the rate of 5.950% per annum, with interest payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15, commencing July 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2021.
     The Company may redeem the Notes, at any time and from time to time, prior to October 15, 2020, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest with respect to the Notes being redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis plus a "make-whole" premium, in either case plus accrued interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. On and after October 15, 2020, the Company may redeem the Notes, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed to the redemption date. If the Company undergoes a change of control repurchase event, holders may request that the Company repurchase the Notes, in whole or in part, for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date. If the Company does not consummate its acquisition of Ladish & Co., Inc. on or prior to June 30, 2011 or if the merger agreement related to that acquisition is terminated on or prior to June 30, 2011, the Company will redeem 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes on a pro rata basis at a redemption price equal to 102% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of initial issuance to the redemption date.
     If an event of default with respect to the Notes occurs, the principal amount of the Notes, plus premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest may be declared immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions. These amounts automatically become due and payable in the case of certain types of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events of default involving the Company.
     The foregoing is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, and is not a complete discussion. Accordingly, the foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. The Indenture was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 3, 2010, and such exhibit is incorporated herein by reference. The
 
Supplemental Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 5.1
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated 1000 Six PPG Place Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222
Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as your counsel in connection with the issuance and sale by Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.950% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated January 4, 2011, among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the "Underwriters"). The Notes are being offered and sold to the Underwriters in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
     The following documents are referred to collectively in this opinion letter as the "Transaction Documents":
     In connection with rendering the opinions set forth below, we have examined (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-159479) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 26, 2009, relating to an unspecified aggregate initial offering price or number of securities of the Company; (ii) the Prospectus, dated May 26, 2009, as supplemented by the accompanying Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, dated January 4, 2011, relating to the Notes, as filed with the Commission on January 4, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, including all material incorporated by reference therein; (iii) the Final Term Sheet relating to the Notes, as filed with the Commission on January 5, 2011 pursuant to Rule 433 under the Securities Act; (iv) the Prospectus, dated May 26, 2009, as supplemented by the accompanying Prospectus Supplement, dated January 4, 2011, reflecting the final terms of the Notes and the terms of the offering
 
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated January 7, 2011 Page 2
thereof, as filed with the Commission on January 5, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, including all material incorporated by reference therein (the "Prospectus"); (v) the Transaction Documents; (vi) the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws; and (vii) resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes by the Company. We have made such other investigation as we have deemed appropriate.
     For the purposes of this opinion letter, we further have made the assumptions that (i) each document submitted to us is accurate and complete; (ii) each such document that is an original is authentic; (iii) each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original; and (iv) all signatures (other than signatures on behalf of the Company) on each such document are genuine. We also have assumed for purposes of this opinion letter (i) the legal capacity of natural persons; (ii) that each party to each of the Transaction Documents (other than the Company) has the legal capacity or authority and has satisfied all legal requirements that are applicable to that party to the extent necessary to make each Transaction Document to which it is a party enforceable against it; and (iii) that each party to each of the Transaction Documents has complied with all state and federal statutes, rules and regulations applicable to it arising out of the transactions set forth in the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. We have not verified any of the foregoing assumptions.
     The opinions expressed in this opinion letter are limited to (i) the laws of the State of New York, other than its law relating to choice of law, (ii) applicable federal securities laws of the United States and (iii) the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. We are not opining on, and we assume no responsibility for, the applicability to or effect on any of the matters covered herein of any other laws, the laws of any county, municipality or other political subdivision or local governmental agency or authority.
     Based on and subject to the foregoing and to the additional qualifications and other matters set forth below, it is our opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized, executed and delivered and, when authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits set forth in the Indenture (subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors or secured parties generally, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with general principles of equity (whether applied by a court of law or equity)).
     We express no opinion as to any provision in the Notes: (i) that purports to release, exculpate or exempt a party from, or require indemnification or contribution of a party for, liability for its own negligence or misconduct; (ii) that purports to allow any party to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the business of another party; (iii) the effect of which is governed by the law of a jurisdiction other than the State of New York, the applicable federal securities laws of the United States or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware;
 
Allegheny Technologies Incorporated January 7, 2011 Page 3
(iv) that purports to require any party to pay any amounts due to another party without a reasonable accounting of the sums purported to be due; (v) that purports to prohibit the assignment of rights that may be assigned pursuant to applicable law regardless of an agreement not to assign such rights; (vi) that purports to require that amendments to any agreement be in writing; (vii) relating to powers of attorney, severability or set-off; (viii) that purports to restrict access exclusively to any particular courts; and (ix) providing that decisions by a party are conclusive or may be made in its sole discretion.
     This opinion is limited to the matters stated in this letter, and no opinions may be implied or inferred beyond the matters expressly stated in this letter. This opinion is being given as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update or supplement any of our opinions to reflect any changes of law or fact that may occur.
     We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, the incorporation by reference of this opinion into the Registration Statement and the reference to this firm under the heading "Legal matters" in the Prospectus forming a part thereof. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act.
Yours truly,
/s/ K&L Gates LLP
