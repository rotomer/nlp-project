Item 8.01 Other Events.
In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments to financial accounting standards related to the presentation of comprehensive income which requires entities to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. These amendments, with retrospective application, are effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal year 2012. Set forth below are consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated ("ATI") for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Other than the change in presentation, these changes did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
