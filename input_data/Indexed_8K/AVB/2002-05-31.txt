Item 4.    Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
                On May 29, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP ("Arthur Andersen") was dismissed and Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") was engaged as the principal independent accountant for AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company").  The decision to change accountants was recommended by the Company's Audit Committee and unanimously approved by the Company's Board of Directors.
 
                The reports of Arthur Andersen on the financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
 
                During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the subsequent interim period through May 29, 2002, there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Arthur Andersen, would have caused Arthur Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports.  None of the reportable events described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, or the subsequent interim period through May 29, 2002.
 
                The Company has provided Arthur Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures.  Attached as Exhibit 16.1 is a letter from Arthur Andersen, dated May 31, 2002, stating their agreement with such statements.
 
                During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the subsequent interim period through May 29, 2002, Ernst & Young has not been engaged as an independent accountant to audit either the Company's financial statements or the financial statements of any of its consolidated subsidiaries, nor has Ernst & Young been consulted regarding the application of the Company's accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events listed in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
