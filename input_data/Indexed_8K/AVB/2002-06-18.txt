Item 9.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On June 18, 2002, representatives of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. will make a presentation in the evening to current and prospective stockholders and other persons and institutions who may be interested in AvalonBay and its business, finances, or securities.  The materials attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 disclose in all material respects the presentation that will be made on June 18, 2002.
 
AvalonBay is furnishing the information included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report pursuant to Regulation FD.  This information is being furnished pursuant to Item 9 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by AvalonBay under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.  This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information in the report that is required to be disclosed solely by Regulation FD.
 
The presentation material is dated June 18, 2002, and the information and analyses presented should be read as of such date with the understanding that AvalonBay is not undertaking to update this presentation material or the third party data and projections included in this presentation material.
 
 
This filing contains projections and statements regarding trends, both nationally and regionally, in the general economy and in the multifamily real estate industry. By their nature, there can be no assurance as to how accurate these projections will be, and other observers of the economy and the multifamily real estate industry could discern different trends or draw different conclusions from these trends. This report includes data and projections prepared by third parties. AvalonBay does not endorse or confirm such data and projections and is not suggesting that the sources of those projections are experts. Additional cautions apply to data and projections prepared by third parties because AvalonBay cannot independently verify these data and projections. In general, it is unlikely that any two analysts would produce identical data and projections.
 
This filing, including the exhibits, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "forecast," and other similar expressions (and abbreviations for such expressions, such as "E" for estimate) that predict or indicate future events and trends.  In addition, statements that do not relate to the reporting of historical matters and that do not report facts about present matters are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are subject to many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include the following:
 
 - 
                 
both generally and in our markets, demand for apartment homes may change, economic conditions (including employment and income levels) may change, and competition (including an increase in the supply of apartments) and competitive pricing may increase, and these changes could affect our occupancy and rental rates;
 - 
                 
projections regarding population, income, employment, household formation and other trends could prove to be wrong, or the suggested effect of such trends could prove to be wrong, and therefore investors should be cautious in relying on the analyses of such trends that are presented in this report;
 - 
                 
we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;
 - 
                 
we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital, all of which make development less desirable;
 - 
                 
construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;
 - 
                 
we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest expense and construction costs and reduced rental revenues;
 - 
                 
financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flow from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline and could limit our pursuit of opportunities;
 - 
                 
our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; and
 - 
                 
we may be unsuccessful in managing our current growth in the number of apartment communities.
 
Additional risks and uncertainties affecting the Company are detailed in AvalonBay's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including AvalonBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in that report and in subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.
 
Readers should review this presentation in conjunction with a review of AvalonBay's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

$140 Million Value Creation
 
[Supplemental Note:  The statement regarding value creation describes AvalonBay's estimate of the current fair market value of the eight communities completed in the Washington, D.C. area in the last six years minus their original cost of construction and development.  The "yield" referred to above is AvalonBay's determination of community-level earnings achieved for the first stabilized year of operations following the completion of construction (before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items, and after taking into account operating expenses for the community but not a management fee or any allocation of corporate overhead), divided by the cost of construction.  Yield, and the components used to calculate yield, are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the method for determining yield used by other REITs could differ.]
