Item 9.  Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On June 19, 2002, representatives of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. will make a presentation in the afternoon to current and prospective stockholders and other persons and institutions who may be interested in AvalonBay and its business, finances, or securities.  The materials attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 disclose in all material respects the presentation that will be made on June 19, 2002.
 
AvalonBay is furnishing the information included in this report pursuant to Regulation FD.  This information is being furnished pursuant to Item 9 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section and will not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by AvalonBay under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.  This report will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information in the report that is required to be disclosed solely by Regulation FD.
 
The presentation material is dated June 19, 2002, and the information and analyses presented should be read as of such date with the understanding that AvalonBay is not undertaking to update this presentation material or the third party data and projections included in this presentation material.
 
 
This filing contains projections and statements regarding trends, both nationally and regionally, in the general economy and in the multifamily real estate industry. By their nature, there can be no assurance as to how accurate these projections will be, and other observers of the economy and the multifamily real estate industry could discern different trends or draw different conclusions from these trends. This report includes data and projections prepared by third parties. AvalonBay does not endorse or confirm such data and projections and is not suggesting that the sources of those projections are experts. Additional cautions apply to data and projections prepared by third parties because AvalonBay cannot independently verify these data and projections. In general, it is unlikely that any two analysts would produce identical data and projections.
 
This filing, including the exhibits, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "forecast," and other similar expressions (and abbreviations for such expressions, such as "E" for estimate) that predict or indicate future events and trends.  In addition, statements that do not relate to the reporting of historical matters and that do not report facts about present matters are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this presentation are subject to many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include the following:
 
 - 
                 
both generally and in our markets, demand for apartment homes may change, economic conditions (including employment and income levels) may change, and competition (including an increase in the supply of apartments) and competitive pricing may increase, and these changes could affect our occupancy and rental rates;
 - 
                 
projections regarding population, income, employment, household formation and other trends could prove to be wrong, or the suggested effect of such trends could prove to be wrong, and therefore investors should be cautious in relying on the analyses of such trends that are presented in this report;
 - 
                 
we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;
 - 
                 
we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital, all of which make development less desirable;
 - 
                 
construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;
 - 
                 
we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest expense and construction costs and reduced rental revenues;
 - 
                 
financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flow from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline and could limit our pursuit of opportunities;
 - 
                 
our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; and
 - 
                 
we may be unsuccessful in managing our current growth in the number of apartment communities.
 
Additional risks and uncertainties affecting the Company are detailed in AvalonBay's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including AvalonBay's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in that report and in subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.
 
Readers should review this presentation in conjunction with a review of AvalonBay's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

Slide 11
:
Planned Evolution
 
 
(3)  Multifamily average consists of 15 publicly traded multifamily companies.  FFO per share obtained from individual company reports was adjusted to conform to NAREIT's definition where appropriate.
 
[Management generally considers Funds from Operations (FFO) to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of AvalonBay because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of AvalonBay to incur and service debt and to makes capital expenditures.  FFO is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), which may differ from the methodology for computing FFO used by other REITs, and, accordingly, AvalonBay's calculation of FFO may not be comparable to the FFO reported by other REITs.  FFO as used by AvalonBay means net income or loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except that excluded from net income or loss are gains or losses on sales of property and extraordinary (as defined by GAAP) gains or losses on debt restructuring; plus depreciation of real estate assets; and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.  Therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.  FFO should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity.  Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.]

[NAV means Estimated Net Asset Value, which is the estimated market value of a company's assets less all current and long-term liabilities divided by the number of outstanding common shares and operating partnership units.  The calculation of estimated NAV by others may not be comparable to the calculation prepared by Green Street Advisors, Inc.]

:
[See the slide of the same title in Exhibit 99.2.  The chart presents data about AvalonBay.  Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.  Economic occupancy is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss (i.e. vacant units at market rents) as a percentage of total possible revenue.  Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at market rents.]

Portfolio Diversification:
AvalonBay's Markets:  Ranked by Sharpe Ratio
 
[Management discussed that it considers the "Sharpe" ratio of each of its markets when considering capital allocation.  The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the excess return of an investment over the "risk free" return, divided by the volatility (measured by the standard deviation of the return) of the investment.  The markets with the highest Sharpe ratio were Fairfield County, NJ, New York City and Chicago.  The markets with the lowest Sharpe ratio were Los Angeles, San Jose and San Diego.]
 
 
 
 
Slide 57
:
 
 
 
[Management discussed that it has studied the average economic return and volatility of each of its markets and notes that the markets with greater volatility tend to have greater average economic returns.  The markets with the highest volatility and average return were San Jose and San Francisco and the markets with the lowest volatility and average return were in New Jersey, Minneapolis and Southern California.]
 
Slide 58

[Total capital adjustment indicates the relative weighting of future capital allocation targets needed to achieve the desired weighting of AvalonBay's interests in a given market.]
