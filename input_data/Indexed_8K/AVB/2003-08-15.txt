On August 12, 2003, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company") announced a public offering (the "Offering") of 2,750,000 shares of its common stock.  The offering was priced to the public at $46.00 per share and the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $124,800,000 are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of debt and/or the financing of future developments and redevelopments.  The offering is being underwritten by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated.  A copy of the Company's underwriting agreement with Morgan Stanley is filed as an exhibit to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Company has granted Morgan Stanley the right to purchase up to an additional 412,500 shares to cover over-allotments.
 
                In the prospectus supplement relating to the Offering the Company described the effect on the Company's financial presentations of the Securities and Exchange Commission's July 31, 2003 clarification of certain issues surrounding EITF Topic D-42, "The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Conversion of Preferred Stock."  The change in accounting principle required under the SEC's clarification will be reflected retroactively in the Company's audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2003 which will be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC in March 2004.  This change in accounting will not impact net income, but will result in a decrease in net income available to common stockholders by $281,000, $61,000 and $7,538,000, for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively; no other periods will be impacted.

Incorporated and its counsel, so as to permit their beneficial ownership of the shares of Common Stock such entities beneficially owned immediately prior to the commencement of this offering plus such number of Shares as Morgan Stanley acquired as an underwriter in this offering and which were not subsequently resold, , that the Company's obligation to grant such a waiver shall be conditioned upon Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and any such Related Entity making such representations and undertakings as are reasonably requested by the Company; and , that no waiver shall be granted if such waiver would cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT; and , that the Company may provide that any such waiver shall expire by its terms 120 days after the date hereof.

Incorporated (sometimes hereinafter refrerred to as "Morgan Stanley") is or was not an "underwriter," as defined for purposes of Article IX of the Charter, at any time when Morgan Stanley is or was an "underwriter" of the Company's shares, as defined in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, in connection with this offering.
 
                    (i)    The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Morgan Stanley signed copies of the lock-up agreement attached as from each of its executive officers (as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act) and directors as soon as possible.

Exhibit A
 
                     7.    (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""), and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any
Indemnity and Contribution.
Exchange Act
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
 
                   (b)    Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
 
                   (c)    In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
                   (d)    To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 7(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 7(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute
pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
 
                   (e)    The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
                    (f)    The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
                     8.    . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if  after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of
Termination
hostilities, or any change in financial markets , currency exchange rates or controls or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
 
                     9.    . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
 
If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Shares that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate number of Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of the Shares to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the number of Firm Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule I bears to the aggregate number of Firm Shares set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Shares which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the number of Shares that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 9 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such number of Shares without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Shares and the aggregate number of Firm Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Firm Shares to be purchased, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any
provided
defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.

To induce the Underwriters that may participate in the Public Offering to continue their efforts in connection with the Public Offering, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley on behalf of the Underwriters, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 60 days after the date of the final prospectus relating to the Public Offering (the ""), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (a) the exercise for cash of any stock option provided that all shares issued upon exercise are subject to this agreement, (b) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the Public Offering or (c) a foreclosure by a bona fide lender upon shares which on the date of this agreement are pledged to secure a loan, provided that the undersigned used (and the undersigned hereby

The undersigned further understands that this Lock-Up Agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns.
Whether or not the Public Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including market conditions.

If the sale of the Shares to the Underwriters by the Company pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement is not completed by August 25, 2003, this Agreement and the restrictions contained herein shall terminate.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel for AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333- 103755) (the "Registration Statement"), and a prospectus supplement dated August 12, 2003 (the "Prospectus Supplement"), which supplements the prospectus included in the Registration Statement, relating to the offering of 2,750,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), and an additional 412,500 shares of Common Stock to cover over-allotments (collectively, the "Shares") by the Company to the Underwriters (as defined below) pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") dated August 12, 2003 by and between the Company and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as the representative of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters").  The prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement filed with the Commission on August 14, 2003 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the 1933 Act, is herein called the "Prospectus".
We have examined the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended and on file with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, the Underwriting Agreement, certified resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and the Investment and Finance Committee of the Board (the "IFC Committee") authorizing the issuance of the Shares (the "Authorizing Resolutions"), a certificate from the Secretary of the Company relating to the authorized powers of the IFC Committee, such records of corporate proceedings of the Company and legal considerations as we have deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement and the exhibits thereto.  In such examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity with the original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, and the accuracy of all factual statements set forth in such documents.
We express no opinion concerning the laws of any jurisdictions other than the laws of the United States of America and the Maryland General Corporation Law.
Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Shares to be sold by the Company to the Underwriters, as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement, upon the issuance of such Shares in accordance with the Authorizing Resolutions and upon delivery of such Shares and payment therefore in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
We hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 14, 2003 which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement.
