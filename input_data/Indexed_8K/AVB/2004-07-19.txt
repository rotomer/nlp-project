Item 12. Quarterly Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On July 19, 2004, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2004. That release referred to certain attachments with supplemental information that were available on the Company's website. The full text of the press release, including the supplemental information and attachments referred to within the release, are furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 hereto and are incorporated by reference herein.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be filed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
reported today that fewer dispositions in the second quarter 2004 resulted in lower Earnings per Share  diluted ("EPS") than in the same quarter of 2003, but the Company's Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders  diluted ("FFO") per share was flat as compared to second quarter 2003.
ALEXANDRIA, VA (July 19, 2004)  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE/PCX: AVB)
Net Income Available to Common Stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $32,859,000, resulting in EPS of $0.46, compared to $1.08 for the comparable period of 2003, a per share decrease of 57.4%.
FFO per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $60,450,000, or $0.83 per share compared to $57,153,000, or $0.83 per share for the comparable period of 2003. The Company's second quarter 2004 FFO per share is higher than the estimate of $0.77 to $0.81 provided in April 2004 due to better than expected community operating results, lower than expected interest expense and lower than expected property taxes due to a property tax refund pertaining to prior periods.
Commenting on the Company's results, Bryce Blair, Chairman, CEO and President said, "It is becoming increasingly apparent that our markets are transitioning to growth. Although seasonal factors will temper the third quarter, our expectation for the second half of the year is driving us to increase the mid-point of our full year financial outlook by $0.06."
Highlights from the Company's second quarter that suggest the economic expansion is leading to improved apartment fundamentals include:
Year-to-Date 2004 Financial Results
For the six months ended June 30, 2004, EPS was $0.79 compared to $1.57 for the comparable period of 2003, a per share decrease of 49.7%. FFO per share for the six months ended June 30, 2004 decreased by 2.4% to $1.62 from $1.66 for the comparable period in 2003.
Operating Results for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2004
Total revenue for the second quarter 2004 increased by $5,396,000, or 3.4% to $163,734,000 from the second quarter 2003. Total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased by $4,636,000, or 1.5% to $323,198,000 as compared to the comparable period of 2003.
, rental revenue decreased 0.8%, operating expenses increased 0.2%, and Net Operating Income ("NOI") decreased 1.2% during the second quarter 2004 as compared to the second quarter 2003. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, Established Communities rental revenue decreased 1.5%, operating expenses increased 1.6%, and NOI decreased 2.8% as compared to the comparable period of 2003.
For Established Communities
Sequentially, as compared to the first quarter 2004, Established Communities rental revenue increased 1.2%, operating expenses decreased 1.6% and NOI increased 2.5%.
 
Outlook
The Company has lowered its range for projected EPS for 2004 due to changes in its disposition plan. The Company expects EPS in the range of $0.39 to $0.43 for the third quarter of 2004 and in the range of $1.47 to $1.57 for the full year 2004.
Although market fundamentals are improving in many of the Company's markets, concessions remain prevalent and rental rates are flat sequentially. The third quarter has historically been a period of high turnover, resulting in increased operating expenses, increased availability and continued pressure on rental rates. Accordingly, the Company expects Projected FFO per share in the third quarter of 2004 to be essentially flat as compared to the second quarter of 2004, and to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the third quarter of 2004.
As such, the Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 for the third quarter of 2004 and in the range of $3.23 to $3.33 for the full year 2004.

Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the Company's use of words such as "expects," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "believes" and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including possible changes in demand for apartment homes, the effects of economic conditions (including interest rates), the impact of competition and competitive pricing, delays in completing developments and lease-ups on schedule, changes in construction costs, the results of financing efforts, the timing and closing of planned dispositions under agreement, the effects of the Company's accounting policies and other matters detailed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements."
The Company does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its expected
 
operating results for the third quarter or the full year 2004. The Company may, in its discretion, provide information in future public announcements regarding its outlook that may be of interest to the investment community. The format and extent of future outlooks may be different from the format and extent of the information contained in this release.
 
Attachment 1
This release, including its attachments, contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms. The definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. The non-GAAP financial measures referred to below should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure of liquidity or as indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of property, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a consistent basis as historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income of projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the third quarter and full year 2004 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
 
Attachment 1 (continued)
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year. Therefore, for 2004, Established Communities are communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2003 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.
Stabilized Operations
is defined by the Company as total revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, interest income and expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest and venture partner interest in profit-sharing, depreciation expense, gain on sale of communities, impairment losses, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Attachment 1 (continued)
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold or held for sale as of June 30, 2004). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or held for sale to net income for these communities for the second quarter and year-to-date 2004 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy
as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Company's communities based on their experience in renting their communities' apartments and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

Exhibit 99.2
For Immediate News Release July 19, 2004
reported today that Net Income Available to Common Stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $32,859,000, resulting in Earnings per Share  diluted ("EPS") of $0.46, compared to $1.08 for the comparable period of 2003, a per share decrease of 57.4%. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, EPS was $0.79 compared to $1.57 for the comparable period of 2003, a per share decrease of 49.7%. These decreases are primarily attributable to lower gains on sale of communities recognized in 2004 as compared to 2003, due to reduced disposition activity. The Company's reported EPS for the quarter is lower than the estimate of $0.53 to $0.57 provided in April 2004 due to changes in the timing of planned dispositions.

Established Communities Operating Statistics
Despite improving occupancy, Established Community rental revenue for the second quarter of 2004 declined on a year-over-year basis due to lower rental rates resulting from continued high concessions. However, rental revenue from Established Communities has increased sequentially for five consecutive months, largely due to increases in occupancy, resulting in a sequential quarter increase in the second quarter of 2004.
, as determined by the Company, averaged approximately $1,450 per home for the Established Community portfolio as a whole in the second quarter of 2004, remaining flat compared to average Market Rents for both the second quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004.
Market Rents

For the second quarter of 2004, rental revenue with concessions on a cash basis and rental revenue on a GAAP basis both decreased 0.8% as compared to the second quarter of 2003. Consistent with seasonal trends, cash concessions increased on an absolute basis in the second quarter of 2004 as compared to the first quarter. As a result, rental revenue with concessions on a cash basis increased 0.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2004 (versus an increase of 1.2% on a GAAP basis).
Cash concessions
Concessions granted per move-in for Established Communities averaged $1,101 during the second quarter of 2004, an increase of 39.7% from $788 in the second quarter of 2003 and an increase of 7.9% from $1,020 in the first quarter of 2004.
Acquisition and Disposition Activity
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company acquired one community, Avalon at Redondo Beach, located in Los Angeles, CA. This garden-style community contains 105 apartment homes, and was acquired for an acquisition price of $24,565,000. In addition, on July 9, 2004 the Company acquired Briarcliffe Lakeside Apartments, located in Chicago, IL. This garden-style community contains 204 apartment homes and was acquired for an acquisition price of $14,700,000, which includes the assumption of $8,155,000 of fixed rate mortgage debt.
Also during the second quarter of 2004, the Company sold two communities, Avalon Greenbriar, located in Seattle, WA, and Avalon at Laguna Niguel, located in Orange County, CA. These two communities, which contained a total of 597 apartment homes, were sold for an aggregate sales price of $61,100,000, including the transfer of $29,155,000 of variable rate, tax-exempt debt. The sale of these communities resulted in a gain as reported in accordance with GAAP of $12,375,000 and an Economic Gain of $1,685,000. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate related to these communities was 5.9%.
Development Activity
During the second quarter of 2004, the Company commenced construction of three communities. Avalon at Juanita Village, located in Seattle, WA, is expected to contain 211 apartment homes when completed for a Total Capital Cost of $45,500,000. Avalon del Rey and Avalon Camarillo, both located in the Los Angeles, CA area, are expected to contain an aggregate of 558 apartment homes when completed for
 
an aggregate Total Capital Cost of $112,700,000. Avalon at Juanita Village will be owned and operated through a joint venture partnership that will be formed upon construction completion. The Company will contribute Avalon at Juanita Village to the joint venture, at which time the Company will be reimbursed for the Total Capital Cost, while retaining a promoted residual interest in the profits of the partnership. Avalon del Rey will also be owned and operated through a joint venture partnership that will be formed upon construction completion. The Company will contribute Avalon del Rey to the joint venture, while retaining a 30% equity interest in the joint venture.
Financing, Liquidity and Balance Sheet Statistics
The Company refinanced its $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility in May 2004 concurrent with the credit facility's original maturity date. The terms of the credit facility are substantially the same as the Company's previous credit facility. Pricing under the facility is currently LIBOR plus 0.55% per year, a reduction of 0.05% from pricing for the previous facility, with a competitive bid option available that may provide for lower pricing if market conditions allow. The new credit facility has a term of three years, plus a one-year extension at the Company's option. As of June 30, 2004, the Company had $128,900,000 outstanding under this facility.
Leverage, as measured by debt as a percentage of total market capitalization, was 36.8% at June 30, 2004. Unencumbered NOI was approximately 81% for 2004 and Interest Coverage for the second quarter of 2004 was 2.7 times.
Outlook
The Company has lowered its range for projected EPS for 2004 due to changes in its disposition plan. The Company expects EPS in the range of $0.39 to $0.43 for the third quarter of 2004 and $1.47 to $1.57 for the full year 2004.
Although market fundamentals are improving in many of the Company's markets, concessions remain prevalent and rental rates are flat sequentially. The third quarter has historically been a period of high turnover, resulting in increased operating expenses, increased availability and continued pressure on rental rates. Accordingly, the Company expects Projected FFO per share in the third quarter of 2004 to be essentially flat as compared to the second quarter of 2004, and increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the third quarter of 2004.
As such, the Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84 for the third quarter of 2004. Based on second quarter 2004 operating results and expectations for continued improvement in apartment fundamentals, the Company is increasing the mid-point of its Projected FFO range provided in
April 2004 by $0.06 to a revised Projected FFO range of $3.23 to $3.33 for the full year 2004.

are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year. Therefore, for 2004, Established Communities are communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2003 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
is defined by the Company as total revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, interest income and expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest and venture partner interest in profit-sharing, depreciation expense, gain on sale of communities, impairment losses, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold or held for sale as of June 30, 2004). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or held for sale to net income for these communities for the second quarter and year-to-date 2004 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
, as used within this release for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release, of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development and Redevelopment Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first year of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents management's estimate of projected gross potential (based on leased rents for occupied homes and Market Rents, as defined below, for vacant homes) minus projected economic vacancy and adjusted for concessions. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's percentage ownership of the Total Capital Cost of each community.
Projected NOI
In this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Management believes that Projected NOI of the development and redevelopment communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development and Redevelopment Communities (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense) when they are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy. Given the different dates and fiscal years at which stabilization is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development or redevelopment is complex, impractical to develop, and of uncertain meaningfulness. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI used in the calculation of weighted average Projected NOI to Total Capital Cost.
as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Company's communities based on their experience in renting their communities' apartments and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
Market Rents
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP in helping investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions, which is an indicator of current rental market conditions. A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis)
is calculated by the Company as the gain on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP is presented on Attachment 12.
Economic Gain
is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months following the date of the buyer's valuation, less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $225  $300 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. For this purpose, management's projection of stabilized operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of approximately 2.5%  3.5%. The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for the property. Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses, including capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.
Initial Year Market Cap Rate
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, or Development Right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total capital cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.
Total Capital Cost
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
is calculated by the Company as total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization. Total market capitalization represents the aggregate of the market value of the Company's common stock, the market value of the Company's operating partnership units outstanding (based on the market value of the Company's common stock), the liquidation preference of the Company's preferred stock and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's debt. Management believes that Leverage can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company's long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company's total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company's common stock trades. Changes in Leverage also can influence changes in per share results. A calculation of Leverage as of June 30, 2004 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Leverage
Because Leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company's stock price, which occurs regularly, the Company's Leverage may change even when the Company's earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. Investors should also note that the net value of the Company's assets in liquidation is not easily determinable and may differ substantially from the Company's total market capitalization.
as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by outstanding secured debt as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, Unencumbered NOI is a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the six months ended June 30, 2004 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations divided by the sum of interest expense and preferred dividends net of interest income. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our liquidity to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Under this definition, which complies with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, EBITDA includes gains on sale of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests.
Interest Coverage
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the second quarter of 2004 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
In the calculations of EBITDA above, EBITDA from discontinued operations includes $12,375 in gain on sale of communities.
represents capital expenditures that will not directly result in revenue earnings or expense savings.
Non-Revenue Generating Capex
is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
Stabilized/Restabilized Operations
, as calculated for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities in lease-up, reflects (i) actual average leased rents for those apartments leased through the end of the quarter net of estimated stabilized concessions, (ii) estimated market rents net of comparable concessions for all unleased apartments and (iii) includes actual and estimated other rental revenue. For Development and Redevelopment Communities not yet in lease-up, Average Rent per Home reflects management's projected rents, including concessions equal to one-half month rent.
Average Rent per Home
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company's general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses. Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of the community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities.
