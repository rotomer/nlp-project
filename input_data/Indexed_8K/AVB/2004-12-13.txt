SECTION 3.          
SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER THE PLAN; MERGERS; SUBSTITUTION
 
(a)             The maximum number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan, at any given time, shall be the difference between (I) the sum of (a) 6,576,859 shares of Stock (i.e., the number as of March 1, 2001), plus (b) upon the passing of each December 31 starting with December 31, 2001, a percentage of the total number of shares of Stock (the "Year End Outstanding Shares") actually outstanding on such date (assuming all
Shares Issuable.
units of limited partnership interest in subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs that may, upon presentation for redemption, be exchanged for shares of Stock are so exchanged), less (II) any shares of Stock issued under the Plan prior to such time which have not been added back as described below in this Section 3(a).  The percentage referred to in the prior sentence shall be determined in accordance with the following table:
 
 
For purposes of determining the percentage of all awards made under the Plan during a calendar year that were in the form of Options, only Options that have an exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value on the date of grant shall count as Options.  For purposes hereof, subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs shall include, but not be limited to, Bay Countrybrook, L.P., Bay Pacific Northwest L.P., Avalon DownREIT V, L.P. and Avalon Ballston II, L.P.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of shares of Stock for which Incentive Stock Options may be issued under the Plan shall not exceed 2,500,000.  Further notwithstanding the foregoing, at least 50% of all Awards granted under the Plan during any calendar year shall be in the form of Options with an exercise price not less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant.  For purposes of determining the number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance from time to time, the shares of Stock underlying any Awards which are forfeited, canceled, reacquired by the Company, satisfied without the issuance of Stock or otherwise
terminated (other than by exercise) shall be added back to the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan.
Stock Options with respect to no more than 300,000 shares of Stock may be granted to any one individual participant during any one calendar year period.  Shares issued under the Plan may be authorized but unissued shares or shares reacquired by the Company.
                     To illustrate how the formula in the above table would work, assume that during calendar year 2002 the only awards made by the Company under the Stock Incentive Plan were an aggregate of 400,000 stock options and shares of restricted stock.  Of these, 320,000 (or 80%) were options and 80,000 (or 20%) were restricted shares.  As of December 31, 2002, assume that the Company had outstanding 67,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 1,000,000 units of limited partnership in DownREITs that may be exchanged for shares of Common Stock.  Therefore, following the table above, this means that on December 31, 2002, the Company would increase the number of available shares under the Stock Incentive Plan by multiplying 68,000,000 by 0.94%, (i.e., 639,200 shares of Common Stock would be added to the number of available shares reserved under the Stock Incentive Plan).
Example:
(b)             If, through or as a result of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction, the outstanding shares of Stock are increased or decreased or are exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company, or additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such shares of Stock or other securities, the Committee shall make an appropriate or proportionate adjustment in (i) the maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the number of Stock Options or shares of Stock that can be granted to any one individual participant, (iii) the number and kind of shares or other securities subject to any then outstanding Awards under the Plan, and (iv) the price for each share subject to any then outstanding Stock Options under the Plan, without changing the aggregate exercise price (i.e., the exercise price multiplied by the number of Stock Options) as to which such Stock Options remain exercisable.  The adjustment by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.  No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued under the Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but the Committee in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares.
Recapitalizations.
(c)             Upon consummation of a consolidation or merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in which outstanding shares of Stock are exchanged for securities, cash or other property of an unrelated corporation or business entity or in the event of a liquidation of the Company (in each case, a "Transaction"), the Board may, in its discretion, take any one or more of the following actions, as to outstanding Stock Options:  (i) provide that such Stock Options shall be assumed, or equivalent options shall be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof), (ii) upon written notice to the optionees, provide that all unexercised Stock Options will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of the Transaction unless exercised by the optionee within a specified period following the date of such notice, and/or (iii) in the event of a business combination under the terms of which holders of the Stock of the Company will receive upon consummation thereof a
Mergers.
cash payment for each share surrendered in the business combination, make or provide for a cash payment to the optionees equal to the difference between (A) the value (as determined by the Committee) of the consideration payable per share of Stock pursuant to the business combination (the "Merger Price") times the number of shares of Stock subject to such outstanding Stock Options (to the extent then exercisable at prices not in excess of the Merger Price) and (B) the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding Stock Options in exchange for the termination of such Stock Options.  In the event Stock Options will terminate upon the consummation of the Transaction, each optionee shall be permitted, within a specified period determined by the Committee, to exercise all non-vested Stock Options, subject to the consummation of the Transaction.
(d)             The Committee may grant Awards under the Plan in substitution for stock and stock based awards held by employees of another corporation who concurrently become employees of the Company or a Subsidiary as the result of a merger or consolidation of the employing corporation with the Company or a Subsidiary or the acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of property or stock of the employing corporation.  The Committee may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Committee considers appropriate in the circumstances.  Any substitute awards granted under this Plan shall not count against the share limitation set forth in Section 3(a).
Substitute Awards.
 
SECTION 4.          
ELIGIBILITY
 
Participants in the Plan will be such full or part-time officers, other employees,  Non-Employee Directors and key persons of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth or profitability of the Company and its Subsidiaries and who are selected from time to time by the Committee, in its sole discretion.  Key persons, for purposes of this Plan, shall include consultants and prospective employees.
 
SECTION 5.          
STOCK OPTIONS
 
Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Committee may from time to time approve.
Stock Options granted under the Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options.  Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Company or any Subsidiary that is a "subsidiary corporation" within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code.  To the extent that any option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
No Awards shall be granted under the Plan after May 8, 2011.
(a)             The Committee in its discretion may grant Stock Options to employees and key persons of the Company or any Subsidiary.  Stock Options granted to employees and key persons pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable.  If the Committee so determines, Stock Options may be granted in lieu of cash compensation at the
Stock Options Granted to Employees and Key Persons.
participant's election, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may establish, as well as in addition to other compensation.
(i)              The exercise price per share for the Stock covered by a Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant but shall be not less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of grant (other than options granted in lieu of cash compensation).  If an employee owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules applicable under Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or parent corporation and an Incentive Stock Option is granted to such employee, the option price shall be not less than 110% of Fair Market Value on the grant date.
Exercise Price.
(ii)             The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date the option is granted.  If an employee owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary or parent corporation and an Incentive Stock Option is granted to such employee, the term of such option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.
Option Term.
(iii)            Stock Options shall become vested and exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall be determined by the Committee at or after the grant date.  The Committee may at any time accelerate the exercisability of all or any portion of any Stock Option.  An optionee shall have the rights of a shareholder only as to shares acquired upon the exercise of a Stock Option and not as to unexercised Stock Options.
Exercisability; Rights of a Shareholder.
(iv)            Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of shares to be purchased.  Payment of the purchase price may be made by one or more of the following methods:
Method of Exercise.
(A)          In cash, by certified bank check or other instrument acceptable to the Committee;
(B)           Through the delivery (or attestation to the ownership) of shares of Stock that have been purchased by the optionee on the open market or that have been beneficially owned by the optionee for at least six months and are not then subject to restrictions under any Company plan.  Such surrendered shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date; or
(C)           By the optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company to pay the purchase price; provided that in the event the optionee chooses to pay the purchase price as so provided, the optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Committee shall prescribe as a
condition of such payment procedure.  Payment instruments will be received subject to collection.
The delivery of certificates representing shares of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option will be contingent upon receipt from the optionee (or a purchaser acting in his stead in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option) by the Company of the full purchase price for such shares and the fulfillment of any other requirements contained in the Stock Option or applicable provisions of laws.  In the event an optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the shares of Stock transferred to the optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net of the number of shares attested to.
(v)             If any optionee's employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates by reason of death, the Stock Option may thereafter be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the date of death, by the legal representative or legatee of the optionee, for a period of six months (or such longer period as the Committee shall specify at any time in the option, employment or other agreement) from the date of death, or until the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
Termination by Reason of Death.
(vi)         
Termination by Reason of Disability.
(A)          Any Stock Option held by an optionee whose employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries has terminated by reason of Disability may thereafter be exercised, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of such termination, for a period of twelve months (or such longer period as the Committee shall specify at any time in the option, employment or other agreement) from the date of such termination of employment (or other business relationship), or until the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
(B)           Except as otherwise provided by the Committee at the time of grant, the death of an optionee during a period provided in this Section 5(a)(vi) for the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option shall extend such period for six months from the date of death, subject to termination on the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
(vii)        
Termination by Reason of Retirement.
(A)          Any Stock Option held by an optionee whose employment by (and other business relationships with) the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated by reason of Retirement may thereafter be exercised, to the extent it was exercisable at the time of such termination (after giving effect to clause (C) immediately below), for a period of twelve months (or such other period as the Committee shall specify at any time in the option, employment or other agreement) from the date of such termination, or until the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
(B)           Except as otherwise provided by the Committee at any time, the death of an optionee during a period provided in this Section 5(a)(vii) for the exercise of
a Stock Option shall extend such period for six months from the date of death, subject to termination on the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
(C)           Any Stock Option held by an optionee whose employment by (and other business relationships with) the Company and its Subsidiaries is terminated by reason of Retirement shall be automatically vested as of the date of such termination notwithstanding that the provisions of the related stock option agreement may not provide for such automatic vesting.
(viii)          If any optionee's employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries has been terminated for Cause, any Stock Option held by such optionee shall immediately terminate and be of no further force and effect; provided, however, that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that such stock option can be exercised for a period of up to 30 days from the date of termination of employment (or other business relationship) or until the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
Termination for Cause.
(ix)             Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if an optionee's employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement or for Cause, any Stock Option held by such optionee may thereafter be exercised, to the extent it was exercisable on the date of termination of employment (or other business relationship), for three months (or such longer period as the Committee shall specify at any time in the option, employment or other agreement) from the date of termination of employment (or other business relationship) or until the expiration of the stated term of the Option, if earlier.
Other Termination.
(x)              To the extent required for "incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries become exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000.
Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options.
(xi)             Shares of Stock issued upon exercise of a Stock Option shall be free of all restrictions under the Plan, except as otherwise provided in this Plan.
Form of Settlement.
(b)             At the discretion of the Committee, Options granted under the Plan may include a so-called "reload" feature pursuant to which an optionee exercising an option by the delivery of a number of shares of Stock in accordance with Section 5(a)(iv)(B) hereof would automatically be granted an additional Option (with an exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the additional Option is granted and with the same expiration date as the original Option being exercised, and with such other terms as the Committee may provide) to purchase that number of shares of Stock equal to the number delivered to exercise the original Option.
Reload Options.
(c)             No Stock Option shall be transferable by the optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and all Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee, or by the optionee's legal representative or guardian in the event of the optionee's incapacity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit the optionee to transfer his Non-Qualified Stock Options to members of his immediate family, or to trusts for the benefit of such family members, or to partnerships in which such family members are the only partners, provided that the transferee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan, the applicable option agreement and all insider trading rules of the Company.
Non-transferability of Options.
 
SECTION 6.          
RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
 
(a)             The Committee may grant Restricted Stock Awards to any participant.  A Restricted Stock Award is an Award entitling the recipient to acquire, at no cost or for a purchase price determined by the Committee, shares of Stock subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee may determine at the time of grant ("Restricted Stock").  Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other business relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives.  In addition, a Restricted Stock Award may be granted to an employee by the Committee in lieu of a cash bonus due to such employee pursuant to any other plan of the Company.  In the event of termination of employment and/or other business relationships by reason of Retirement, then in such event any Restricted Stock Awards held by the terminated Award holder on the date of termination shall be automatically vested as of the date of termination notwithstanding that the provisions of the related Restricted Stock Award may not provide for such automatic vesting.
Nature of Restricted Stock Award.
(b)          
Automatic Grant of Restricted Stock to Independent Directors.
(i)            Each Non-Employee Director who is serving as a Director of the Company on the fifth business day after the 2003 annual meeting of stockholders shall automatically be granted on such day 2,500 shares of Restricted Stock, and, thereafter each Non-Employee Director who is serving as a Director of the Company on the fifth business day after each annual meeting of stockholders, beginning with the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders, shall automatically be granted on such day a number of shares of Restricted Stock equal to $100,000 based upon the closing price of shares of the Company's Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the Grant Date of the preceding year (such number to be rounded to the nearest whole number).  By way of example it is noted that the 2003 Grant Date was May 21, 2003 and that the closing stock price on such date was $43.14, which means that on the 2004 Grant Date each Non-Employee Director will be granted 2,318 shares of Restricted Stock (i.e, $100,000/$43.14).  Except as otherwise provided in the award agreement, such shares of Restricted Stock shall vest twenty percent (20%) on the date of issuance and twenty percent (20%) on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of issuance.
(ii)           Each Non-Employee Director may, pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(b), elect to receive Deferred Stock instead of Restricted Stock provided in this Section 6(b).
Any Deferred Stock granted in lieu of Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same vesting requirements applicable to the Restricted Stock.
(c)             To the extent applicable, a participant who is granted a Restricted Stock Award shall have no rights with respect to such Award unless the participant shall have accepted the Award within 60 days (or such shorter time period as the Committee may specify) following the award date by making payment to the Company, if required, in cash, by certified or bank check or other instrument or form of payment acceptable to the Committee in an amount equal to the specified purchase price, if any, of the shares covered by the Award and by executing and delivering to the Company a written instrument that sets forth the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock in such form as the Committee shall determine.
Acceptance of Award.
(d)             Upon complying with Section 6(c) above, a participant shall have all the rights of a shareholder with respect to the Restricted Stock including voting and dividend rights, subject to non-transferability restrictions and Company repurchase or forfeiture rights described in this Section 6 and subject to such other conditions contained in the written instrument evidencing the Restricted Stock Award.  Unless the Committee shall otherwise determine, certificates evidencing shares of Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company until such shares are vested as provided in Section 6(f) below.
Rights as a Shareholder.
(e)             Except as provided in an individual agreement or as otherwise determined by the Committee, shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of.  Except as provided in an individual agreement or as otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of termination of employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason (including death, retirement, Disability, and for Cause), the Company shall have the right, at the discretion of the Committee, to repurchase shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which conditions have not lapsed at their purchase price, or to require forfeiture of such shares to the Company if acquired at no cost, from the participant or the participant's legal representative.  The Company must exercise such right of repurchase or forfeiture not later than the 90th day following such termination of employment (or other business relationship), unless otherwise specified in the written instrument evidencing the Restricted Stock Award.
Restrictions.
(f)              The Committee at the time of grant shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions on which the non-transferability of the Restricted Stock and the Company's right of repurchase or forfeiture shall lapse.  Except as provided in Section 16, the vesting period for Restricted Stock shall be at least three years, except that in the case of Restricted Stock that becomes transferable and no longer subject to forfeiture upon the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions, the vesting period shall be at least one year.  Subsequent to such date or dates and/or the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no longer be Restricted Stock and shall be deemed "vested."
Vesting of Restricted Stock.
(g)             The written instrument evidencing the Restricted Stock Award may require or permit the immediate payment, waiver, deferral or investment of dividends paid on the Restricted Stock.
Waiver, Deferral and Reinvestment of Dividends.
SECTION 7.          
DEFERRED STOCK AWARDS
 
(a)             A Deferred Stock Award is an Award of phantom stock units to a participant, subject to restrictions and conditions as the Committee may determine at the time of grant.  Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other business relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives.  The grant of a Deferred Stock Award is contingent on the participant executing the Deferred Stock Award agreement.  The terms and conditions of each such agreement shall be determined by the Committee, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and participants.  At the end of the deferral period, the Deferred Stock Award, to the extent vested, shall be paid to the participant in the form of shares of Stock.  In the event of termination of employment or other business relationships by reason of Retirement, then in such event any Deferred Stock Awards held by the terminated Award holder on the date of termination shall be automatically vested as of the date of termination notwithstanding that the provisions of the related Deferred Stock Award agreement may not provide for such automatic vesting.
Nature of Deferred Stock Awards.
(b)             The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a participant, including a Non-Employee Director, to elect to receive a portion of the cash compensation or Restricted Stock Award otherwise due to such participant in the form of a Deferred Stock Award.  Any such election shall be made in writing and shall be delivered to the Company no later than the date specified by the Committee and in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee.  The Committee shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what circumstances to permit such elections and to impose such limitations and other terms and conditions thereon as the Committee deems appropriate.
Election to Receive Deferred Stock Awards in Lieu of Compensation.
(c)             During the deferral period, a participant shall have no rights as a stockholder; provided, however, that the participant may be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the phantom stock units underlying his Deferred Stock Award, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.
Rights as a Stockholder.
(d)             A Deferred Stock Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the deferral period.
Restrictions.
(e)             Except as may otherwise be provided by the Committee either in the Award, employment or other agreement or, subject to Section 14 below, in writing after the Award agreement is issued, a participant's right in all Deferred Stock Awards that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the participant's termination of employment (or cessation of business relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.
Termination.
 
SECTION 8.          
UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at a purchase price determined by the Committee) an Unrestricted Stock Award to any participant which will entitle such participant to receive shares of Stock free of any restrictions under the Plan ("Unrestricted Stock").  Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted or sold as described in the preceding
sentence in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of any cash compensation due to such participant.
 
SECTION 9.          
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS
 
(a)             A Performance Share Award is an award entitling the recipient to acquire shares of Stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals.  The Committee may make Performance Share Awards independent of or in connection with the granting of any other Award under the Plan.  Performance Share Awards may be granted under the Plan to any participants, including those who qualify for awards under other performance plans of the Company.  The Committee in its sole discretion shall determine whether and to whom Performance Share Awards shall be made, the performance goals applicable under each such Award, the periods during which performance is to be measured, and all other limitations and conditions applicable to the awarded Performance Shares; provided, however, that the Committee may rely on the performance goals and other standards applicable to other performance unit plans of the Company in setting the standards for Performance Share Awards under the Plan.
Nature of Performance Shares.
(b)             Performance Share Awards and all rights with respect to such Awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered.
Restrictions on Transfer.
(c)             A participant receiving a Performance Share Award shall have the rights of a shareholder only as to shares actually received by the participant under the Plan and not with respect to shares subject to the Award but not actually received by the participant.  A participant shall be entitled to receive a stock certificate evidencing the acquisition of shares of Stock under a Performance Share Award only upon satisfaction of all conditions specified in the written instrument evidencing the Performance Share Award (or in a performance plan adopted by the Committee).
Rights as a Shareholder.
(d)             Except as may otherwise be provided by the Committee in the Award, employment or other agreement, a participant's rights in all Performance Share Awards shall automatically terminate upon the participant's termination of employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason (including death, Disability and for Cause).
Termination.
(e)             At any time prior to or upon the participant's termination of employment (or other business relationship) by the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Committee may in its sole discretion accelerate, waive or, subject to Section 14, amend any or all of the goals, restrictions or conditions imposed under any Performance Share Award.
Acceleration, Waiver, Etc.
 
SECTION 10.        
QUALIFIED PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS TO COVERED EMPLOYEES
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Restricted Stock Award, Deferred Stock Award or Performance Share Award granted to a Covered Employee is intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (a "Performance-based Award"), such Award shall comply with the provisions set forth below:
(a)             The performance criteria used in performance goals governing Performance-based Awards granted to Covered Employees may include any or all of the following:  (i) the Company's return on equity, assets, capital or investment, (ii) pre-tax or after-tax profit levels of the Company or any Subsidiary, a division, an operating unit or a business segment of the Company, or any combination of the foregoing; (iii) cash flow, funds from operations or similar measure; (iv) total shareholder return; (v) changes in the market price of the Stock; (vi) market share; or (vii) earnings per share.

Each Performance-based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable, upon achievement of the various applicable performance targets.  The performance criteria established by the Committee may be (but need not be) different for each Performance Cycle and different goals may be applicable to Performance-based Awards to different Covered Employees.
Grant of Qualified Performance-based Awards.
(c)             Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, the Committee shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the performance criteria for the Performance Cycle have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the Qualified Performance-based Awards earned for the Performance Cycle.  The Committee shall then determine the actual size of each Covered Employee's Qualified Performance-based Award, and, in doing so, may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Qualified Performance-based Award for a Covered Employee if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate.
Payment of Qualified Performance-based Awards.
(d)             The maximum Qualified Performance-based Award payable to any one Covered Employee under the Plan for a Performance Cycle is 200,000 shares of Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(b) hereof).

(a)             A Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive credits based on cash dividends that would have been paid on the shares of Stock specified in the Dividend Equivalent Right (or other award to which it relates) if such shares had been issued to and held by the recipient.  A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any participant as a component of another Award or as a freestanding award.  The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the grant.

Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or shares of Stock or a combination thereof, in a single installment or installments.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon exercise, settlement, or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other award.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other award.

The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the participant.  The Company's obligation to deliver stock certificates to any participant (or his agent or broker) is subject to and conditioned on tax obligations being satisfied by the participant.  To the extent a participant (or his agent or broker) accepts delivery of stock certificates, the participant shall be deemed to agree to indemnify the Company for any damages resulting from the participant's failure to satisfy any tax obligations.
Payment by Participant.
(b)             Subject to approval by the Committee, a participant may elect to have such minimum tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by (i) authorizing the Company to withhold from shares of Stock to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the minimum withholding amount due, (ii) transferring to the Company shares of Stock owned by the participant with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the minimum withholding amount due, or (iii) in a combination of (i) and (ii).

(b)           an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to re-employment (or other business relationship) is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Committee otherwise so provides in writing.
 
SECTION 14.        
AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION
 
The Board may at any time amend or discontinue the Plan and the Committee may at any time amend or cancel any outstanding Award for the purpose of satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no such action shall (a) adversely affect rights under any outstanding Award without the holder's written consent or (b) without the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, reduce the exercise price of or otherwise reprice, including through replacement grants, any outstanding Stock Option.  To the extent required by the Code to ensure that Options that have been granted hereunder as Incentive Stock Options continue to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, Plan amendments shall be subject to approval by the Company's stockholders.
 
SECTION 15.        
STATUS OF PLAN
 
With respect to the portion of any Award which has not been exercised and any payments in cash, Stock or other consideration not received by a participant, a participant shall have no rights greater than those of a general creditor of the Company unless the Committee shall otherwise expressly determine in connection with any Award or Awards.  In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations to deliver Stock or make payments with respect to Awards hereunder, provided that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the provision of the foregoing sentence.

Rights as a Shareholder

If the Optionee intends to dispose or does dispose (whether by sale, gift, transfer or otherwise) of any such Option Shares within these periods, he or she will notify the Company within thirty (30) days after such disposition.

The Optionee shall, not later than the date as of which the exercise of this Option becomes a taxable event for federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company (or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for payment of) any federal, state and local taxes required by law to be withheld on account of such taxable event.  The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the Company has the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee, or from the Option Shares to be issued in respect of an exercise of this Option, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the issuance of shares of Stock to the Optionee.
Withholding Taxes

[IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS OF MESSRS. BLAIR, NAUGHTON, SARGEANT, FULLER AND HOREY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO THE FOLLOWING ADDENDUM TO ALL INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION AGREEMENTS WITH SUCH INDIVIDUALS.]
 
FORM OF ADDENDUM TO ISO STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
FOR CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WITH EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
                      
 
 
This Addendum to Stock Option Agreement is dated as of                   .
 
Reference is made to the following agreement (the "Unmodified Stock Option Agreement"):
 
Incentive Stock Option Agreement between                  ("Employee") and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. ("AvalonBay"), dated                   , with respect to            stock options (the "Options") having an exercise price of $        .
 
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement.
 
                For the convenience of AvalonBay, the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement is in a standard format commonly used by AvalonBay.  However, this Addendum to Stock Option Agreement (the "Addendum") contains one or more provisions (the "Modifications") approved by the Board of Directors of AvalonBay (the "Board") that are inconsistent with the terms of the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement.  The Board approved the Modifications at the time it approved the grant of the Options to Employee, and for ease of administration the Company is documenting the grant of the Options with the Modifications by entering into the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement and this Addendum.
 
                NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, AvalonBay and Employee agree as follows:
 
If, pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement between the Company and Employee dated               , as amended, or pursuant to the terms of a successor agreement or arrangement (other than the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement), the vesting of Employee's stock options is accelerated upon the termination of his employment, then the following shall apply:   any Option then held by Employee may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date of termination (after giving effect to accelerated vesting), for a period of one (1) year from the date of termination, or until the Expiration Date, if earlier.
 
For clarification it is noted that the terms of the preceding paragraph will not apply if vesting of Employee's stock options is not accelerated upon a termination of employment (e.g., if he voluntarily resigns without a Constructive Termination Without Cause, as defined in the Employment Agreement).  In such cases, the period of time following termination in which the Options must be exercised will be determined by the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement, which generally provides that the Options will terminate earlier than one year from the date of termination.
 
Except as stated above, the terms of the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement apply in full to the Options.
 
 
 
                Receipt is hereby acknowledged of a copy of the Company's Plan, the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement and this Addendum.  The undersigned agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Unmodified Stock Option Agreement and this Addendum.

From and after the Award Date, the Director shall not have any of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Units until the Units are distributed to the Director in the form of Common Stock, except with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights as set forth on Section 2.3.
 
Section 2.3

                All Units granted hereunder shall carry Dividend Equivalent Rights which shall entitle the Director to receive additional Units, based on the amount of actual dividends payable by the Company with respect to the Common Stock.  The amount of dividend equivalents credited to the Director's Units following each calendar quarter shall be converted to additional Units based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the last day of such calendar quarter.

Except as provided in clauses (a) through (e) of this sentence or in the following paragraph, any interest of the Director in Units that are Unvested Units shall immediately terminate if the Director's service as a director of the Company terminates for any reason, unless such termination of service results from (a) death of the Director, (b) Disability of the Director, (c) removal of the Director from office by vote of the Company's stockholders for any reason other than for Cause, (d) failure by the Board of Directors or any authorized committee thereof to nominate the Director for re-election for any reason other than for Cause or (e) failure of the Company's stockholders to re-elect the Director.
In the event that the Director resigns or declines to accept nomination for re-election, any Units that are Unvested Units shall continue to vest on the dates provided in this Agreement as if the Director continued to serve on the Board of Directors unless the Board of Directors or any authorized committee thereof determines in good faith that there exist reasonable grounds on which the stockholders of the Company could remove the Director for Cause (in which case any interest of the Director in Units that are Unvested Units shall immediately upon such determination terminate).
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs, in the event that any Unvested Units are forfeited, the Director shall be entitled to retain any Units credited to his account pursuant to the Dividend Equivalent Rights accrued on the Unvested Units in accordance with Section 2.3 before the date of such event.
