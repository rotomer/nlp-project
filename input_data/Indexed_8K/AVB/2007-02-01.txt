Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
January 31, 2007
reported today that Net Income Available to Common Stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 was $47,101,000. This resulted in Earnings per Share  diluted ("EPS") of $0.62 for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared to $1.26 for the comparable period of 2005, a per share decrease of 50.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, EPS was $3.57 compared to $4.21 for the comparable period of 2005, a per share decrease of 15.2%. These decreases are primarily attributable to gains from increased sales volume in 2005, partially offset by growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2006.
(Alexandria, VA) AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE: AVB)
Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders  diluted ("FFO") for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 was $82,549,000, or $1.09 per share compared to $70,109,000, or $0.93 per share for the comparable period of 2005, a per share increase of 17.2%. This increase is driven primarily from improved community operating results and contributions by newly developed communities.
FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by 16.2% to $4.38 from $3.77 for the year ended December 31, 2005. FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes $0.18 per share related to the sale of three land parcels and the final installment from the sale of a technology venture. FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes several non-routine items totaling $0.11 per share. Adjusting for these non-routine items in both years, FFO per share increased 14.8%, driven primarily by contributions from improved community operating results and newly developed communities.
Commenting on the Company's results, Bryce Blair, Chairman and CEO, said, "Fourth quarter NOI growth of nearly 11% capped a year of strong financial performance for the Company, and we expect another year of strong earnings growth in 2007. This supports our announcement last evening that we raised our quarterly dividend by 9% for the first quarter."

First Quarter 2007 Dividend Declaration
The Company announced yesterday that its Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2007 of $0.85 per share on the Company's common stock (par value $0.01 per share). The declared dividend represents a 9.0%, or $0.07 per share, increase over the Company's prior quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. The common stock dividend is payable April 16, 2007 to all common stockholders of record as of April 2, 2007.
In declaring the increased dividend, the Board of Directors evaluated the Company's past performance and future prospects for earnings growth. Additional factors considered in determining the increase include current dividend distributions (both common and preferred dividends), the ratio of the current common dividend distribution to the Company's FFO, the relationship of dividend distributions to taxable income, and expected growth in taxable income. Taxable income growth is not directly comparable to growth in FFO.
The Board of Directors also declared a dividend on the Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (par value $0.01 per share) for the first quarter of 2007. The Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock dividend is $0.54375 per share and is payable June 15, 2007 to all Series H stockholders of record as of June 1, 2007.

Definitions and Reconciliations
Non-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined and further explained on Attachment 15, "Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms" of the full earnings release. Attachment 15 is included in the full earnings release available at the Company's website at . This wire distribution includes only definitions and reconciliations of the following Non-GAAP financial measures:
http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
 
     The above items were partially offset by:
 
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the first quarter and full year 2007 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management, net interest expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest expense, depreciation expense, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
, as used within this release for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer's valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development and Redevelopment Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first year of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents Management's estimate of projected gross potential (based on leased rents for occupied homes and Market Rents, as defined below, for vacant homes) minus projected economic vacancy and adjusted for concessions. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
Projected NOI
Management believes that Projected NOI of the development and redevelopment communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding Management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development and Redevelopment Communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development or redevelopment is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
 
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the fourth quarter of 2006 are as follows (dollars in thousands):

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company and its joint venture partner sold Avalon Bedford, a 368 apartment-home community located in Stamford, CT, for a sales price of $79,100,000. Avalon Bedford was owned by a joint venture in which the Company had a 25% equity interest. The Company's share of the gain as reported in accordance with GAAP is $6,609,000 and its share of the Economic Gain is $3,994,000.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed a previously arranged transaction to admit a 70% partner to the joint venture which owns Avalon Del Rey, while retaining a 30% investment interest and serving as the managing member. This joint venture entity will continue to be consolidated.
Excluding dispositions to joint venture entities where the Company retains an economic interest, the Company sold four communities during 2006 (one through a joint venture), containing a total of 1,036 apartment homes, and three land parcels. These communities and land parcels were sold for an aggregate sales price of approximately $281,485,000, resulting in a GAAP Gain of $117,539,000 and an Economic Gain of $95,840,000. Excluding the land parcels, the weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate related to these dispositions was 4.6% and the Unleveraged IRR over a weighted average hold period of eight years was 15.2%.
Investment Management Fund Activity
AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a private, discretionary investment vehicle in which the Company holds an equity interest of approximately 15%. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Fund acquired two communities:
During 2006, the Fund acquired a total of five communities, containing an aggregate of 1,182 apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of $223,670,000.
In January 2007, the Fund acquired Centerpoint for a purchase price of $78,500,000. Centerpoint consists of a newly constructed high-rise tower and separate, recently renovated historic mid-rise buildings located within a single downtown city block of Baltimore, MD. The community contains a total of 392 apartment homes and approximately 33,000 square feet of retail space.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Fund commenced the redevelopment of the following communities:
Financing, Liquidity and Balance Sheet Statistics
During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company entered into a new $650,000,000 variable rate unsecured credit facility, replacing its old facility. Pricing under the new facility is the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.4%, a reduction in pricing of 0.15% from the previous facility. The rate can be higher or lower based on the credit rating of the Company and selected maturity of the borrowings. This credit facility may be increased by the Company to $1,000,000,000 (provided that one or more banks voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment) and has a term of four years with a single one-year renewal option.
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its $650,000,000 unsecured credit facility. Leverage, calculated as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization, was 22.3% at December 31, 2006. Unencumbered NOI for the year ended December 31, 2006 exceeded 82% and Interest Coverage for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 3.9 times.
In January 2007, the Company filed a new shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing the Company to sell an undetermined number or amount of certain debt and equity securities as defined in the prospectus.
In January 2007, in conjunction with the inclusion of its common stock in the S&P 500 Index, the Company issued 4,600,000 shares of its common stock at $129.30 per share. Net proceeds in the amount of approximately $594,000,000 will be used for general corporate purposes.
 
 
 
First Quarter 2007 Dividend Declaration
The Company announced yesterday that its Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2007 of $0.85 per share on the Company's common stock (par value $0.01 per share). The declared dividend represents a 9.0%, or $0.07 per share, increase over the Company's prior quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share. The common stock dividend is payable April 16, 2007 to all common stockholders of record as of April 2, 2007.
In declaring the increased dividend, the Board of Directors evaluated the Company's past performance and future prospects for earnings growth. Additional factors considered in determining the increase include current dividend distributions (both common and preferred dividends), the ratio of the current common dividend distribution to the Company's FFO, the relationship of dividend distributions to taxable income, and expected growth in taxable income. Taxable income growth is not directly comparable to growth in FFO.
The Board of Directors also declared a dividend on the Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (par value $0.01 per share) for the first quarter of 2007. The Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock dividend is $0.54375 per share and is payable June 15, 2007 to all Series H stockholders of record as of June 1, 2007.
2007 Financial Outlook
As noted in the Company's initial 2007 financial outlook provided on January 8, 2007, the Company expects EPS in the range of $3.66 to $3.90 for the full year 2007. The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $4.68 to $4.92 for the full year 2007.

Attachment 15
This release, including its attachments, contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms. The definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. The non-GAAP financial measures referred to below should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure of liquidity or as indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
 
- Gains on the sale of two land parcels;
- Gain on the sale of a technology venture; and
- Income related to the impact of the development by a third-party of a hotel adjacent to one of the Company's existing communities.
The above items were partially offset by:
- Separation costs due to the departure of a senior executive; and
- Accrual of costs related to various litigation matters.
 
 
Attachment 15 (continued)
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the first quarter and full year 2007 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management, net interest expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest expense, depreciation expense, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
 
 
Attachment 15 (continued)
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
, as used within this release for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer's valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development and Redevelopment Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first year of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents Management's estimate of projected gross potential (based on leased rents for occupied homes and Market Rents, as defined below, for vacant homes) minus projected economic vacancy and adjusted for concessions. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative
Projected NOI
 
Attachment 15 (continued)
costs. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
Management believes that Projected NOI of the development and redevelopment communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding Management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development and Redevelopment Communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development or redevelopment is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions. A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis
is calculated by the Company as the gain on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for both the year ended December 31, 2006 as well as prior years' activities is presented on Attachment 14.
Economic Gain
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
 
Attachment 15 (continued)
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the fourth quarter of 2006 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, or Development Right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. For Redevelopment Communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.
Total Capital Cost
is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $200  $300 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. The gross sales price is adjusted for transaction costs and deferred maintenance in determining the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for acquisitions. Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents management's estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items. For this purpose, management's projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 3.0%  3.5%. The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for the property. Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community (for dispositions) and on the expected total investment in each community (for acquisitions).
Initial Year Market Cap Rate
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
 
Attachment 15 (continued)
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company's general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses. Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of the community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities. The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the holding period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.
is calculated by the Company as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization. Total Market Capitalization represents the aggregate of the market value of the Company's common stock, the market value of the Company's operating partnership units outstanding (based on the market value of the Company's common stock), the liquidation preference of the Company's preferred stock and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's debt. Management believes that Leverage can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company's long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company's total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company's common stock trades. Changes in Leverage also can influence changes in per share results. A calculation of Leverage as of December 31, 2006 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Leverage
Because Leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company's stock price, which occurs regularly, the Company's Leverage may change even when the Company's earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. Investors should also note that the net realizable value of the Company's assets in liquidation is not easily determinable and may differ substantially from the Company's Total Market Capitalization.
as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by either outstanding secured debt or land leases (excluding land leases with purchase options that were put in place for governmental incentives or tax abatements) as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the year ended December 31, 2006 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
 
Attachment 15 (continued)
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year. Therefore, for 2006, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2005 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
are calculated by the Company as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.
Average Rental Rates
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy
as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Company's communities based on their experience in renting their communities' apartments and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
Market Rents
represents capital expenditures that will not directly result in revenue earnings or expense savings.
Non-Revenue Generating Capex
is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
Stabilized/Restabilized Operations
, as calculated for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities in lease-up, reflects (i) actual average leased rents for those apartments leased through the end of the quarter net of estimated stabilized concessions, (ii) estimated market rents net of comparable concessions for all unleased apartments and (iii) includes actual and estimated other rental revenue. For Development and Redevelopment Communities not yet in lease-up, Average Rent per Home reflects management's projected rents.
Average Rent per Home
are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which the Company either has an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which the Company is the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where the Company owns land to develop a new community. The Company capitalizes related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which future development is probable.
