Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 25, 2007, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter 2007. That release referred to certain attachments with supplemental information that were available on the Company's website. The full text of the press release, including the supplemental information and attachments referred to within the release, are furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 hereto.
Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
On April 24, 2007, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company") concluded that its previously issued consolidated financial statements, and the related auditor's reports thereon, for each of the following periods should no longer be relied upon and should be restated to reflect non-cash charges related to a change in the Company's method of accounting for its obligations under land leases: the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2006 included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006; the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006; and the three months ended March 31, 2006 included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
The change in land lease accounting primarily affects the accounting for land lease payments made by the Company under one land lease. The decision to change the accounting for land leases was made in connection with the Company's preparation of its financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2007. As a result, the Company will file restated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 in a Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2006 and will reflect the restatement of the unaudited quarterly financial statements for the first three quarters of 2006 in the footnotes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K/A and in the Company's quarterly filings on Form 10-Q that will be filed in 2007.
The non-cash adjustments that will accrue as a result of the change in accounting arise from the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." SFAS 13 requires that, for operating land leases, lease payments be recognized on a straight-line basis each year during the full term of the lease (i.e., by dividing the cumulative undiscounted rental payments, including all fixed or minimum escalations, over the number of years in the lease) unless, alternatively, there is another systematic and rational basis that is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property, in which case that basis will be used. The Company (relying on SFAS 13's reference to an alternative basis to straight-lining over the full term of the lease) determined that it was appropriate to straight-line over the Company's historical and expected average holding period of communities, which approximates current payments under the lease. Based on further consideration of this issue, including a review of changes to land lease accounting by other companies in recent years, the Company has determined that a more appropriate application of SFAS 13 is to straight-line land lease obligations over the full term of the lease, without regard to the expected holding period. In the case of one of the Company's land leases with a 90-year term, this has the effect of causing the Company to accrue for land lease payments of approximately $11.2 million per year, as opposed, for example, to the 2006 actual cash land lease payment of approximately $1.0 million. In the aggregate, the change in accounting results in a reduction of net income available to common stockholders from amounts previously reported of approximately $11.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, or a reduction in the previously reported net income available to common stockholders of 4.4%, 3.8%, and 5.7%, respectively. If the assets subject to land leases were sold today, the full cumulative amount of this incremental accrued expense would be recaptured into net income in the year of sale. The restatement will not impact historical or future cash flows provided by operating activities or the timing or amount of payments under the related land leases, or compliance with any financial ratio covenant under the Company's credit facility or debt instruments.
The audit committee of our Board of Directors and management have discussed this matter with Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, which agrees with the changes we have made to our accounting for land leases.
On April 25, 2007, the Company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2007 and announcing its planned restatements related to the change in land lease accounting. The press release reflects the pending adjustments to previously issued financial statements summarized above, to the extent applicable to the periods and financial statements referred to in the Company's April 25, 2007 press release. That release referred to certain attachments with supplemental information that were available on the Company's website. The full text of the press release, including the supplemental information and attachments referred to within the release, are furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 hereto.

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate News Release
April 25, 2007
reported today that Net Income Available to Common Stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 was $44,345,000. This resulted in Earnings per Share  diluted ("EPS") of $0.56 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared to $1.45 for the comparable period of 2006, a per share decrease of 61.4%. This decrease is primarily attributable to gains from sales of land and communities in 2006, partially offset by growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2007.
(Alexandria, VA) AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE: AVB)
Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders  diluted ("FFO") for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 was $89,118,000, or $1.11 per share compared to $84,189,000, or $1.12 per share for the comparable period of 2006. FFO per share includes $0.01 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 and $0.17 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 related to the sale of land parcels. Adjusting for land sales in both periods, FFO per share increased 15.8%, due primarily to contributions from improved community operating results and newly developed communities. As explained later in this release, the Company made a change related to its accounting for land leases. This change resulted in a non-cash charge to operating expenses and reduced reported FFO by $0.04 per share from what would otherwise have been reported for the three months ended March 31, 2007. Results for the three months ended March 31, 2006 have also been restated to reflect the impact of this change.
Operating Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2007 Compared to the Prior Year Period
, including discontinued operations, total revenue increased by $19,917,000, or 11.3% to $196,706,000. , rental revenue increased 6.6%, comprised of an increase in Average Rental Rates of 7.0% and a decrease in Economic Occupancy of 0.4%. As a result, total revenue for Established Communities increased $9,883,000 to $159,665,000. Operating expenses for Established Communities increased $1,333,000, or 2.7% to $51,022,000. Accordingly, Net Operating Income ("NOI") for Established Communities increased by $8,550,000, or 8.5%, to $108,643,000.

Development and Redevelopment Activity
The Company completed the development of two communities during the first quarter of 2007. Avalon Chestnut Hill, located in Chestnut Hill (Boston), MA, is a mid-rise community containing 204 apartment homes and was completed for a Total Capital Cost of $61,200,000. Avalon at Decoverly II, the second phase of a two-phase community located in Rockville, MD, is a garden-style community containing 196 apartment homes. Avalon at Decoverly II was completed for a Total Capital Cost of $30,800,000.
The Company began construction of Avalon Morningside Park, a wholly owned community in the first quarter of 2007. Avalon Morningside Park is located in New York, NY, and will contain a total of 296 apartment homes when completed for an estimated Total Capital Cost of $125,500,000.
In the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed the redevelopment of one community, Avalon Arlington Heights located in Arlington Heights (Chicago), IL. This community contains an aggregate of 409 apartment homes and was completed for a Total Capital Cost of $6,700,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment.
During the first quarter of 2007, the Company purchased a parcel of land located in Brooklyn, NY for approximately $70,000,000. In April 2007, the Company acquired additional development rights associated with this land parcel for a purchase price of $10,500,000. The Company expects to begin construction of a 628 apartment home high-rise community in the second half of 2007.
In April 2007, a fire at Avalon Danvers, a development community located in Danvers (Boston), MA, damaged 147 of the planned 433 apartment homes. The impacted apartment homes were under construction and unoccupied. The fire did not damage the structures housing the current leasing operations or occupied apartment homes. The Company expects that insurance proceeds will substantially cover the cost to reconstruct all damaged assets as well as provide for a reimbursement of lost net operating income due to schedule delays, resulting in no material net economic loss to the Company.
Investment Management Fund Activity
AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a private, discretionary investment vehicle in which the Company holds an equity interest of approximately 15%. During the first quarter of 2007, the Fund acquired three communities:
During the first quarter of 2007, the Fund commenced the redevelopment of Fuller Martel, located in Los Angeles, CA. Fuller Martel contains 82 apartment homes and will be redeveloped for an expected Total Capital Cost of $3,400,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment.
As of March 31, 2007, the Fund has invested $609,250,000, which represents approximately 70% of the expected total investment.
Financing, Liquidity and Balance Sheet Statistics
In January 2007, the Company filed a new shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing the Company to sell an undetermined number or amount of certain debt and equity securities as defined in the prospectus.
In January 2007, in conjunction with the inclusion of its common stock in the S&P 500 Index, the Company issued 4,600,000 shares of its common stock at $129.30 per share. Net proceeds of approximately $594,000,000 will be used for general corporate purposes.

In addition the Company had $356,400,000 in unrestricted cash available at March 31, 2007. Leverage, calculated as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization, was 21.2% at March 31, 2007. Unencumbered NOI for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 was 82% and Interest Coverage for the first quarter of 2007 was 4.4 times.

Revised Accounting Interpretation
On April 24, 2007, the Company determined to revise its accounting for long-term land leases to provide for the straight-lining of lease payments with fixed, or minimum, escalations over the entire lease term as opposed to the Company's expected holding period of its interest in the asset. This change primarily impacts the land lease accounting related to one consolidated asset with a 90 year lease in which the land lessor is also the partner in the venture holding the asset. The change is expected to result in an additional non-cash increase to operating expenses of approximately $10,500,000 per year in excess of the current annual cash payments, as well as additional depreciation expense. Information provided in this release for the three months ended March 31, 2006 has been restated from our previously reported results to reflect this accounting change and provide comparable results to the three months ended March 31, 2007. While the amounts involved do not affect the economics of the joint venture or the Company's cash flows, management intends to seek an amendment of the lease terms or otherwise resolve the need to continue to accrue lease expense that is significantly in excess of our actual cash rental payments. An amendment or sale would eliminate this non-cash expense in the future. A sale of the asset related to this land lease would also trigger the recapture into net income of the cumulative amount of the prior period non-cash accruals at the date of sale. However, no assurance can be provided that an amendment will occur, that the joint venture structure can be changed or that the underlying asset would be sold in such a manner.
The Company will restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 to reflect this revised accounting treatment. This change in accounting will result in a reduction of net income of approximately $11,900,000 in each year, or 4.4%, 3.8% and 5.7% of net income available to common stockholders, respectively.
Second Quarter 2007 Financial Outlook
The Company expects EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.95 for the second quarter of 2007 and expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $1.13 to $1.17 for the second quarter of 2007. The financial outlook provided for the second quarter 2007 includes $0.03 per share related to the revised lease accounting discussed in this release.
The Company expects to release its second quarter 2007 earnings on August 1, 2007 after the market closes. The Company expects to hold a conference call on August 2, 2007 at 11:00 AM EDT to discuss the second quarter 2007 results.

Definitions and Reconciliations
Non-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined and further explained on Attachment 13, "Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms." Attachment 13 is included in the full earnings release available at the Company's website at . This wire distribution includes only definitions and reconciliations of the following Non-GAAP financial measures:
http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2007 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
 
 
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management, net interest expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest expense, depreciation expense, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
&nbsp;
 
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the first quarter of 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands):

While the amounts involved do not affect the economics of the joint venture or the Company's cash flows, management intends to seek an amendment of the lease terms or otherwise resolve the need to continue to accrue lease expense that is significantly in excess of our actual cash rental payments. An amendment or sale would eliminate this non-cash expense in the future. A sale of the asset related to this land lease would also trigger the recapture into net income of the cumulative amount of the prior period non-cash accruals at the date of sale. However, no assurance can be provided that an amendment will occur, that the joint venture structure can be changed or that the underlying asset would be sold in such a manner.
The Company will restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 to reflect this revised accounting treatment. This change in accounting will result in a reduction of net income of approximately $11,900,000 in each year, or 4.4%, 3.8% and 5.7% of net income available to common stockholders, respectively.
Second Quarter 2007 Financial Outlook
The Company expects EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.95 for the second quarter of 2007 and expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $1.13 to $1.17 for the second quarter of 2007. The financial outlook provided for the second quarter 2007 includes $0.03 per share related to the revised lease accounting discussed in this release.
The Company expects to release its second quarter 2007 earnings on August 1, 2007 after the market closes. The Company expects to hold a conference call on August 2, 2007 at 11:00 AM EDT to discuss the second quarter 2007 results.

Attachment 13
This release, including its attachments, contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms. The definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. The non-GAAP financial measures referred to below should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure of liquidity or as indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
 
     
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the second quarter of 2007 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management, net interest expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest expense, depreciation expense, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
 
     
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
, as used within this release for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer's valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development and Redevelopment Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first year of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents management's estimate of projected gross potential (based on leased rents for occupied homes and Market Rents, as defined below, for vacant homes) minus projected economic vacancy and adjusted for concessions. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
Projected NOI
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
Management believes that Projected NOI of the development and redevelopment communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding Management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development and Redevelopment Communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development or redevelopment is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions. A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis
is calculated by the Company as the gain on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for both the three months ended March 31, 2007 as well as prior years' activities is presented on Attachment 12.
Economic Gain
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the first quarter of 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, or Development Right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. For Redevelopment Communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.
Total Capital Cost
is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $200  $300 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents management's estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items. For this purpose, management's projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 3.0%  3.5%. The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property. Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.
Initial Year Market Cap Rate
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company's general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses.
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities. The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the holding period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.
is calculated by the Company as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization. Total Market Capitalization represents the aggregate of the market value of the Company's common stock, the market value of the Company's operating partnership units outstanding (based on the market value of the Company's common stock), the liquidation preference of the Company's preferred stock and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's debt. Management believes that Leverage can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company's long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company's total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company's common stock trades. Changes in Leverage also can influence changes in per share results. A calculation of Leverage as of March 31, 2007 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Leverage
Because Leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company's stock price, which occur regularly, the Company's Leverage may change even when the Company's earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. Investors should also note that the net realizable value of the Company's assets in liquidation is not easily determinable and may differ substantially from the Company's Total Market Capitalization.
as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by either outstanding secured debt or land leases (excluding land leases with purchase options that were put in place for governmental incentives or tax abatements) as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2007 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year. Therefore, for 2007, Established Communities
Established Communities
 
Attachment 13 (continued)
are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2006 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Communities
are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. For wholly-owned communities, redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community's acquisition cost. The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities that are not wholly-owned.
Redevelopment Communities
are calculated by the Company as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.
Average Rental Rates
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy
as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Company's communities based on their experience in renting their communities' apartments and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
Market Rents
represents capital expenditures that will not directly result in revenue earnings or expense savings.
Non-Revenue Generating Capex
is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
Stabilized/Restabilized Operations
, as calculated for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities in lease-up, reflects (i) actual average leased rents for those apartments leased through the end of the quarter net of estimated stabilized concessions, (ii) estimated market rents net of comparable concessions for all unleased apartments and (iii) includes actual and estimated other rental revenue. For Development and Redevelopment Communities not yet in lease-up, Average Rent per Home reflects management's projected rents.
Average Rent per Home
are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which the Company either has an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which the Company is the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where the Company owns land to develop a new community. The Company capitalizes related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which future development is probable.
