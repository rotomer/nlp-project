Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate News Release July 31, 2007
reported today that Net Income Available to Common Stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $48,877,000. This resulted in Earnings per Share  diluted ("EPS") of $0.61 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, compared to $0.86 for the comparable period of 2006, a per share decrease of 29.1%. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, EPS was $1.16 compared to $2.31 for the comparable period of 2006, a per share decrease of 49.8%. These decreases are primarily attributable to the gains from the sale of land and communities in 2006, partially offset by growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2007. Results for 2006 have been restated to reflect the non-cash charges associated with our change in the accounting for certain land leases.
(Alexandria, VA) AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE: AVB)
Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders  diluted ("FFO") for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $94,041,000, or $1.17 per share, compared to $74,855,000, or $0.99 per share for the comparable period of 2006. FFO per share increased 18.2%, due primarily to contributions from improved community operating results and newly developed communities. Results for both periods include the impact of a change in the accounting for non-cash charges for certain land leases.
FFO per share for the six months ended June 30, 2007 increased by 8.1% to $2.28 from $2.11 for the comparable period of 2006. FFO per share for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, as restated, includes $0.01 and $0.17 per share, respectively, related to the sale of land parcels. Adjusting for these land sales in both years, FFO per share increased 17.0%, driven primarily by improved community operating results and contributions from newly developed communities.
Operating Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2007 Compared to the Prior Year Period
, including discontinued operations, total revenue increased by $22,708,000, or 12.6% to $203,540,000. , rental revenue increased 6.3%, comprised of an increase in Average Rental Rates of 6.6% and a decrease in Economic Occupancy of 0.3%. As a result, total revenue for Established Communities increased $9,608,000 to $162,611,000. Operating expenses for Established Communities increased $989,000, or 2.0% to $51,518,000.

Development and Redevelopment Activity
The Company completed the development of one community during the second quarter of 2007. Avalon Shrewsbury, located in Shrewsbury, MA, is a garden-style community containing 251 apartment homes and was completed for a Total Capital Cost of $35,900,000.
In addition, the Company commenced construction on four communities during the second quarter of 2007: Avalon White Plains, a high-rise community located in Westchester County, NY; Avalon at Tinton Falls, a garden-style community located in Central NJ; Avalon Fashion Valley, a mid-rise community located in San Diego, CA and Avalon Anaheim, a mid-rise community located in Orange County, CA. These four communities are expected to contain an aggregate of 1,021 apartment homes when completed for an estimated Total Capital Cost of $363,100,000.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company purchased a land parcel located in San Francisco, CA, adjacent to its existing Mission Bay North and Mission Bay North II communities for approximately $36,000,000. The Company expects to begin construction of a 260 apartment home, high-rise community as the third phase of this community in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Acquisition Activity
In July 2007, the Company purchased a garden-style community located in San Jose, CA adjacent to its existing Countrybrook community. This community, renamed Countrybrook II, contains 80 apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of $17,700,000. The Company will operate this community in conjunction with Countrybrook.
Disposition Activity
In July 2007, the Company sold Avalon View, located in Fishkill, NY. This community contains 288 apartment homes and was sold for a price of $54,000,000. This resulted in a GAAP gain of approximately $40,200,000 and an Economic Gain of approximately $33,200,000. The Unleveraged IRR over an approximate 14-year holding period was 18.3%.
Also in July 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell San Marino for a price of $55,000,000. We expect the sale of San Marino, a 248 apartment-home community located in San Jose, CA, to close in the third quarter of 2007.
The buyers of these assets intend to continue to operate these communities as rental apartments.
 
Investment Management Fund Activity
AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a private, discretionary investment vehicle in which the Company holds an equity interest of approximately 15%. During the second quarter of 2007, the Fund acquired Skyway Terrace, located in San Jose, CA, for a purchase price of $74,000,000. Skyway Terrace is a garden-style community containing 348 apartment homes.
In addition, during the second quarter of 2007, the Fund commenced the redevelopment of Paseo Park, located in Fremont, CA. Paseo Park contains 134 apartment homes and will be redeveloped for an expected Total Capital Cost of $5,700,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment.
In July 2007, the Fund acquired two communities, Avalon Rutherford Station and South Hills Apartments. Avalon Rutherford Station is a garden-style community containing 108 apartment homes and is located in East Rutherford, NJ. This community was acquired for a purchase price of $35,850,000. South Hills Apartments is a garden-style community containing 85 apartment homes in Los Angeles, CA. This community was acquired for a purchase price of $20,700,000.
Including the acquisition of Avalon Rutherford Station and South Hills Apartments, the Fund has invested $743,985,000 as of July 31, 2007.
Financing, Liquidity and Balance Sheet Statistics
As of June 30, 2007, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its $650,000,000 unsecured credit facility and $137,800,000 in unrestricted cash available. Leverage, calculated as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization, was 23.3% at June 30, 2007. Unencumbered NOI for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was 83.4% and Interest Coverage for the second quarter of 2007 was 4.7 times.
Revised Accounting Interpretation
As discussed in Amendment No. 1 to the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, the Company made a change related to its accounting for land leases. This change resulted in a non-cash charge to operating expenses and reduced reported FFO by $0.03 and $0.07 per share from what would have been reported for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 under the Company's prior accounting treatment. Results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 have also been restated, reducing reported FFO by $0.04 and $0.07 per share from what had previously been reported to reflect the impact of this change in land lease accounting.
Third Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial Outlook
The Company expects EPS in the range of $1.99 to $2.03 for the third quarter of 2007. Based on changes in the Company's disposition plan, the Company is revising its projected EPS to a range of $3.83 to $3.93 for the full year 2007.
The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $1.17 to $1.21 for the third quarter of 2007. The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70 for the full year 2007. The financial outlook provided for the third quarter and full year 2007 includes non-cash charges of $0.03 and $0.13 per share, respectively, related to the revised lease accounting discussed in Amendment No. 1 to the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
The Company expects to release its third quarter 2007 earnings on October 31, 2007 after the market closes. The Company expects to hold a conference call on November 1, 2007 at 11:00 AM EDT to discuss the third quarter 2007 results.

Definitions and Reconciliations
Non-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined and further explained on Attachment 14, "Definitions and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms." Attachment 14 is included in the full earnings release available at the Company's website at . This wire distribution includes only definitions and reconciliations of the following Non-GAAP financial measures:
http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
 
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the third quarter and full year of 2007 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management, net interest expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest expense, depreciation expense, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or held for sale to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
, as used within this release for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer's valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development and Redevelopment Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first year of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents Management's estimate of projected gross potential (based on leased rents for occupied homes and Market Rents, as defined below, for vacant homes) minus projected economic vacancy and adjusted for concessions. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or
Projected NOI
 
amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
Management believes that Projected NOI of the development and redevelopment communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding Management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development and Redevelopment Communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development or redevelopment is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.
Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis
A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
is calculated by the Company as the gain on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for both the six months ended June 30, 2007 as well as prior years' activities is presented in the full earnings release.
Economic Gain
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the second quarter of 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, or Development Right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. For Redevelopment Communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.
Total Capital Cost
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company's general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses. Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities. The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the holding period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.
is calculated by the Company as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization. Total Market Capitalization represents the aggregate of the market value of the Company's common stock, the market value of the Company's operating partnership units outstanding (based on the market value of the Company's common stock), the liquidation preference of the Company's preferred stock and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's debt. Management believes that Leverage can be one useful measure of a real estate operating
Leverage
 
company's long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company's total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company's common stock trades. Changes in Leverage also can influence changes in per share results. A calculation of Leverage as of June 30, 2007 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Because Leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company's stock price, which occur regularly, the Company's Leverage may change even when the Company's earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. Investors should also note that the net realizable value of the Company's assets in liquidation is not easily determinable and may differ substantially from the Company's Total Market Capitalization.
as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by either outstanding secured debt or land leases (excluding land leases with purchase options that were put in place for governmental incentives or tax abatements) as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the six months ended June 30, 2007 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year. Therefore, for 2007, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2006 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy

For Immediate News Release July 31, 2007
reported today that Net Income Available to Common Stockholders for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $48,877,000. This resulted in Earnings per Share  diluted ("EPS") of $0.61 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, compared to $0.86 for the comparable period of 2006, a per share decrease of 29.1%. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, EPS was $1.16 compared to $2.31 for the comparable period of 2006, a per share decrease of 49.8%. These decreases are primarily attributable to the gains from the sale of land and communities in 2006, partially offset by growth in income from existing and newly developed communities in 2007. Results for 2006 have been restated to reflect the non-cash charges associated with our change in the accounting for certain land leases.

For Established Communities
The following table reflects the percentage changes in rental revenue, operating expenses and NOI for Established Communities for the six months ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2006:
 
Development and Redevelopment Activity
The Company completed the development of one community during the second quarter of 2007. Avalon Shrewsbury, located in Shrewsbury, MA, is a garden-style community containing 251 apartment homes and was completed for a Total Capital Cost of $35,900,000.
In addition, the Company commenced construction on four communities during the second quarter of 2007: Avalon White Plains, a high-rise community located in Westchester County, NY; Avalon at Tinton Falls, a garden-style community located in Central NJ; Avalon Fashion Valley, a mid-rise community located in San Diego, CA and Avalon Anaheim, a mid-rise community located in Orange County, CA. These four communities are expected to contain an aggregate of 1,021 apartment homes when completed for an estimated Total Capital Cost of $363,100,000.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company purchased a land parcel located in San Francisco, CA, adjacent to its existing Mission Bay North and Mission Bay North II communities for approximately $36,000,000. The Company expects to begin construction of a 260 apartment home, high-rise community as the third phase of this community in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Acquisition Activity
In July 2007, the Company purchased a garden-style community located in San Jose, CA adjacent to its existing Countrybrook community. This community, renamed Countrybrook II, contains 80 apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of $17,700,000. The Company will operate this community in conjunction with Countrybrook.
Disposition Activity
In July 2007, the Company sold Avalon View, located in Fishkill, NY. This community contains 288 apartment homes and was sold for a price of $54,000,000. This resulted in a GAAP gain of approximately $40,200,000 and an Economic Gain of approximately $33,200,000. The Unleveraged IRR over an approximate 14-year holding period was 18.3%.
Also in July 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to sell San Marino for a price of $55,000,000. We expect the sale of San Marino, a 248 apartment-home community located in San Jose, CA, to close in the third quarter of 2007.
The buyers of these assets intend to continue to operate these communities as rental apartments.
 
 
Investment Management Fund Activity
AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a private, discretionary investment vehicle in which the Company holds an equity interest of approximately 15%. During the second quarter of 2007, the Fund acquired Skyway Terrace, located in San Jose, CA, for a purchase price of $74,000,000. Skyway Terrace is a garden-style community containing 348 apartment homes.
In addition, during the second quarter of 2007, the Fund commenced the redevelopment of Paseo Park, located in Fremont, CA. Paseo Park contains 134 apartment homes and will be redeveloped for an expected Total Capital Cost of $5,700,000, excluding costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment.
In July 2007, the Fund acquired two communities, Avalon Rutherford Station and South Hills Apartments. Avalon Rutherford Station is a garden-style community containing 108 apartment homes and is located in East Rutherford, NJ. This community was acquired for a purchase price of $35,850,000. South Hills Apartments is a garden-style community containing 85 apartment homes in Los Angeles, CA. This community was acquired for a purchase price of $20,700,000.
Including the acquisition of Avalon Rutherford Station and South Hills Apartments, the Fund has invested $743,985,000 as of July 31, 2007.
Financing, Liquidity and Balance Sheet Statistics
As of June 30, 2007, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its $650,000,000 unsecured credit facility and $137,800,000 in unrestricted cash available. Leverage, calculated as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization, was 23.3% at June 30, 2007. Unencumbered NOI for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was 83.4% and Interest Coverage for the second quarter of 2007 was 4.7 times.
Revised Accounting Interpretation
As discussed in Amendment No. 1 to the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, the Company made a change related to its accounting for land leases. This change resulted in a non-cash charge to operating expenses and reduced reported FFO by $0.03 and $0.07 per share from what would have been reported for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 under the Company's prior accounting treatment. Results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 have also been restated, reducing reported FFO by $0.04 and $0.07 per share from what had previously been reported to reflect the impact of this change in land lease accounting.
Third Quarter and Full Year 2007 Financial Outlook
The Company expects EPS in the range of $1.99 to $2.03 for the third quarter of 2007. Based on changes in the Company's disposition plan, the Company is revising its projected EPS to a range of $3.83 to $3.93 for the full year 2007.
The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $1.17 to $1.21 for the third quarter of 2007. The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70 for the full year 2007. The financial outlook provided for the third quarter and full year 2007 includes non-cash charges of $0.03 and $0.13 per share, respectively, related to the revised lease accounting discussed in Amendment No. 1 to the Company's 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.
The Company expects to release its third quarter 2007 earnings on October 31, 2007 after the market closes. The Company expects to hold a conference call on November 1, 2007 at 11:00 AM EDT to discuss the third quarter 2007 results.

Attachment 14
This release, including its attachments, contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms. The definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable. The non-GAAP financial measures referred to below should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure of liquidity or as indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"). FFO is calculated by the Company as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
 
 
Attachment 14 (continued)
, as provided within this release in the Company's outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance. A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the third quarter and full year of 2007 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management, net interest expense, general and administrative expense, joint venture income, minority interest expense, depreciation expense, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
 
Attachment 14 (continued)
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 Amounts for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 have been restated from amounts previously reported to reflect a change in accounting for land leases.
(1)
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007). A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or held for sale to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Attachment 14 (continued)
, as used within this release for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents management's estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyer's valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development and Redevelopment Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first year of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyer's valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents Management's estimate of projected gross potential (based on leased rents for occupied homes and Market Rents, as defined below, for vacant homes) minus projected economic vacancy and adjusted for concessions. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Company's share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
Projected NOI
Management believes that Projected NOI of the development and redevelopment communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding Management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development and Redevelopment Communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense). However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis. Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development or redevelopment is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful. Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow. There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.
Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis
A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
is calculated by the Company as the gain on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting. Management generally considers Economic Gain to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community. The Economic Gain for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements. A reconciliation of Economic Gain to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for both the six months ended June 30, 2007 as well as prior years' activities is presented on Attachment 13.
Economic Gain
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends. Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies. EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
 
Attachment 14 (continued)
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the second quarter of 2007 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, or Development Right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP. For Redevelopment Communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated. With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management. Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount. For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.
Total Capital Cost
is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $200  $300 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community. Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents management's estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items. For this purpose, management's projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 3.0%  3.5%. The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property. Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels. The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.
Initial Year Market Cap Rate
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company. Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Company's general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses.
 
Attachment 14 (continued)
Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for net income as a measure of our performance. Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Company's acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead. The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities. The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the holding period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.
is calculated by the Company as total debt as a percentage of Total Market Capitalization. Total Market Capitalization represents the aggregate of the market value of the Company's common stock, the market value of the Company's operating partnership units outstanding (based on the market value of the Company's common stock), the liquidation preference of the Company's preferred stock and the outstanding principal balance of the Company's debt. Management believes that Leverage can be one useful measure of a real estate operating company's long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength, because it shows an approximate relationship between a company's total debt and the current total market value of its assets based on the current price at which the Company's common stock trades. Changes in Leverage also can influence changes in per share results. A calculation of Leverage as of June 30, 2007 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Leverage
Because Leverage changes with fluctuations in the Company's stock price, which occur regularly, the Company's Leverage may change even when the Company's earnings, interest and debt levels remain stable. Investors should also note that the net realizable value of the Company's assets in liquidation is not easily determinable and may differ substantially from the Company's Total Market Capitalization.
as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by either outstanding secured debt or land leases (excluding land leases with purchase options that were put in place for governmental incentives or tax abatements) as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets. The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company. Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity. A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the six months ended June 30, 2007 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year. Therefore, for 2007, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2006 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
 
Attachment 14 (continued)
are communities that are under construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.
Development Communities
are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. For wholly-owned communities, redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community's acquisition cost. The definition of substantial redevelopment may differ for communities that are not wholly-owned.
Redevelopment Communities
are calculated by the Company as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.
Average Rental Rates
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy
as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Company's communities based on their experience in renting their communities' apartments and publicly available market data. Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.
Market Rents
represents capital expenditures that will not directly result in revenue earnings or expense savings.
Non-Revenue Generating Capex
is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.
Stabilized/Restabilized Operations
, as calculated for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities in lease-up, reflects (i) actual average leased rents for those apartments leased through the end of the quarter net of estimated stabilized concessions, (ii) estimated market rents net of comparable concessions for all unleased apartments and (iii) includes actual and estimated other rental revenue. For Development and Redevelopment Communities not yet in lease-up, Average Rent per Home reflects management's projected rents.
Average Rent per Home
are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which the Company either has an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which the Company is the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where the Company owns land to develop a new community. The Company capitalizes related predevelopment costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which future development is probable.
