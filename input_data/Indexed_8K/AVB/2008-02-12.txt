(e)  At a meeting on February 6, 2008, the
independent directors of the Board of Directors of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. who are qualified to serve on the Compensation Committee (the "Independent Directors") approved
and ratified, as follows, determinations and recommendations of the Board's Compensation Committee related to compensation arrangements for the executive officers who were named in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company's proxy statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Named Executive Officers"):
 
The following awards of cash bonus, stock options and restricted shares for the Named Executive Officers were awarded in respect of 2007 performance:
 
 
These cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards were determined in accordance with the original methodology and goals that had previously been established and described in our April 5, 2007 proxy statement for the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders with two modifications.  In its review and recommendation, the Compensation Committee adjusted the FFO measurement used in evaluating the achievement of goals so that bonuses and long-term incentive compensation were not impacted by a change by the Company during 2007 in its application of ground lease accounting.  The Committee determined that it would not be consistent with the intent and design of the bonus and long-term incentive programs to measure achievement of these goals without adjusting for the change in ground lease accounting.  The second modification was that, after review and discussion, including a review of Mr. Naughton's performance, his role in the Company, and market-based information regarding the compensation of the second most senior position at comparable REITs, Mr. Naughton's cash bonus and long-term incentive awards in respect of 2007 performance were adjusted upward, resulting in an increase of $250,000 cash, 9,036 options and 2,204 restricted shares above what his awards would otherwise have been.
 
All stock options awarded were options to purchase common stock at the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 11, 2008, the third business day after the release by the Company of its 2007 earnings and 2008 outlook press release.  In accordance with a determination made by the Compensation Committee, unlike in previous years, all stock options awarded to an employee in 2008 and thereafter will vest automatically upon the employee's departure from the Company due to death or upon termination without Cause or due to Disability (as such terms are defined in the Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended). These vesting provisions are not a new benefit for Messrs. Blair, Naughton, Sargeant and Horey, as their employment agreements currently provide that options granted to them will contain these vesting provisions.  Therefore, of the Company's Named Executive Officers, only Ms. Dunn will be affected by this general change in vesting provisions.  The revised option agreements provide that after such accelerated vesting the employee or his estate will have 12 months to exercise the vested options (or until the expiration date, if earlier).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For 2008, the following base salaries (effective March 8, 2008), cash bonus incentives, and long-term incentives were established for the Named Executive Officers:
 
 
The types of goals that will be used to determine the extent to which threshold, target or maximum performance are achieved during 2008 are not materially different fromthose used for determining 2007 performance.

For clarification, it is noted that this means that the remaining unvested portion of the Option shall terminate immediately and be of no further force or effect.
Termination at the Election of the Optionee
