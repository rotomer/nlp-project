ITEM 5.02.
DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
          
 
The Company's Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee have approved the implementation of a multiyear performance plan (the "2008 Performance Plan").  Effective June 1, 2008, awards in connection with this plan will be made to senior management and other selected officers ("2008 Performance Plan Awards").
 
2008 Performance Plan Awards are initially in the form of Deferred Stock Awards, with no dividend rights, granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1994 Plan").  These Deferred Stock Awards will be forfeited in their entirety unless the Company's total return to shareholders, consisting of stock price appreciation plus cumulative dividends without reinvestment or compounding (the "Actual TRS"), over the measurement period exceeds both (i) an Absolute TRS Target and (ii) a Relative TRS Target, as described below.
 
Each participating officer's 2008 Performance Plan Award is designated as a specified "Participation Percentage" in the plan.   If both TRS targets are exceeded at the end of the measurement period, then each participating officer will earn Deferred Stock Awards having a total value (based on the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the last day of the measurement period) equal to that officer's Participation Percentage multiplied by the Total Funding Pool.  The determination of the Total Funding Pool is described below, but in all events will not exceed $60 million.  Any unearned Deferred Stock Awards (i.e., Deferred Stock Awards in excess of the number of awards having a value equal to that officer's Participation Percentage in the Total Funding Pool) will be forfeited.  Earned Deferred Stock Awards will convert into vested unrestricted common stock (50%), and unvested restricted common stock with a one-year vesting period (50%), subject to earlier forfeiture or acceleration under certain circumstances as described below.  Dividends will be paid on both the unrestricted common stock and the restricted common stock.
 
The measurement period of the 2008 Performance Plan begins on June 1, 2008 with a starting common stock price equal to the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the twenty trading days prior to June 1, 2008.  The measurement period will end three years later, on May 31, 2011, again using a twenty day average closing price.  The measurement period will end earlier upon a change in control of the Company.
 
The Absolute TRS Target that must be exceeded during the measurement period is 32% (or a pro rated amount in the event the measurement period is less than three years due to a change in control).  The Relative TRS Target that must be exceeded is the total return performance (stock price appreciation plus cumulative dividends without reinvestment or compounding) during the measurement period of the FTSE NAREIT Apartment Index.   If the Actual TRS exceeds both the Absolute TRS Target and the Relative TRS Target, the Total Funding Pool will equal 10% of the simple average of (i) the excess shareholder value created by the Actual TRS exceeding the Absolute TRS Target and (ii) the excess shareholder value created by the Actual TRS exceeding the Relative TRS Target, provided that in no event will the Total Funding Pool exceed $60 million.
 
The Company has allocated the following Participation Percentages to the Company's named executive officers:  Bryce Blair, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 15.01%; Timothy J. Naughton, President, 12.51%; Thomas J. Sargeant, Chief Financial Officer, 5.33%; Leo S. Horey, Executive Vice President  Property Operations, 5.33%; Edward M. Schulman, Senior Vice President-General Counsel, 3.55%.  Other selected officers were awarded Participation Percentages totaling 53.27%, and a reserve of 5.0% was established for possible future 2008 Performance Plan Awards.
2008 Performance Plan Awards are subject to forfeiture or accelerated vesting under the following circumstances:
 
During the first two years (one year in the case of Messrs. Blair, Naughton, Sargeant and Horey) of the three-year performance measurement period, awards will be forfeited in full if the participant ceases to be employed by the Company under any circumstance.  If a participant's employment is terminated after the second year (the first year in the case of the aforementioned officers) as a result of death, disability (as defined in the 1994 Plan) or retirement (as defined in the 1994 Plan) or is terminated by us without cause, the participant will earn a pro rated fully vested award (i.e., unrestricted common stock) at the end of the performance period.  For example, if termination without cause occurs after two years, and if there is a performance award payout at the end of the three-year performance period, the participant will receive a 66.7% pro rated fully vested award at that time.
 
In the event of a change in control at any time, the measurement period will end and, if any Deferred Stock Awards are earned (i.e., the Total Funding Pool is determined to be greater than zero), then all earned awards will be fully vested.
 
Any unvested restricted stock awards that are issued at the end of the measurement period (i) will be forfeited before the one-year vesting period in the event the participant is terminated for cause or voluntarily terminates employment, and (ii) will accelerate and become fully vested before the one-year vesting period in the event of a termination due to death, disability, termination without cause or retirement, or in the event of a change in control.
 
All determinations, interpretations and assumptions relating to the calculation of performance and vesting relating to 2008 Performance Plan Awards will be made by the Compensation Committee.
 
The 2008 Performance Plan Awards will be made pursuant to a form of 2008 Performance Award Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report.  The foregoing summary of the 2008 Performance Plan Awards is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of award agreement.
 
2008 Performance Plan Awards will not count in the calculation of the "covered compensation" multiplier for severance purposes under the employment agreements of Messrs. Blair, Naughton, Sargeant or Horey (the "Employment Agreements").  This and other clarifications regarding the effect of a termination under the Employment Agreements on the 2008 Performance Plan Awards awarded to Messrs. Blair, Naughton, Sargeant and Horey, will be reflected in amendments to the Employment Agreements in the form filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report.

Purpose and Administration.
 
The purpose of the 2008 PP is:
(a)
          
 
to measure, during a three year period (or such lesser period as provided in this Agreement), for each share of Common Stock outstanding during such period, but only for so long as outstanding, the total return to the holder of such share from stock price appreciation plus cumulative dividends (uncompounded) (the sum of the total return on all shares so measured, the ""), and
(i)
           
Actual Return
 
to measure, with respect to the same shares outstanding during such period, but only for so long as outstanding, the total return that would have been earned had the rate of return been thirty-two percent (32%) (adjusted in the event the measurement period for a share is less than three years) (the sum of the total return on all shares so measured, the ""), and
(ii)
          
Hypothetical Absolute Return
to measure, with respect to the same shares outstanding during such period, but only for so long as outstanding, the total return that would have been earned had the rate of return been equal to the return of the NAREIT Apartment Index (stock price appreciation plus cumulative dividends (uncompounded)) (the sum of the total return on all shares so measured, the ""), and
(iii)
         
Hypothetical Relative Return
 
to award to each participant in the 2008 PP shares of Common Stock (unrestricted shares and or restricted shares, as provided in this Agreement) having a value equal to such participant's Participation Percentage multiplied by the lesser of (A) $60,000,000 or (B) ten percent (10%) multiplied by the simple average of (i) the difference between the Actual Return less the Hypothetical Absolute Return and (ii) the difference between the Actual Return less the Hypothetical Relative Return, that the participant shall not earn any portion of this Award unless the Actual Return exceeds both the Hypothetical Absolute Return and the Hypothetical Relative Return.
(iv)
         
provided
 
In performing all of these measurements, the 2008 PP provides for some simplifying assumptions and adjustments, particularly with respect to shares issued or redeemed during the measurement period, but it is not expected that any of such assumptions or adjustments will change the intent or the result of the 2008 PP meaningfully.  The Committee may authorize modifications to the calculations provided in this Agreement to the extent that the Committee believes that such modifications are necessary or desirable to better fulfill the purpose of the 2008 PP as described in this .  The Committee retains full authority to approve the final calculation of the Actual Return, the Hypothetical Absolute Return and the Hypothetical Relative Return, after giving effect to any modifications to the calculations provided herein that are approved by the Committee, and the decision of the Committee is final and binding on all participants.
Section 1(a)
 
T2008 PPthe Committee, which in the administration of 2008 PP awards in general and this Award in particular shall have all the powers and authority it has in the administration of the 1994 Plan as set forth in the 1994 Plan; that all powers of the Committee hereunder can be exercised by the full Board if the Board so elects.  The Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may make at any time any provision for lapse of forfeiture restrictions and/or accelerated vesting under this Agreement of some or all of the Grantee's unvested Award Deferred Shares or Award Restricted Shares that have not previously been forfeited.

the product of the Target Absolute Return Percentage a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days from the Effective Date to and including the date such Buyback Share was repurchased, redeemed or forfeited and the denominator of which is the number of days from but excluding June 1, 2008 to and including the Valuation Date;
(y)
  
multiplied by
 
that if the Valuation Date occurs prior to May 31, 2011 as a result of a Change of Control, then for purposes of this definition in connection with the calculation of the Absolute Performance Pool as of the Valuation Date, then the Target Absolute Return Percentage to be used in such calculation shall be reduced to thirty-two percent (32%) multiplied by the CoC Fraction.  If the Company consummates an individual issuance involving 10,000 or more Additional Shares and/or an individual repurchase, redemption or forfeiture involving 10,000 or more Buyback Shares during any calendar quarter, the Company will track the precise issuance date and value of each such individual Additional Share and/or repurchase, redemption or forfeiture date and value of each such individual Buyback Share.  If the Company consummates one or more issuances each involving less than 10,000 Additional Shares and/or repurchases, redemptions or forfeitures each involving less that 10,000 Buyback Shares during any calendar quarter, it would be impractical to track the precise issuance date and value of each such Additional Share and/or repurchase, redemption or forfeiture date and value of each such Buyback Share, and in such event (A) the Company will consider all such issuances and/or repurchases, redemptions or forfeitures (on a net basis if both issuances and repurchases, redemptions or forfeitures occur in the same quarter) to have taken place on the last day of the quarter during which such transaction or transactions occurred and (B) the Additional Share Baseline Value (if the netting of all such transactions results in a net issuance of Additional Shares) or the Buyback Value (if the netting of all such transactions results in a net repurchase, redemption or forfeiture of Buyback Shares) of the shares of Common Stock involved shall be calculated using the weighted average price at which such shares were issued and/or repurchased, redeemed or forfeited.

[Form of]
SECOND AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
 
The Employment Agreement made as of the        day of                   ,          by and between AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), and                                                  ("Executive"), as previously amended on                          ,          (the ""), is hereby further amended by this instrument (this "") as follows:
Employment Agreement
Amendment
 
1.  The Executive is entering into, on or about the date hereof, with the Company, an "AvalonBay Communities, Inc. 2008 Performance Plan Deferred Stock Award Agreement" (the "").  The execution of this Amendment by Executive is a condition to the Company entering into the Performance Plan Agreement with Executive and is one of the considerations therefor.  Defined terms used herein but not defined herein have the meanings given thereto in the Employment Agreement unless otherwise provided herein.
Performance Plan Agreement
 
2.  The definition of "Covered Compensation" in the Employment Agreement is as follows:
 
"Covered Compensation,' for any calendar year, shall mean an amount equal to the sum of (i) Executive's Base Salary for the calendar year, (ii) the cash bonus actually earned by Executive with respect to such calendar year, and (iii) the value of all stock and other equity-based compensation awards made to Executive during such calendar year.  In the event that the Company has or hereafter makes any special, mid-year or other non-routine grant of equity outside of the Company's recurring annual equity compensation programs, the value of any such mid-year, special, or additional equity based compensation shall not be included in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence and therefore shall not be included in the calculation of Covered Compensation or Covered Average Compensation, and the value of such equity shall have no impact on any cash payments made under Section 7(c) of the Agreement."
 
Executive agrees, for the purpose of eliminating any doubt, that the award of a Deferred Stock Award under the Performance Plan Agreement, and the vesting thereof or conversion thereof into unrestricted common stock of the Company or restricted common stock of the Company, and any other consideration received by Executive under the Performance Plan Agreement, is in all cases a "mid-year, special, or additional equity based compensation" that is not included in the definition of Covered Compensation under the Employment Agreement.
 
3.  The Company agrees, notwithstanding the provisions of the Performance Plan Agreement, that if (i) a termination without Cause or a Constructive Termination Without Cause, or (ii) a termination due to Disability, of Executive's employment occurs as defined in the Employment Agreement, such event shall in all circumstances constitute (i) a termination without Cause  or (ii) a termination for Disability, respectively, as defined in the Performance Plan Agreement, regardless of whether the definitions in the Performance Plan Agreement would have reached a contrary result in the absence of this Amendment.
 
4.  The vesting, measurement and payment form, value and timing of settlement that occur under the Performance Plan Agreement in the event of the Executive's death, Disability, termination without Cause, Retirement or other departure for any other reason, as set forth in the Performance Plan Agreement, shall in all events control the treatment of Executive's Deferred Stock Awards under the Performance Plan, regardless of whether the provisions of the Employment Agreement (including without limitation, Sections 7(c)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v)) would have reached a contrary result.  It is noted that the previous sentence does not modify the Company's obligation under Section 7(d) of the Employment Agreement (relating to the Partial Gross-Up Payment) to include the value received by Executive under the Performance Plan Agreement in any determination of the Partial Gross-Up Payment.
Except as amended herein, the Employment Agreement is hereby confirmed in all other respects.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Amendment is entered into this          day of                         , 2008.
