("Fund II"), a private, discretionary investment vehicle with commitments from four institutional investors and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. ("AvalonBay"). Fund II will acquire and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in AvalonBay's high barrier-to-entry markets of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and West Coast regions of the U.S. with the objective of creating value through redevelopment, enhanced operations and/or improving market fundamentals.
 
Fund II has equity commitments totaling $333 million (including a $150 million equity commitment from AvalonBay) and can employ leverage of up to 65%, allowing for an investment capacity of approximately $950 million. Fund II has a term of ten years, plus two one-year extension options.
 
Fund II will serve as the exclusive vehicle through which AvalonBay will acquire apartment communities for a period of three years from the closing date or until 90% of its committed capital is invested, subject to limited exceptions. These exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for Fund II, if any. Fund II will not include or involve AvalonBay's development activities.
 
AvalonBay will receive, in addition to any returns on its invested equity, asset management fees, property management fees and redevelopment fees. AvalonBay will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met.
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Fund II and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offering; solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The securities of Fund II have been offered in a private placement to a limited number of qualified investors and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
