Item 5.02(e)
    
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
On May 21, 2009, the stockholders of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors, approved the AvalonBay Communities, Inc. 2009 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan").  The 2009 Plan includes an authorization to issue up to 4,199,822 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share, (2,930,000 newly authorized shares plus 1,269,822 shares  available for grant as of May 21, 2009 under the Company's 1994 Stock Option and Incentive Plan ( the "1994 Plan")), pursuant to awards under the 2009 Plan.  The 2009 Plan provides for various types of equity awards to employees, officers, non-employee directors and agents of the Company and its subsidiaries.  The types of awards that may be granted under the 2009 Plan include restricted and deferred stock, incentive stock options, non-qualified options, and stock appreciation rights.  The 2009 Plan will expire on May 21, 2019.  As of the date hereof, there have been no awards, and therefore no amounts are payable under the 2009 Plan to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer or any named executive officer of the Company.
 
Attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 is the AvalonBay Communities, Inc. 2009 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.  A brief description of the 2009 Plan is included as part of Proposal 2 in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Proxy Statement"), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2009.  The descriptions of the 2009 Plan contained herein and in the Proxy Statement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the 2009 Plan.
 
Effective as of the close of business on May 21, 2009, and as part of the proposal to approve the 2009 Plan described above, the Board of Directors terminated the 1994 Plan with respect to new awards.  The 1994 Plan provided for the same types of equity awards as the 2009 Plan, and would have expired by its terms on May 8, 2011.  Outstanding awards previously granted under the 1994 Plan will not be affected by termination of the 1994 Plan, the terms of which shall continue to govern such previously granted awards.

In addition, subject to subsection (b) of this Section 1.04, the Secretary of the Corporation shall call a special meeting of the Stockholders to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of the Stockholders upon the written request of Stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting.
 
(b)
          
(1)  Any Stockholder of record seeking to have Stockholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary (the "Record Date Request Notice") by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date to determine the Stockholders entitled to request a special meeting (the "Request Record Date").  The Record Date Request Notice shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at such meeting, shall be signed by one or more Stockholders of record as of the date of signature (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the Record Date Request Notice), shall bear the date of signature of each such Stockholder (or such agent) and shall set forth all information relating to each such Stockholder and each matter proposed to be acted on at the meeting that would be required to be disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of Directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or would otherwise be required in connection with such a solicitation, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act.  Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice, the Board of Directors may fix a Request Record Date.  The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors.  If the Board of Directors, within fifteen (15) days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business on the fifteenth (15
th
) day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the Secretary.
 
(2)  In order for any Stockholder to request a special meeting to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders, one or more written requests for a special meeting (collectively, the "Special Meeting Request") signed by
Stockholders of record (or their agents duly authorized in a writing accompanying the request) as of the Request Record Date entitled to cast not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at such meeting (the "Special Meeting Percentage") shall be delivered to the Secretary.  In addition, the Special Meeting Request shall (i) set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at such meeting (which shall be limited to those lawful matters set forth in the Record Date Request Notice received by the Secretary), (ii) bear the date of signature of each such Stockholder (or other agent) signing the Special Meeting Request, (iii) set forth (A) the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's stock ledger, of each Stockholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is signed), (B) the class, series and number of all shares of Stock of the Corporation which are owned (beneficially or of record) by such Stockholder and (C) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares of Stock of the Corporation owned beneficially but not of record by such Stockholder, (iv) be sent to the Secretary by registered mail, return receipt requested and (v) be received by the Secretary within sixty (60) days after the Request Record Date.  Any requesting Stockholder (or agent duly authorized in a writing accompanying the revocation or the Special Meeting Request) may revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary.
 
(3)  The Secretary shall inform the requesting Stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and delivering the notice of the meeting (including the Corporation's proxy materials).  The Secretary shall not be required to call a special meeting upon Stockholder request and such meeting shall not be held unless, in addition to the documents required by paragraph (2) of this Section 1.04(b), the Secretary receives payment of such reasonably estimated cost prior to the preparation and mailing or delivery of such notice of the meeting.
 
(4)  In the case of any special meeting called by the Secretary upon the request of Stockholders (a "Stockholder-Requested Meeting"), such meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors; , , that the date of any Stockholder-Requested Meeting shall be not more than ninety (90) days after the record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"); and provided further that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within fifteen (15) days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received by the Secretary (the "Delivery Date"), a date and time for a Stockholder-Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time on the ninetieth (90
provided
however
th
) day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such ninetieth (90
th
) day is not a Business Day, on the first preceding Business Day; and provided further that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Stockholder Requested Meeting within fifteen (15) days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.  In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for the meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.  In the case of any Stockholder-Requested Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within thirty (30) days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the thirtieth (30
th
) day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date.  The Board of Directors
may revoke the notice for any Stockholder-Requested Meeting in the event that the requesting stockholders fail to comply with the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Section 1.04(b).
 
(5)  If written revocations of the Special Meeting Request have been delivered to the Secretary and the result is that Stockholders of record (or their agents duly authorized in writing), as of the Request Record Date, entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage have delivered, and not revoked, requests for a special meeting to the Secretary:  (i) if the notice of the meeting has not already been delivered, the Secretary shall refrain from delivering the notice of the meeting and send to all requesting Stockholders who have not revoked such requests written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting, or (ii) if the notice of meeting has been delivered and if the Secretary first sends to all requesting Stockholders who have not revoked requests for a special meeting on a matter written notice of any revocation of a request for the special meeting and written notice of the Corporation's intention to revoke the notice of the meeting or for the Presiding Officer to adjourn the meeting without action on the matter, (A) the Secretary may revoke the notice of the meeting at any time before ten days before the commencement of the meeting or (B) the Presiding Officer may call the meeting to order and adjourn the meeting without acting on the matter.  Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by the Secretary of a notice of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new special meeting.
 
(6)  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President, the Chief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors may appoint regionally or nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections to act as the agent of the Corporation for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of any purported Special Meeting Request received by the Secretary.  For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such purported Special Meeting Request shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Secretary until the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Secretary of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid requests received by the Secretary represent, as of the Request Record Date, Stockholders of record entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage.  Nothing contained in this paragraph (6) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation or any Stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during or after such five (5) Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
(7)  For purposes of these Bylaws, "Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.
 
1.05
        
NOTICE
.  Not fewer than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90) days before the date of each meeting of Stockholders, the Secretary shall give to each Stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting and to each Stockholder not entitled to vote who is entitled to notice of the meeting notice in writing or electronic transmission, stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the purpose for which the meeting is called.  A single notice to all Stockholders who share an address shall be effective as to any Stockholder at such address who consents to such notice or after having been notified
 
of the Corporation's intent to give a single notice fails to object in writing to such single notice within sixty (60) days.  Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more Stockholders, or any irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting fixed in accordance with these Bylaws, or the validity of any proceedings at any such meeting.  The Corporation may postpone or cancel a meeting of Stockholders by making a public announcement of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting.  Notice of the date to which the meeting is postponed shall be given not less than ten days prior to such date and otherwise in the manner set forth in this section.
 
1.06
        
SCOPE OF NOTICE
.  No business shall be transacted at a special meeting of Stockholders except such business that is specifically designated in the notice of the meeting.  Subject to the provisions of Section 1.03, any business of the Corporation may be transacted at the annual meeting without being specifically designated in the notice, except such business as is required by any statute to be stated in such notice.
 
1.07
        
QUORUM
.  At any meeting of Stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of Stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting on any matter shall constitute a quorum; but this Section 1.07 shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the charter of the Corporation, as amended from time to time (the "Charter"), for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure.  If, however, such quorum shall not be present at any meeting of Stockholders, the Presiding Officer may adjourn the meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the meeting.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  The Stockholders present either in person or by proxy, at a meeting which has been duly called and at which a quorum was established, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Stockholders to leave fewer than were required to establish a quorum.
 
1.08
        
VOTING
.  A majority of the votes cast at a meeting of Stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to take or authorize action upon any matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes cast is specifically required by statute, the Charter or these Bylaws. Unless otherwise provided by statute or by the Charter, each outstanding share (a "Share") of Stock of the Corporation, regardless of class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of Stockholders.  Any holder of shares entitled to vote on any matter may vote part of the shares in favor of the proposal and refrain from voting the remaining shares or, other than elections to office, vote them against the proposal but, if the Stockholder fails to specify the number of shares such Stockholder is voting affirmatively, it shall be conclusively presumed that the Stockholder's approving vote is with respect to all votes said Stockholder is entitled to cast.  Shares of its own Stock directly or indirectly owned by the Corporation shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding Shares entitled to vote at any given time, but Shares of its own voting Stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity may be voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding Shares at any given time.

The provisions of this Section 7.01 shall constitute a contract with each Indemnified Person who serves at any time while these provisions are in effect and may be modified adversely only with the consent of affected Indemnified Persons and each such Indemnified Person shall be deemed to be serving as such in reliance on these provisions.

Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its Stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the MGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its Stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

For purposes of this limitation, the shares of Stock underlying any Awards under this Plan or awards under the Company's 1994 Stock Incentive Plan that are forfeited, canceled or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) shall be added back to the shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares of Stock shall not be added to the shares authorized for grant under the Plan:  (1) shares tendered or held back upon exercise of an Option or settlement of an Award to cover the exercise price or tax withholding, and (2) shares subject to a Stock Appreciation Right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the Stock Appreciation Right upon exercise thereof.

The grant of an Option or a Stock Appreciation Right shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the number of shares of Stock available for issuance under Section 3(a), as an Award for one share of Stock for each such share of Stock actually subject to the Award.  Any forfeitures, cancellation or other termination of such Awards shall be returned to the reserved pool of shares of Stock under the Plan in the same manner.
 
(c)

The Administrator shall also make equitable or proportionate adjustments in the number of shares subject to outstanding Awards and the exercise price and/or the terms of outstanding Awards to take into consideration cash dividends declared and paid other than in the ordinary course or any other extraordinary corporate event, other than those contemplated by Section 3(d) hereof, to the extent determined to be necessary by the Administrator to avoid distortion in the value of the Awards.  The adjustment by the Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive.  No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued under the Plan resulting from any such adjustment, but the Administrator in its discretion may make a cash payment in lieu of fractional shares.
 
(d)
          
Mergers and Other Transactions
.  Except as the Administrator may otherwise specify with respect to particular Awards in the relevant Award Certificate, in the case of and subject to the consummation of a Sale Event, the Plan and all outstanding Awards granted hereunder shall terminate, unless provision is made in connection with the Sale Event in the sole discretion of the parties thereto for the assumption or continuation of Awards theretofore granted by the successor entity, or the substitution of such Awards with new Awards of the successor entity or parent thereof, with appropriate adjustment as to the number and kind of shares and, if appropriate, the per share exercise prices, as such parties shall agree (after taking into account
 
any acceleration hereunder).  In the event of such termination, (i) the Company shall have the option (in its sole discretion) to make or provide for a cash payment to the grantees holding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, in exchange for the cancellation thereof, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the Sale Price multiplied by the number of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (to the extent then exercisable (after taking into account any acceleration hereunder) at prices not in excess of the Sale Price) and (B) the aggregate exercise price of all such outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights; or (ii) each grantee shall be permitted, within a specified period of time prior to the consummation of the Sale Event as determined by the Administrator, to exercise all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights held by such grantee.
 
(e)
          
Substitute Awards

The Administrator may direct that the substitute awards be granted on such terms and conditions as the Administrator considers appropriate in the circumstances.  Any substitute Awards granted under the Plan shall not count against the share limitation set forth in Section 3(a).
 
 
Grantees under the Plan will be such full or part-time officers and other employees, Non-Employee Directors and key persons (including consultants and prospective employees) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as are selected from time to time by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

To the extent that any Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall be deemed a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
 
The Administrator in its discretion may grant Stock Options to eligible employees and key persons of the Company or any Subsidiary.  Stock Options granted pursuant to this Section 5(a) shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator shall deem desirable.  If the Administrator so determines, Stock Options may be granted in lieu of cash compensation at the optionee's election, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may establish.
 
(b)
          
Exercise Price
.  The exercise price per share for the Stock covered by a Stock Option granted pursuant to this Section 5(b) shall be determined by the Administrator at the time
of grant but shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value on the date of grant.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the option price of such Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value on the grant date.
 
(c)
          
Option Term
.  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Administrator, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date the Stock Option is granted.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to a Ten Percent Owner, the term of such Stock Option shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.
 
(d)
          
Exercisability; Rights of a Stockholder
.  Stock Options shall become exercisable at such time or times, whether or not in installments, as shall be determined by the Administrator at or after the grant date.

(iii)
         
By the optionee delivering to the Company a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company cash or a check payable and acceptable to the Company for the purchase price; provided that in the event the optionee chooses to pay the purchase price as so provided, the optionee and the broker shall comply with such procedures and enter into such agreements of indemnity and other agreements as the Administrator shall prescribe as a condition of such payment procedure; or
 
(iv)
         
With respect to Stock Options that are not Incentive Stock Options, by a "net exercise" arrangement pursuant to which the Company will reduce the number of shares of Stock issuable upon exercise by the largest whole number of shares with a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price.
 
Payment instruments will be received subject to collection.  The transfer to the optionee on the records of the Company or of the transfer agent of the shares of Stock to be purchased pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option will be contingent upon receipt from the optionee (or a purchaser acting in his stead in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Option) by the Company of the full purchase price for such shares and the fulfillment of any other requirements contained in the Option Award Certificate or applicable provisions of laws (including the satisfaction of any withholding taxes that the Company is obligated to withhold with respect to
the optionee).  In the event an optionee chooses to pay the purchase price by previously-owned shares of Stock through the attestation method, the number of shares of Stock transferred to the optionee upon the exercise of the Stock Option shall be net of the number of attested shares.  In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the exercise of Stock Options, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless exercise of Stock Options may be permitted through the use of such an automated system.
 
(f)
           
Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options
.  To the extent required for "incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the shares of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or its parent and subsidiary corporations become exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000.  To the extent that any Stock Option exceeds this limit, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
 
 
(a)
          
Exercise Price of Stock Appreciation Rights
.  The exercise price of a Stock Appreciation Right shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of grant.
 
(b)
          
Grant and Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights
.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted by the Administrator independently of any Stock Option granted pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan.
 
(c)
          
Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights
.  Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined from time to time by the Administrator.  The term of a Stock Appreciation Right may not exceed ten years.
 
 
(a)
          
Nature of Restricted Stock Awards
.  The Administrator shall determine the restrictions and conditions applicable to each Restricted Stock Award at the time of grant.  Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives.  The terms and conditions of each such Award Certificate shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees.
 
(b)
          
Rights as a Stockholder
.  Upon the grant of the Restricted Stock Award and payment of any applicable purchase price, a grantee shall have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the voting and dividends of the Restricted Stock, subject to such conditions contained in the Restricted Stock Award Certificate.  Unless the Administrator shall otherwise determine, (i) uncertificated Restricted Stock shall be accompanied by a notation on the records of the Company or the transfer agent to the effect that they are subject to forfeiture until such Restricted Stock are vested as provided in Section 7(d) below, and (ii) certificated Restricted Stock shall remain in the possession of the Company until such Restricted Stock is vested as provided in
Section 7(d) below, and the grantee shall be required, as a condition of the grant, to deliver to the Company such instruments of transfer as the Administrator may prescribe.
 
(c)
          
Restrictions
.  Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of except as specifically provided herein or in the Restricted Stock Award Certificate.  Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, if a grantee's employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason, any Restricted Stock that has not vested at the time of termination shall automatically and without any requirement of notice to such grantee from or other action by or on behalf of, the Company be deemed to have been reacquired by the Company at its original purchase price (if any) from such grantee or such grantee's legal representative simultaneously with such termination of employment (or other service relationship), and thereafter shall cease to represent any ownership of the Company by the grantee or rights of the grantee as a stockholder.  Following such deemed reacquisition of unvested Restricted Stock that are represented by physical certificates, a grantee shall surrender such certificates to the Company upon request without consideration.
 
(d)
          
Vesting of Restricted Stock
.  The Administrator at the time of grant shall specify the date or dates and/or the attainment of pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions on which the non-transferability of the Restricted Stock and the Company's right of repurchase or forfeiture shall lapse.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such Restricted Stock granted to employees shall have a performance-based goal, the restriction period with respect to such shares shall not be less than one year, and in the event any such Restricted Stock granted to employees shall have a time-based restriction only (without any prior performance condition to the grant or vesting thereof), the total restriction period with respect to such shares shall not be less than three years; provided, however, that Restricted Stock with a time-based restriction may become vested incrementally over such three-year period.  Subsequent to such date or dates and/or the attainment of such pre-established performance goals, objectives and other conditions, the shares on which all restrictions have lapsed shall no longer be Restricted Stock and shall be deemed "vested."  Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, a grantee's rights in any shares of Restricted Stock that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or other service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries and such shares shall be subject to the provisions of Section 7(c) above.
 
 
(a)
          
Nature of Restricted Stock Units
.  The Administrator shall determine the restrictions and conditions applicable to each Restricted Stock Unit at the time of grant.  Conditions may be based on continuing employment (or other service relationship) and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals and objectives.  The terms and conditions of each such Award Certificate shall be determined by the Administrator, and such terms and conditions may differ among individual Awards and grantees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any such Restricted Stock Units granted to employees shall have a performance-based goal, the restriction period with respect to such Award shall not be less than one year, and
 
in the event any such Restricted Stock Units granted to employees shall have a time-based restriction only (without any prior performance condition to the grant or vesting thereof), the total restriction period with respect to such Award shall not be less than three years; provided, however, that any Restricted Stock Units with a time-based restriction may become vested incrementally over such three-year period.  At the end of the deferral period, the Restricted Stock Units, to the extent vested, shall be settled in the form of shares of Stock.  To the extent that an award of Restricted Stock Units is subject to Section 409A, it may contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion in order for such Award to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.
 
(b)
                                
Election to Receive Restricted Stock Units in Lieu of Compensation
.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a grantee to elect to receive a portion of future cash compensation otherwise due to such grantee in the form of an award of Restricted Stock Units.  Any such election shall be made in writing and shall be delivered to the Company no later than the date specified by the Administrator and in accordance with Section 409A and such other rules and procedures established by the Administrator.  Any such future cash compensation that the grantee elects to defer shall be converted to a fixed number of Restricted Stock Units based on the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date the compensation would otherwise have been paid to the grantee if such payment had not been deferred as provided herein.  The Administrator shall have the sole right to determine whether and under what circumstances to permit such elections and to impose such limitations and other terms and conditions thereon as the Administrator deems appropriate.  Any Restricted Stock Units that are elected to be received in lieu of cash compensation shall be fully vested, unless otherwise provided in the Award Certificate.
 
(c)
                                 
Rights as a Stockholder
.  A grantee shall have the rights as a stockholder only as to shares of Stock acquired by the grantee upon settlement of Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that the grantee may be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the phantom stock units underlying his Restricted Stock Units, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine.
 
(d)
                                
Termination
.  Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, a grantee's right in all Restricted Stock Units that have not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.
 
SECTION 9. 
UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
 
Grant or Sale of Unrestricted Stock
.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at par value or such higher purchase price determined by the Administrator) an Unrestricted Stock Award under the Plan.  Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of cash compensation due to such grantee.
 
SECTION 10. 
CASH-BASED AWARDS
 
Grant of Cash-Based Awards
.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant Cash-Based Awards to any grantee in such number or amount and upon such terms, and subject to
 
such conditions, as the Administrator shall determine at the time of grant.  The Administrator shall determine the maximum duration of the Cash-Based Award, the amount of cash to which the Cash-Based Award pertains, the conditions upon which the Cash-Based Award shall become vested or payable, and such other provisions as the Administrator shall determine.  Each Cash-Based Award shall specify a cash-denominated payment amount, formula or payment ranges as determined by the Administrator.  Payment, if any, with respect to a Cash-Based Award shall be made in accordance with the terms of the Award and may be made in cash or in shares of Stock, as the Administrator determines.
 
SECTION 11. 
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS
 
(a)
                                 
Nature of Performance Share Awards
.  The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, grant Performance Share Awards independent of, or in connection with, the granting of any other Award under the Plan.  The Administrator shall determine whether and to whom Performance Share Awards shall be granted, the Performance Goals, the periods during which performance is to be measured, which may not be less than one year, and such other limitations and conditions as the Administrator shall determine.
 
(b)
                                
Rights as a Stockholder
.  A grantee receiving a Performance Share Award shall have the rights of a stockholder only as to shares actually received by the grantee under the Plan and not with respect to shares subject to the Award but not actually received by the grantee.  A grantee shall be entitled to receive shares of Stock under a Performance Share Award only upon satisfaction of all conditions specified in the Performance Share Award Certificate (or in a performance plan adopted by the Administrator).
 
(c)
                                 
Termination
.  Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award agreement or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, a grantee's rights in all Performance Share Awards shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.
 
SECTION 12. 
PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS TO COVERED EMPLOYEES
 
(a)
                                 
Performance-Based Awards
.  Any employee or other key person providing services to the Company and who is selected by the Administrator may be granted one or more Performance-Based Awards in the form of a Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Share Awards or Cash-Based Award payable upon the attainment of Performance Goals that are established by the Administrator and related to one or more of the Performance Criteria, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Administrator.  The Administrator shall define in an objective fashion the manner of calculating the Performance Criteria it selects to use for any Performance Cycle.  Depending on the Performance Criteria used to establish such Performance Goals, the Performance Goals may be expressed in terms of overall Company performance or the performance of a division, business unit, or an individual.  The Administrator, in its discretion, may adjust or modify the calculation of Performance Goals for such Performance Cycle in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the rights of an individual (i) in the event of, or in anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event or development, (ii) in recognition of, or in
 
anticipation of, any other unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or (iii) in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles, or business conditions provided however, that the Administrator may not exercise such discretion in a manner that would increase the Performance-Based Award granted to a Covered Employee.  Each Performance-Based Award shall comply with the provisions set forth below.
 
(b)
                                
Grant of Performance-Based Awards
.  With respect to each Performance-Based Award granted to a Covered Employee, the Administrator shall select, within the first 90 days of a Performance Cycle (or, if shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code) the Performance Criteria for such grant, and the Performance Goals with respect to each Performance Criterion (including a threshold level of performance below which no amount will become payable with respect to such Award).  Each Performance-Based Award will specify the amount payable, or the formula for determining the amount payable, upon achievement of the various applicable performance targets.  The Performance Criteria established by the Administrator may be (but need not be) different for each Performance Cycle and different Performance Goals may be applicable to Performance-Based Awards to different Covered Employees.
 
(c)
                                 
Payment of Performance-Based Awards
.  Following the completion of a Performance Cycle, the Administrator shall meet to review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for the Performance Cycle have been achieved and, if so, to also calculate and certify in writing the amount of the Performance-Based Awards earned for the Performance Cycle.  The Administrator shall then determine the actual size of each Covered Employee's Performance-Based Award, and, in doing so, may reduce or eliminate the amount of the Performance-Based Award for a Covered Employee if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate.
 
(d)
                                
Maximum Award Payable
.  The maximum Performance-Based Award payable to any one Covered Employee under the Plan for a Performance Cycle is 300,000 shares of Stock (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3(c) hereof) or $4 million in the case of a Performance-Based Award that is a Cash-Based Award.
 
SECTION 13. 
DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS
 
(a)
                                 
Dividend Equivalent Rights
.  A Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any grantee as a component of an award of Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock Award or as a freestanding award.  The terms and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the Award Certificate.  Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may be paid currently or may be deemed to be reinvested in additional shares of Stock, which may thereafter accrue additional equivalents.  Any such reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date of reinvestment or such other price as may then apply under a dividend reinvestment plan sponsored by the Company, if any.  Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or shares of Stock or a combination thereof, in a single installment or installments.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of an award of Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Stock Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be settled upon settlement or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on, such other Award, and that
 
such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other Award.  A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of a Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Stock Award may also contain terms and conditions different from such other Award.
 
(b)
                                
Interest Equivalents
.  Any Award under this Plan that is settled in whole or in part in cash on a deferred basis may provide in the grant for interest equivalents to be credited with respect to such cash payment.  Interest equivalents may be compounded and shall be paid upon such terms and conditions as may be specified by the grant.
 
(c)
                                 
Termination
.  Except as may otherwise be provided by the Administrator either in the Award Certificate or, subject to Section 18 below, in writing after the Award is issued, a grantee's rights in all Dividend Equivalent Rights or interest equivalents granted as a component of an award of Restricted Stock Units or Restricted Stock Award that has not vested shall automatically terminate upon the grantee's termination of employment (or cessation of service relationship) with the Company and its Subsidiaries for any reason.
 
SECTION 14. 
TRANSFERABILITY OF AWARDS
 
(a)
                                 
Transferability
.  Except as provided in Section 14(b) below, during a grantee's lifetime, his or her Awards shall be exercisable only by the grantee, or by the grantee's legal representative or guardian in the event of the grantee's incapacity.  No Awards shall be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by a grantee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order.  No Awards shall be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or levy of any kind, and any purported transfer in violation hereof shall be null and void.
 
(b)
                                
Administrator Action
.  Notwithstanding Section 14(a), the Administrator, in its discretion, may provide either in the Award Certificate regarding a given Award or by subsequent written approval that the grantee (who is an employee or director) may transfer his or her Awards (other than any Incentive Stock Options or Restricted Stock Units) to his or her immediate family members, to trusts for the benefit of such family members, or to partnerships in which such family members are the only partners, provided that the transferee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan and the applicable Award.
 
(c)
                                 
Family Member
.  For purposes of Section 14(b), "family member" shall mean a grantee's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, including adoptive relationships, any person sharing the grantee's household (other than a tenant of the grantee), a trust in which these persons (or the grantee) have more than 50 percent of the beneficial interest, a foundation in which these persons (or the grantee) control the management of assets, and any other entity in which these persons (or the grantee) own more than 50 percent of the voting interests.
 
(d)
                                
Designation of Beneficiary
.  Each grantee to whom an Award has been made under the Plan may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise any Award or receive any
 
payment under any Award payable on or after the grantee's death.  Any such designation shall be on a form provided for that purpose by the Administrator and shall not be effective until received by the Administrator.  If no beneficiary has been designated by a deceased grantee, or if the designated beneficiaries have predeceased the grantee, the beneficiary shall be the grantee's estate.
 
SECTION 15. 
TAX WITHHOLDING
 
(a)
                                 
Payment by Grantee
.  Each grantee shall, no later than the date as of which the value of an Award or of any Stock or other amounts received thereunder first becomes includable in the gross income of the grantee for Federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator regarding payment of, any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect to such income.  The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the grantee.  The Company's obligation to deliver evidence of book entry (or stock certificates) to any grantee is subject to and conditioned on tax withholding obligations being satisfied by the grantee.
 
(b)
                                
Payment in Stock
.  Subject to approval by the Administrator, a grantee may elect to have the Company's minimum required tax withholding obligation satisfied, in whole or in part, by authorizing the Company to withhold from shares of Stock to be issued pursuant to any Award a number of shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date the withholding is effected) that would satisfy the withholding amount due.
 
SECTION 16. 
SECTION 409A AWARDS
 
To the extent that any Award is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A (a "409A Award"), the Award shall be subject to such additional rules and requirements as specified by the Administrator from time to time in order to comply with Section 409A.  In this regard, if any amount under a 409A Award is payable upon a "separation from service" (within the meaning of Section 409A) to a grantee who is then considered a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), then no such payment shall be made prior to the date that is the earlier of (i) six months and one day after the grantee's separation from service, or (ii) the grantee's death, but only to the extent such delay is necessary to prevent such payment from being subject to interest, penalties and/or additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A.  Further, the settlement of any such Award may not be accelerated or postponed except to the extent permitted by Section 409A.
 
SECTION 17. 
TRANSFER, LEAVE OF ABSENCE, ETC.
 
For purposes of the Plan, the following events shall not be deemed a termination of employment:
 
(a)
                                 
a transfer to the employment of the Company from a Subsidiary or from the Company to a Subsidiary, or from one Subsidiary to another; or
 
(b)
                                
an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee's right to re-employment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Administrator otherwise so provides in writing.
 
SECTION 18. 
AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION
 
The Board may, at any time, amend or discontinue the Plan and the Administrator may, at any time, amend or cancel any outstanding Award for the purpose of satisfying changes in law or for any other lawful purpose, but no such action shall adversely affect rights under any outstanding Award without the holder's consent.  Except as provided in Section 3(c) or 3(d), without prior stockholder approval, in no event may the Administrator exercise its discretion to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or effect repricing through cancellation and re-grants.  To the extent required under the rules of any securities exchange or market system on which the Stock is listed, to the extent determined by the Administrator to be required by the Code to ensure that Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan are qualified under Section 422 of the Code, or to ensure that compensation earned under Awards qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, Plan amendments shall be subject to approval by the Company stockholders entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders.  Nothing in this Section 18 shall limit the Administrator's authority to take any action permitted pursuant to Section 3(c) or 3(d).
 
SECTION 19. 
STATUS OF PLAN
 
With respect to the portion of any Award that has not been exercised and any payments in cash, Stock or other consideration not received by a grantee, a grantee shall have no rights greater than those of a general creditor of the Company unless the Administrator shall otherwise expressly determine in connection with any Award or Awards.  In its sole discretion, the Administrator may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations to deliver Stock or make payments with respect to Awards hereunder, provided that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the foregoing sentence.
 
SECTION 20. 
GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
(a)
                                 
No Distribution
.  The Administrator may require each person acquiring Stock pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof.
 
(b)
                                
Delivery of Stock Certificates
.  Stock certificates to grantees under this Plan shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a stock transfer agent of the Company shall have mailed such certificates in the United States mail, addressed to the grantee, at the grantee's last known address on file with the Company.  Uncertificated Stock shall be deemed delivered for all purposes when the Company or a Stock transfer agent of the Company shall have given to the grantee by electronic mail (with proof of receipt) or by United States mail, addressed to the grantee, at the grantee's last known address on file with the Company, notice of issuance and recorded the issuance in its records (which may include electronic "book entry" records).  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be
 
required to issue or deliver any certificates evidencing shares of Stock pursuant to the exercise of any Award, unless and until the Administrator has determined, with advice of counsel (to the extent the Administrator deems such advice necessary or advisable), that the issuance and delivery of such certificates is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authorities and, if applicable, the requirements of any exchange on which the shares of Stock are listed, quoted or traded.  All Stock certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to any stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to comply with federal, state or foreign jurisdiction, securities or other laws, rules and quotation system on which the Stock is listed, quoted or traded.  The Administrator may place legends on any Stock certificate to reference restrictions applicable to the Stock.  In addition to the terms and conditions provided herein, the Administrator may require that an individual make such reasonable covenants, agreements, and representations as the Administrator, in its discretion, deems necessary or advisable in order to comply with any such laws, regulations, or requirements.  The Administrator shall have the right to require any individual to comply with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation, as may be imposed in the discretion of the Administrator.
 
(c)
                                 
Stockholder Rights
.  Until Stock is deemed delivered in accordance with Section 20(b), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights of a stockholder will exist with respect to shares of Stock to be issued in connection with an Award, notwithstanding the exercise of a Stock Option or any other action by the grantee with respect to an Award.
 
(d)
                                
Other Compensation Arrangements; No Employment Rights
.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, including trusts, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.  The adoption of this Plan and the grant of Awards do not confer upon any employee any right to continued employment with the Company or any Subsidiary.
 
(e)
                                 
Trading Policy Restrictions
.  Option exercises and other Awards under the Plan shall be subject to the Company's insider trading policies and procedures, as in effect from time to time.
 
(f)
                                   
Forfeiture of Awards under Sarbanes-Oxley Act
.  If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, then, to the extent required by law, any grantee who is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall reimburse the Company for the amount of any Award received by such individual under the Plan during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement.
 
SECTION 21. 
EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN
 
This Plan shall become effective upon approval by the stockholders in accordance with applicable state law, the Company's bylaws and articles of incorporation and the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange.  No grants of Stock Options and other Awards may be made hereunder after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date and no grants of Incentive Stock Options may be made hereunder after the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan is approved by the Board.
 
SECTION 22.

This Plan and all Awards and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, applied without regard to conflict of law principles.
