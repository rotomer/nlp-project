Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
In connection with the commencement of a "continuous equity" offering under which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company") may sell up to an aggregate amount of $400 million of shares of its common stock (the "Shares") from time to time during a three-year period in "at the market" offerings or certain other transactions (the "Offering"), the Company today filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a prospectus supplement dated August 12, 2009 (the "Prospectus Supplement").  The Company may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company from time to time, but has no obligation to sell any of the Shares in the Offering.  Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company.
 
The Offering will occur pursuant to three separate sales agency financing agreements (individually, a "Sales Agreement" and together, the "Sales Agreements") entered into by the Company with each of BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as agents for the offer and sale of the Shares (individually, a "Sales Agent" and together, the "Sales Agents").  Each Sales Agreement has a three-year term and provides that the Company may offer and sell from time to time pursuant to the Sales Agreements up to a combined total of $400,000,000 of shares of its common stock during such three-year term through the Sales Agents. The Sales Agreements provide that each Sales Agent will be entitled to compensation up to 2.0% of the gross sales price per share for any of the Shares sold under the relevant Sales Agreement.
 
Sales of the Shares, if any, under the Sales Agreements may be made in transactions that are deemed to be "at the market offerings" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange, as well as in negotiated or other transactions described in the Prospectus Supplement.   The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Shares in the Offering, and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the sales agency financing agreements or terminate the sales agency financing agreements.
 
The Shares will be issued pursuant to the Prospectus Supplement and the Company's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-157627) filed on March 2, 2009 with the SEC.  This Current Report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration of qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
 
The Sales Agreements are filed as Exhibits 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 to this Current Report.  The description of the Sales Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Sales Agreements filed herewith as exhibits to the Current Report.

Delivery of Issuance Notice
 
(c)           .  BNYMCM shall not sell Common Shares below the Floor Price during any Selling Period and such Floor Price may be adjusted by the Company at any time during any Selling Period upon notice to BNYMCM and confirmation to the Company.

Trading Guidelines
 
Section 2.04           .  Subject to the provisions of Article V, on or before each Settlement Date, the Company will, or will cause its transfer agent to, electronically transfer the Issuance Shares being sold by crediting BNYMCM or its designee's account at the Depository Trust Company through its Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) System, or by such other means of delivery as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto and, upon receipt of such Issuance Shares, which in all cases shall be freely tradeable, transferable, registered shares in good deliverable form, BNYMCM will deliver the related Issuance Price in same day funds delivered to an account designated by the Company prior to the Settlement Date.

Alternative Sales Agents
 
Section 2.07           .

Indemnification by BNYMCM
Section 6.03           .  Promptly after receipt by any Person (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6.01 or 6.02, the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (an "Indemnifying Party"), notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the claim or the commencement of such action.  In the event an Indemnified Party shall fail to give such notice as provided in this Section 6.03 and the Indemnifying Party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and  was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, the indemnification provided for in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 shall be reduced to the extent of any actual prejudice resulting from such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party otherwise than under Section 6.01 or 6.02. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified Indemnifying Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.  After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnified Party, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) such Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Company, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related claims or actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of each such Indemnified Party from all losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of such claim or proceeding and such settlement does not admit or constitute an admission of fault, guilt, failure to act or culpability on the part of any such Indemnified Party. Whether or not the defense of any claim or action is assumed by an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
 
Section 6.04           .  If for any reason the indemnification provided for in this Article VI is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as between the Company, on the one hand,
Contribution
and BNYMCM, on the other hand, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and BNYMCM on the other hand from the offering of the Common Shares to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnifying Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of BNYMCM in connection with such statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by BNYMCM, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Common Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by BNYMCM in respect thereof.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of BNYMCM, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on one hand or by BNYMCM on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and BNYMCM agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, BNYMCM shall in no event be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by it under this Agreement.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6.04 each officer, director, employee and agent of BNYMCM, and each Controlling Person, shall have the same rights to contribution as BNYMCM, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The obligations of the Company and BNYMCM under this Article VI shall be in addition to any liability that the Company and BNYMCM may otherwise have.
 
Section 7.01           .  Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, the term of this Agreement shall run until the end of the Commitment Period.

The Company may issue a press release describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and may file with the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the material terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall consult with BNYMCM prior to making such disclosures, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosures that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties. No party hereto shall issue thereafter any press release or like public statement (including, without limitation,  any disclosure required in reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act) related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby that includes information related to this Agreement or transactions contemplated hereby that has not previously been disclosed without the prior written approval of the other party hereto, except as may be necessary or appropriate in the opinion of the party seeking to make disclosure to comply with the requirements of applicable law or stock exchange rules. If any such press release or like public statement is so required, the party making such disclosure shall consult with the other party prior to making such disclosure, and the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, acting in good faith, to agree upon a text for such disclosure that is reasonably satisfactory to all parties.

Person of the Company, for any reasonable legal and other expenses incurred thereby in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions or proceedings in respect thereof.
 
Section 6.03           .  Promptly after receipt by any Person (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6.01 or 6.02, the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (an "Indemnifying Party"), notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the claim or the commencement of such action.  In the event an Indemnified Party shall fail to give such notice as provided in this Section 6.03 and the Indemnifying Party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and  was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, the indemnification provided for in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 shall be reduced to the extent of any actual prejudice resulting from such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party otherwise than under Section 6.01 or 6.02. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified Indemnifying Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.  After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnified Party, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) such Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Company, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related claims or actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of each such Indemnified Party from all losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of such claim or proceeding and such settlement does not admit or constitute an admission of fault, guilt, failure to act or culpability on the part of any such Indemnified Party. Whether or not the defense of any claim or action is assumed by an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
Section 6.04           .  If for any reason the indemnification provided for in this Article VI is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as between the Company, on the one hand, and Deutsche Bank, on the other hand, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and Deutsche Bank on the other hand from the offering of the Common Shares to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnifying Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of Deutsche Bank in connection with such statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by Deutsche Bank, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Common Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by Deutsche Bank in respect thereof.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of Deutsche Bank, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on one hand or by Deutsche Bank on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
 
The Company and Deutsche Bank agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, Deutsche Bank shall in no event be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by it under this Agreement.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6.04 each officer, director, employee and agent of Deutsche Bank, and each Controlling Person, shall have the same rights to contribution as Deutsche Bank, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The obligations of the Company and Deutsche Bank under this Article VI shall be in addition to any liability that the Company and Deutsche Bank may otherwise have.

Liability; Provisions that Survive Termination
 
All representations and warranties of the Company herein or in certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of Deutsche Bank and its officers, directors, employees and agents and any Controlling Persons, (ii) delivery and acceptance of the Common Shares and payment therefor or (iii) any termination of this Agreement.

Delivery of Issuance Notice
 
(c)           .  Merrill Lynch shall not sell Common Shares below the Floor Price during any Selling Period and such Floor Price may be adjusted by the Company at any time during any Selling Period upon notice to Merrill Lynch and confirmation to the Company.

Trading Guidelines
 
Section 2.04           .

Person of the Company, for any reasonable legal and other expenses incurred thereby in investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, or actions or proceedings in respect thereof.
 
Section 6.03           .  Promptly after receipt by any Person (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6.01 or 6.02, the Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the Person against whom such indemnity may be sought (an "Indemnifying Party"), notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the claim or the commencement of such action.  In the event an Indemnified Party shall fail to give such notice as provided in this Section 6.03 and the Indemnifying Party to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and  was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice, the indemnification provided for in Sections 6.01 or 6.02 shall be reduced to the extent of any actual prejudice resulting from such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party; provided, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Party otherwise than under Section 6.01 or 6.02. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified Indemnifying Party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.  After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Indemnified Party, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be for the account of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) such Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Company, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such claim or action or separate but substantially similar or related claims or actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties or for fees and expenses that are not reasonable. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of each such Indemnified Party from all losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of such claim or proceeding and such settlement does not admit or constitute an admission of fault, guilt, failure to act or culpability on the part of any such Indemnified Party. Whether or not the defense of any claim or action is assumed by an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
Section 6.04           .  If for any reason the indemnification provided for in this Article VI is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as between the Company, on the one hand, and Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and Merrill Lynch on the other hand from the offering of the Common Shares to which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities relate.  If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each Indemnifying Party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such Indemnifying Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and of Merrill Lynch in connection with such statements or omissions, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and by Merrill Lynch, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Common Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by Merrill Lynch in respect thereof.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on one hand or by Merrill Lynch on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution
 
The Company and Merrill Lynch agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6.04 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any reasonable legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.04, Merrill Lynch shall in no event be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions received by it under this Agreement.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6.04 each officer, director, employee and agent of Merrill Lynch, and each Controlling Person, shall have the same rights to contribution as Merrill Lynch, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The obligations of the Company and Merrill Lynch under this Article VI shall be in addition to any liability that the Company and Merrill Lynch may otherwise have.
Section 7.01           .  Subject to the provisions of this Article VII, the term of this Agreement shall run until the end of the Commitment Period.

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. 2900 Eisenhower Avenue, Suite 300 Alexandria, VA 22314
 
Re:  Legality of Securities to be Registered Under Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of up to $400,000,000 of shares (the "Shares") of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, as described in the prospectus, as supplemented, relating to the Shares contained in the Company's Registration Statement (File No. 333-157627).
 
We have reviewed such documents and made such examination of law as we have deemed appropriate to give the opinions expressed below.
