For Immediate News Release
February 2, 2011
(Arlington, VA)  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE: AVB) (the Company) reported today that Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders (Net Income) for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 was $27,030,000.  This resulted in Earnings per Share  diluted (EPS) of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to EPS of $0.40 for the comparable period of 2009, a decrease of 22.5%. For the year ended December 31, 2010, EPS was $2.07 compared to $1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a per share increase of 7.3%.
The decrease in EPS for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 from the prior year period is due primarily to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, offset partially by the loss on early debt extinguishment recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010.  The increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 is due primarily to charges for early debt extinguishment and impairment of real estate assets recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010.
 
Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders - diluted (FFO) per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 increased 57.8% to $1.01 from $0.64 for the comparable period of 2009.  FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 2.8% to $4.00 from $3.89 for 2009. Adjusting for the non-routine items detailed in Attachement 17, FFO per share for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2010 would have increased by 1.0% and decreased by 11.0%, respectively, from the prior year periods.
Commenting on the Companys results, Bryce Blair, Chairman and CEO, said,
Same store NOI growth turned positive in the fourth quarter, capping a year of steady improvement. We expect that accelerating revenue growth combined with investment activity that will deliver and stabilize in 2011 will drive 16% FFO growth for the coming year. Operating fundamentals are expected to further improve, supporting our plan to start another $800 million in 2011 that will fuel future earnings and value growth.
Operating Results for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Prior Year Period
, including discontinued operations, total revenue increased by $11,356,000, or 5.1% to $232,009,000.  , rental revenue increased 2.5% due to an increase in Average Rental Rates of 2.9%, partially offset by a decrease in Economic Occupancy of 0.4%. As a result, total revenue for Established Communities increased $3,961,000 to $164,258,000. Operating expenses for Established Communities increased $938,000, or 1.7%, to $57,629,000.

2011 Financial Outlook
The following presents the Company's financial outlook for 2011, the details of which are summarized on Attachments 15 and 16.
In setting operating expectations for 2011, management considers third party macroeconomic forecasts, local market conditions and performance at individual communities. Management expects continued, moderate economic growth in 2011, strengthening throughout the year. Positive annual rental revenue growth in our Established Communities is expected in all regions, though growth in some West Coast markets may lag other regions.
Projected EPS is expected to be within a range of $3.09 to $3.34 for the full year 2011.
The Company expects 2011 Projected FFO per share to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.75 as compared to $4.00 for the full year 2010, resulting in an expected increase in FFO per share of 15.8% at the mid-point of the range.
For the first quarter of 2011, the Company expects projected EPS within a range of $0.29 to $0.33. The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the first quarter of 2011 within a range of $1.00 to $1.04.
 
 
 
 
 
In the second half of 2011, the Company expects to sell an operating community that is subject to a long-term ground lease, terminating the Companys obligation under the lease upon sale.  If the community is sold as expected, the Company will recognize an increase in its operating results for 2011 of approximately $0.10 per share.  This increase represents the net impact of eliminating the annual lease expense in excess of the cash payments, the loss of NOI from the community subsequent to the disposition and the addition of the disposition proceeds to the Companys available working capital.
The Companys 2011 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions and estimates, which are provided on Attachment 15 of this release.  The primary assumptions and estimates include the following:
Property Operations
Development
The Company did not impair any assets or abandon any material pursuits during 2010. However, the Companys focus on development of apartment communities and the existing development pipeline present a valuation risk that could result in future abandoned pursuits and/or impairment charges that are not apparent or determinable at this time.
Acquisition & Disposition Activity
Capital Markets
The Company expects to issue between $500,000,000 and $700,000,000 of new unsecured and secured debt, common stock or other forms of capital in 2011.
First Quarter 2011 Conference/Event Schedule
The Company expects to release its first quarter 2011 earnings on April 27, 2011 after the market closes. The Company expects to hold a conference call on April 28, 2011 at 1:00 PM EST to discuss the first quarter 2011 results.

Definitions and Reconciliations
Non-GAAP financial measures and other capitalized terms, as used in this earnings release, are defined and further explained on Attachment 17, Definitions and Reconciliations of non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Terms.  Attachment 17 is included in the full earnings release available at the Companys website at .  This wire distribution includes only definitions and reconciliations of the following non-GAAP financial measures:
http://www.avalonbay.com/earnings
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  FFO is calculated by the Company as Net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  A reconciliation of FFO to Net income attributable to common stockholders is as follows (dollars in thousands):
FFO
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Companys results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010 and the comparable prior year periods include the non-routine items outlined in the following table:
 
 
 
 
 
, as provided within this release in the Companys outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance.  A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the first quarter and full year 2011 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses,
NOI
expensed development and other pursuit costs, net interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, general and administrative expense, joint venture income (loss), depreciation expense, impairment loss on land holdings, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to Net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs.  This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets.  In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to Net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 or classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010).  A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or classified as discontinued operations to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
, as used within this release for certain development communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents managements estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyers valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For development communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first twelve months of stabilized operations following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyers valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents managements estimate of projected gross potential minus projected stabilized economic vacancy and adjusted for stabilized concessions plus projected stabilized other rental revenue. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. Projected gross potential for development communities and dispositions is based on leased rents for occupied homes and managements best estimate of rental levels for homes which are currently unleased, as well as those homes which will become available for lease during the twelve month forward period used to develop Projected NOI. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Companys share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
Projected NOI
 
Management believes that Projected NOI of the development communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the development communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense).  However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis.  Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful.  Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow.  There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies.  In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.
Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis
A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is calculated by the Company as the gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting.  Management generally considers Economic Gain (Loss) to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community.  The Economic Gain (Loss) for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements.  A reconciliation of Economic Gain (Loss) to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for both the full year ended December 31, 2010 as well as prior years activities is presented in the full earnings release.
Economic Gain (Loss)
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains and gain on the sale of investments in real estate joint ventures, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends.  Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies.  EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income attributable to the Company before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage
A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the fourth quarter of 2010 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective development or redevelopment community, or development right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.  For redevelopment communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated.  With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management.  Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.  For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.
Total Capital Cost
 
 
 
 
 
is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $200 - $300 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community.  Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents managements estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items.  For this purpose, managements projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 3.0% -3.5%.  The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property.  Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels.  The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.
Initial Year Market Cap Rate
 
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company.  Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Companys general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses.  Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for Net income as a measure of our performance.  Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Companys acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead.  The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities.  The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the holding period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.
as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by either outstanding secured debt or land leases (excluding land leases with purchase options that were put in place for governmental incentives or tax abatements) as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets.  The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company.  Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity.  A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the full year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized operations as of the beginning of the prior year.  Therefore, for 2010, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have stabilized operations as of January 1, 2009 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.  Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at market rents.  Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents.  By measuring vacant apartments at their market rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue.

This resulted in Earnings per Share  diluted (EPS) of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to EPS of $0.40 for the comparable period of 2009, a decrease of 22.5%. For the year ended December 31, 2010, EPS was $2.07 compared to $1.93 for the year ended December 31, 2009, a per share increase of 7.3%.
The decrease in EPS for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 from the prior year period is due primarily to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, offset partially by the loss on early debt extinguishment recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010.  The increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 is due primarily to charges for early debt extinguishment and impairment of real estate assets recognized in 2009 with no comparable activity in 2010.
 
Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders - diluted (FFO) per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 increased 57.8% to $1.01 from $0.64 for the comparable period of 2009.  FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by 2.8% to $4.00 from $3.89 for 2009. Adjusting for the non-routine items detailed in Attachement 17, FFO per share for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2010 would have increased by 1.0% and decreased by 11.0%, respectively, from the prior year periods.
Commenting on the Companys results, Bryce Blair, Chairman and CEO, said,
Same store NOI growth turned positive in the fourth quarter, capping a year of steady improvement. We expect that accelerating revenue growth combined with investment activity that will deliver and stabilize in 2011 will drive 16% FFO growth for the coming year. Operating fundamentals are expected to further improve, supporting our plan to start another $800 million in 2011 that will fuel future earnings and value growth.

2011 Financial Outlook
The following presents the Company's financial outlook for 2011, the details of which are summarized on Attachments 15 and 16.
In setting operating expectations for 2011, management considers third party macroeconomic forecasts, local market conditions and performance at individual communities. Management expects continued, moderate economic growth in 2011, strengthening throughout the year. Positive annual rental revenue growth in our Established Communities  is expected in all regions, though growth in some West Coast markets may lag other regions.
Projected EPS is expected to be within a range of $3.09 to $3.34 for the full year 2011.
The Company expects 2011 Projected FFO per share to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.75 as compared to $4.00 for the full year 2010, resulting in an expected increase in FFO per share of 15.8% at the mid-point of the range.
For the first quarter of 2011, the Company expects projected EPS within a range of $0.29 to $0.33
. The Company expects Projected FFO per share in the first quarter of 2011 within a range of $1.00 to $1.04.

In the second half of 2011, the Company expects to sell an operating community that is subject to a long-term ground lease, terminating the Companys obligation under the lease upon sale.  If the community is sold as expected, the Company will recognize an increase in its operating results for 2011 of approximately $0.10 per share.  This increase represents the net impact of eliminating the annual lease expense in excess of the cash payments, the loss of NOI from the community subsequent to the disposition and the addition of the disposition proceeds to the Companys available working capital.
The Companys 2011 financial outlook is based on a number of assumptions and estimates, which are provided on Attachment 15 of this release.  The primary assumptions and estimates include the following:
Property Operations
Development
The Company did not impair any assets or abandon any material pursuits during 2010. However, the Companys focus on development of apartment communities and the existing development pipeline present a valuation risk that could result in future abandoned pursuits and/or impairment charges that are not apparent or determinable at this time.
Acquisition & Disposition Activity
Capital Markets
The Company expects to issue between $500,000,000 and $700,000,000 of new unsecured and secured debt, common stock or other forms of capital in 2011.
First Quarter 2011 Conference/Event Schedule
The Company expects to release its first quarter 2011 earnings on April 27, 2011 after the market closes. The Company expects to hold a conference call on April 28, 2011 at 1:00 PM EST to discuss the first quarter 2011 results.

This release, including its attachments, contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms.  The definition and calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures and other terms may differ from the definitions and methodologies used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable.  The non-GAAP financial measures referred to below should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered as an alternative measure of liquidity or as indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
is determined based on a definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).  FFO is calculated by the Company as Net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities, extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and depreciation of real estate assets, including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Management generally considers FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated operating communities and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.  A reconciliation of FFO to Net income attributable to common stockholders is as follows (dollars in thousands):

, as provided within this release in the Companys outlook, is calculated on a basis consistent with historical FFO, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate supplemental measure to projected net income from projected operating performance.  A reconciliation of the range provided for Projected FFO per share (diluted) for the first quarter and full year 2011 to the range provided for projected EPS (diluted) is as follows:
Projected FFO

is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excludes corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed development and other pursuit costs, net interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, general and administrative expense, joint venture income (loss), depreciation expense, impairment loss on land holdings, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. The Company considers NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to Net income of operating performance of a community or communities because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs.  This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets.  In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.
NOI
A reconciliation of NOI (from continuing operations) to Net income, as well as a breakdown of NOI by operating segment, is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
NOI as reported by the Company does not include the operating results from discontinued operations (i.e., assets sold during the period January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 or classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010).  A reconciliation of NOI from communities sold or classified as discontinued operations to net income for these communities is as follows (dollars in thousands):

Projected NOI
, as used within this release for certain Development Communities and in calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate for dispositions, represents managements estimate, as of the date of this release (or as of the date of the buyers valuation in the case of dispositions), of projected stabilized rental revenue minus projected stabilized operating expenses. For Development Communities, Projected NOI is calculated based on the first twelve months of Stabilized Operations, as defined below, following the completion of construction. In calculating the Initial Year Market Cap Rate, Projected NOI for dispositions is calculated for the first twelve months following the date of the buyers valuation. Projected stabilized rental revenue represents managements estimate of projected gross potential minus projected stabilized economic vacancy and adjusted for stabilized concessions plus projected stabilized other rental revenue. Projected stabilized operating expenses do not include interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation or amortization, or any allocation of corporate-level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. Projected gross potential for Development Communities and dispositions is based on leased rents for occupied homes and managements best estimate of rental levels for homes which are currently unleased, as well as those homes which will become available for lease during the twelve month forward period used to develop Projected NOI. The weighted average Projected NOI as a percentage of Total Capital Cost is weighted based on the Companys share of the Total Capital Cost of each community, based on its percentage ownership.
 
Management believes that Projected NOI of the Development Communities, on an aggregated weighted average basis, assists investors in understanding management's estimate of the likely impact on operations of the Development Communities when the assets are complete and achieve stabilized occupancy (before allocation of any corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs or interest expense).  However, in this release the Company has not given a projection of NOI on a company-wide basis.  Given the different dates and fiscal years for which NOI is projected for these communities, the projected allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities under development is complex, impractical to develop, and may not be meaningful.  Projected NOI of these communities is not a projection of the Company's overall financial performance or cash flow.  There can be no assurance that the communities under development or redevelopment will achieve the Projected NOI as described in this release.
is considered by the Company to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies.  In addition, rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) allows an investor to understand the historical trend in cash concessions.
Rental Revenue with Concessions on a Cash Basis
A reconciliation of rental revenue from Established Communities in conformity with GAAP to rental revenue (with concessions on a cash basis) is as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
is calculated by the Company as the gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP, less accumulated depreciation through the date of sale and any other non-cash adjustments that may be required under GAAP accounting.  Management generally considers Economic Gain (Loss) to be an appropriate supplemental measure to gain (loss) on sale in accordance with GAAP because it helps investors to understand the relationship between the cash proceeds from a sale and the cash invested in the sold community.  The Economic Gain (Loss) for each of the communities presented is estimated based on their respective final settlement statements.  A reconciliation of Economic Gain (Loss) to gain on sale in accordance with GAAP for both the full year ended December 31, 2010 as well as prior years activities is presented on Attachment 14.
Economic Gain (Loss)
is calculated by the Company as EBITDA from continuing operations, excluding land gains and gain on the sale of investments in real estate joint ventures, divided by the sum of interest expense, net, and preferred dividends.  Interest Coverage is presented by the Company because it provides rating agencies and investors an additional means of comparing our ability to service debt obligations to that of other companies.  EBITDA is defined by the Company as net income attributable to the Company before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Interest Coverage

A reconciliation of EBITDA and a calculation of Interest Coverage for the fourth quarter of 2010 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 
 
 
includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, or Development Right, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, all as determined in accordance with GAAP.  For Redevelopment Communities, Total Capital Cost excludes costs incurred prior to the start of redevelopment when indicated.  With respect to communities where development or redevelopment was completed in a prior or the current period, Total Capital Cost reflects the actual cost incurred, plus any contingency estimate made by management.  Total Capital Cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.  For joint ventures not in construction, Total Capital Cost is equal to gross real estate cost.
Total Capital Cost
is defined by the Company as Projected NOI of a single community for the first 12 months of operations (assuming no repositioning), less estimates for non-routine allowance of approximately $200 - $300 per apartment home, divided by the gross sales price for the community.  Projected NOI, as referred to above, represents managements estimate of projected rental revenue minus projected operating expenses before interest, income taxes (if any), depreciation, amortization and extraordinary items.  For this purpose, managements projection of operating expenses for the community includes a management fee of 3.0% -3.5%.  The Initial Year Market Cap Rate, which may be determined in a different manner by others, is a measure frequently used in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating the value for a property.  Buyers may assign different Initial Year Market Cap Rates to different communities when determining the appropriate value because they (i) may project different rates of change in operating expenses and capital expenditure estimates and (ii) may project different rates of change in future rental revenue due to different estimates for changes in rent and occupancy levels.  The weighted average Initial Year Market Cap Rate is weighted based on the gross sales price of each community.
Initial Year Market Cap Rate
 
on sold communities refers to the internal rate of return calculated by the Company considering the timing and amounts of (i) total revenue during the period owned by the Company and (ii) the gross sales price net of selling costs, offset by (iii) the undepreciated capital cost of the communities at the time of sale and (iv) total direct operating expenses during the period owned by the Company.  Each of the items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Unleveraged IRR
The calculation of Unleveraged IRR does not include an adjustment for the Companys general and administrative expense, interest expense, or corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses.  Therefore, Unleveraged IRR is not a substitute for Net income as a measure of our performance.  Management believes that the Unleveraged IRR achieved during the period a community is owned by the Company is useful because it is one indication of the gross value created by the Companys acquisition, development or redevelopment, management and sale of a community, before the impact of indirect expenses and Company overhead.  The Unleveraged IRR achieved on the communities as cited in this release should not be viewed as an indication of the gross value created with respect to other communities owned by the Company, and the Company does not represent that it will achieve similar Unleveraged IRRs upon the disposition of other communities.  The weighted average Unleveraged IRR for sold communities is weighted based on all cash flows over the holding period for each respective community, including net sales proceeds.

as calculated by the Company represents NOI generated by real estate assets unencumbered by either outstanding secured debt or land leases (excluding land leases with purchase options that were put in place for governmental incentives or tax abatements) as a percentage of total NOI generated by real estate assets.  The Company believes that current and prospective unsecured creditors of the Company view Unencumbered NOI as one indication of the borrowing capacity of the Company.  Therefore, when reviewed together with the Company's Interest Coverage, EBITDA and cash flow from operations, the Company believes that investors and creditors view Unencumbered NOI as a useful supplemental measure for determining the financial flexibility of an entity.  A calculation of Unencumbered NOI for the full year ended December 31, 2010 is as follows (dollars in thousands):
Unencumbered NOI
 
 
 
 
 
are identified by the Company as communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had Stabilized Operations, as defined below, as of the beginning of the prior year.  Therefore, for 2010, Established Communities are consolidated communities that have Stabilized Operations as of January 1, 2009 and are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.  Established Communities do not include communities that are currently held for sale or planned for disposition during the current year.
Established Communities
are completed consolidated communities that the Company owns, which did not have stabilized operations as of January 1, 2009, but have stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2010. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities or that are planned for disposition within the current year.
Other Stabilized Communities
are communities that are under construction during the current year. These communities may be partially or fully complete and operating.
Development Communities
are communities where the Company owns a majority interest and where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year.  Redevelopment is generally considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed either $5,000,000 or 10% of the communitys pre-development basis and is expected to have a material impact on the communitys operations, including occupancy levels and future rental rates.
Redevelopment Communities
 
are calculated by the Company as rental revenue in accordance with GAAP, divided by the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes.
Average Rental Rates
is defined as total possible revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of total possible revenue. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing occupied units at contract rates and vacant units at Market Rents.  Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents.  By measuring vacant apartments at their Market Rents, Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a communitys gross revenue.
Economic Occupancy
as reported by the Company are based on the current market rates set by the managers of the Companys communities based on their experience in renting their communities apartments and publicly available market data.  Trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary.  Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

Stabilized/Restabilized Operations
 
as calculated for certain Development and Redevelopment Communities in lease-up, reflects managements projected stabilized rents net of estimated stabilized concessions and including estimated stabilized other rental revenue. Projected stabilized rents are based on one or more of the following: (i) actual average leased rents on apartments leased through quarter end; (ii) projected rollover rents on apartments leased through quarter end where the lease term expires within the first twelve months of Stabilized Operations, and Market rents on unleased homes.
Average Rent per Home
 
are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which the Company either has an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which the Company is the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land or where the Company controls the land through a ground lease or owns land to develop a new community.  The Company capitalizes related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which future development is probable.
