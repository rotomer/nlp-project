Item 5.02
      
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
 
The Company previously announced that (i) Bryce Blair, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, had chosen to retire from the role of CEO at the end of 2011, (ii) effective on January 1, 2012, Timothy J. Naughton, the Company's current President and a director, would assume the additional title and role of Chief Executive Officer, and (iii) effective January 1, 2012, Mr. Blair would remain as Chairman of the Board and would devote at least half his work time that year to AvalonBay matters.  The Company also previously announced that, after review, the Board had determined to phase out over a period of time individual employment agreements with the four executives who had employment agreements, namely Messrs. Blair and Naughton as well as Thomas J. Sargeant, Chief Financial Officer, and Leo S. Horey, Executive Vice President- Operations.  Consistent with that decision, Mr. Blair's employment agreement in his role as Chief Executive Officer will expire on January 1, 2012 and will not be replaced with a new employment agreement.  Also consistent with that decision, on December 16, 2011, the Company and Messrs. Naughton, Sargeant and Horey entered into new employment agreements (the "Substitute Employment Agreements") to replace those executives' prior employment agreements (the "Prior Agreements").
 
The terms of the Substitute Employment Agreements for Messrs. Naughton, Sargeant and Horey are described below.
 
1.  .  The Substitute Employment Agreements will expire on December 31, 2015.  By contrast, the Prior Agreements had an evergreen feature by which the agreements would automatically renew for successive years unless the Company gave notice of a non-renewal, which would trigger the executive's right to terminate his employment and receive severance.   For example, under Mr. Sargeant's Prior Agreement, if the Company chose to not renew the agreement, Mr. Sargeant could terminate his employment and receive cash equal to one times the value of his base salary, annual bonus, and annual long term incentive awards, as well as accelerated vesting of long term incentive awards.
Term
 
The Board considered it significant that the executives relinquished their right to an evergreen employment agreement with a right of severance for a non-renewal.
 
2.  .   Under the Substitute Employment Agreements, if the Company terminates the executive's employment without cause, the executive will be entitled to a multiple of Covered Compensation, which is defined as annual base salary and annual cash bonus.  In the case of Messrs. Naughton and Sargeant, the multiple is two times unless the termination is in connection with a sale of the Company, in which case the multiple is three times.  In Mr. Horey's case, the multiple is one times unless the termination is in connection with a sale of the Company, in which case the multiple is two times.
Severance
 
The Board considered it significant that the executives relinquished their right under the Prior Agreements to a greater multiple of Covered Compensation, to a more expansive definition of covered compensation (which included the value of annual long term incentive awards), and to the right to simply resign following a sale of the company and receive severance (single trigger).
 
Under the Substitute Employment Agreements, as with the Prior Agreements, in connection with a termination without cause the executives will also receive a cash payment representing the pro rata value of their annual bonus and long term incentive award for the portion of the year worked, and the executives' unvested long term incentive awards (restricted stock and options) will vest.
 
The Substitute Employment Agreements provide that it would be considered a termination without cause:  (a) of Mr. Naughton, if his title is reduced to below that of Chief Executive Officer after January 1, 2012 or if he does not report directly to the full Board, (b) of Mr. Sargeant, if his title is not that of Chief Financial Officer or he is not the most senior financial officer, and (c) of Mr. Horey, if
 
his title is reduced to below that of Executive Vice President or he is not a member of the executive officer group.
 
3.  .   Unlike the Prior Agreements, the Substitute Employment Agreements provide no severance in the event of termination of employment due to (a) death, (b) disability or (c) departure following a decision by the Company not to renew the agreement at the end of its term.
No Severance in Connection with Death, Disability or Non-Renewal
 
4.  .  Unlike the Prior Agreements, there will be no tax gross up if an excise tax is imposed on severance payments under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "golden parachute tax").  If the executives would be better off with reduced severance in order to avoid the effect of the golden parachute tax, then their severance will be reduced accordingly.
No Tax Gross Up
 
5.  .  In consideration of relinquishing the protections and benefits of the Prior Agreements, and in consideration of helping with a smooth organization transition related to the CEO transition to occur on January 1, 2012, Messrs. Sargeant and Horey (but not Mr. Naughton) will receive a one time award of restricted stock on December 30, 2011.  In the case of Mr. Sargeant, the number of shares awarded shall be equal to $1 million divided by the closing price of the Company's stock on that date (the "Closing Price").  In the case of Mr. Horey, the number of shares awarded shall be equal to $300,000 divided by the Closing Price.  Of the shares awarded, 75% will vest on December 31, 2013, and 25% will vest on December 31, 2014.  The restricted stock award will generally have the terms and conditions in the Company's annual restricted stock agreement, including accelerated vesting upon death, disability, sale of the Company, or retirement (as defined in the agreement), except that there shall be no automatic vesting for a retirement that occurs prior to December 31, 2013.
One Time Supplemental Award
 
6.  .  Provisions in the Prior Agreement that provided certain perquisites, such as an annual allowance of $5,000, have not been carried over to the Substitute Employment Agreements.  As with the Prior Agreements, the Substitute Employment Agreements provide that it would be a default under the agreements if the Company takes bad faith actions  with respect to an executive's annual compensation and bonus awards, which bad faith must be demonstrated by reference to the awards set for and awarded other officers.  The executive must provide the Company notice of such an alleged default and an opportunity to cure.  In the event of such a  default that is not cured, the executive would be entitled to terminate employment and receive the same level of severance as in a termination without cause.
Other Compensation Provisions
 
Attached as exhibits are the Substitute Employment Agreements of Messrs. Naughton, Sargeant and Horey, which include the form of the one time supplemental restricted stock award for Messrs. Sargeant and Horey.

Exhibit 10.1
 
Timothy J. Naughton
[address]
 
Dear Tim:
 
As you know, the Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company") have concluded that employment agreements, as a general matter of policy, may no longer be in the best interests of the Company except under special circumstances and only then narrowly tailored to fit the situation.  Therefore, the Company and you have negotiated to terminate your existing Employment Agreement dated February 26, 2001, as the same has been amended to date (the "Current Employment Agreement"), on the following terms and conditions:
 
1.  Defined terms used in this letter and not defined elsewhere in this letter have the meanings ascribed thereto on attached hereto.
Exhibit A
 
2.   You and the Company agree that, as of the Effective Date, your Current Employment Agreement will be of no further force and effect and will be terminated in full.  In consideration of your agreeing to terminate the Current Employment Agreement and your rights and benefits thereunder, the Company has agreed to provide you with the benefits described in paragraph 3 below.
 
3.  In the event the Company or any successor to the Company terminates your employment without Cause, then:
 
A.  The Company shall pay to you as severance following your termination the following (subject to tax withholding):
 
(a)
         
An amount of cash determined as follows:  your annual cash bonus at target plus the dollar value of your annual long term incentive award at target, for the year of termination, pro rated to reflect the portion of the year worked through the date of termination.  For example, if the termination occurs on June 30, 20XX, and your annual cash bonus at target for 20XX is $X and the dollar value of your long term incentive award at target for 20XX is $Y, then the amount due under this clause (a) would be 50% of ($X plus $Y).
 
plus
 
(b)
        
An amount of cash equal to two (2) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination, provided that if such termination occurs within a two-year period after a Sale Event, then the amount of cash under this clause (b) shall equal three (3) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination.  (We further agree that if your employment is terminated by us without Cause either (i) after the Company has entered into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a transaction that if consummated would result in a Sale Event or (ii) at a time when we actively anticipate or are
 
 
planning to enter into such an agreement, and thereafter in either case a Sale Event occurs within six months after your employment terminates, you will receive an additional cash payment of one (1) times your Covered Compensation (so that the total amount received by you, after receipt of such additional cash payment, shall equal three (3) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination).)
 
B.  In addition, your unvested employee stock options and restricted stock grants would vest on the date of termination and you would have one year to exercise your employee stock options (subject to the earlier expiration of the 10 year term of such options).
 
C.  You would also be provided with other customary benefits, if any, that are generally provided by the Company for officers who are terminated without cause, such as payment of COBRA premiums for a period of time.
 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in the event that the amounts you would receive pursuant to this agreement for a termination without Cause, together with any other amounts you would receive in connection with such termination of employment, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revnue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), then the limitation provisions relating to Section 4999 of the Code contained in Section 6 of the Company's Officer Severance Plan (as such plan is in effect on the date hereof, or a successor provision in an amended or successor Officer Severance Plan if such successor provision when applied is more beneficial to you) will apply as if stated in full herein and may limit the the cash payments and benefits you receive upon such termination.
 
We agree that if (i) we do any of the following (each, a "Default"),  and (ii) within thirty days of a Default or alleged Default you provide us of notice of your intent to terminate your employment by reason of such Default with reasonable specificity as to the actions taken by us which constitute a Default, and (iii) we do not cure such Default within ten days of our receipt of your notice relating thereto, then in such event you may terminate your employment and such termination shall constitute a termination without Cause such that you are entitled to the benefits described above:  (a) we reduce your title after January 1, 2012 to below that of Chief Executive Officer,  or (b) your are not the most senior executive officer directing the day-to-day activities of the Company, or (c) you do not report directly to the full Board of Directors, or (d)  we violate our agreement in Section 4 of this letter agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will only be entitled to the payments above upon execution by you, within 30 days following your termination and upon the lapse of the seven-day revocation period (or such other revocation period as we are required to legally provide you), of a Separation and Release Agreement containing reasonable general release, confidentiality, return of property, one year employee non-solicitation, and mutual non-disparagement provisions, with provisions addressing these and related matters to be in a form substantially similar to those set forth in .  Subject to the foregoing,  and the delay that may be required pursuant to the provisions set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto, payments will be made as soon as reasonably practicable (as determined by the Company) after your execution of such Separation and Release Agreement and the lapse of any required revocation period but in all events such payments must be made (unless you do not timely execute a Separation and Release Agreement through no fault of the Company's) on or before the 60
Exhibit B
th
 day after your involuntary termination of employment, except that (i) if such 60-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, such payment in all events will occur during the second calendar year and within such 60-day period, and (ii) such payment may be further delayed in accordance with the provisions set forth in .
Exhibit C
 
4.  The Company acknowledges that your base salary, cash bonus and long term incentive bonus are each a material part of your total compensation.   The Company will endeavor to provide you with a reasonable bonus program which continues to provide for a reasonable cash bonus and/or reasonable long term incentive bonus to compensate you for the achievement by the Company and/or you of reasonable goals and objectives such that your total compensation (consisting of base salary, cash bonus and long term incentive bonus), in light of the Company's performance and your performance and service as Chief Executive Officer, is reasonable under the circumstances and reasonable relative to the cash bonuses and long term incentive bonuses awarded other officers of the Company as compared to their target bonuses.  The Company shall not be in breach of this provision unless it can be demonstrated that the Company acted in bad faith in determining whether to award (or the size of an award of) a cash bonus or long term incentive bonus, which determination of bad faith shall specifically be made with reference to the target awards set for other officers and the actual awards paid other officers.
 
6.  This agreement shall remain in effect until December 31, 2015, and may be renewed thereafter upon mutual agreement of the parties.  While this agreement is in effect, you would not receive cash severance under the Company's Officer Severance Plan in addition to the cash severance provided hereunder (except to the extent that you would have been entitled to a greater benefit under the Officer Severance Plan).
 
7.  This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Virginia.
 
8.  Your employment remains "at will" and may be terminated at any time, with or without Cause, at the option of the Company, subject only to the severance obligations provided herein and as otherwise provided by law.
 
9.  Reference is made to the Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Company Agreement between you and the Company originally entered into on January 28, 2003 and most recently amended and restated on December 14, 2008 (as so amended and restated, the "Split Dollar Agreement").  In the Split Dollar Agreement, "Employment Agreement" is defined as your Current Employment Agreement, but you agree, by your execution of this agreement, that, regardless of whether this agreement is in effect or has expired, (i) such reference in the Split Dollar Agreement shall hereafter be understood to refer to this Agreement, and (ii) the reference in the Split Dollar Agreement to a Constructive Termination Without Cause, which is a term that is not used in this Agreement, shall hereafter be understood to refer to your decision to terminate your employment because of an uncured Default as provided in Section 3 of this Agreement.
 
 
Exhibit A
 
"Effective Date" means the latest date on which letter agreements terminating the current employment agreements of you, Thomas J. Sargeant and Leo Horey are fully signed by all of the Company, you and Messrs. Sargeant and Horey.
 
"Cause" means a vote of the Board of Directors of the Company resolving that you should be dismissed as a result of (i) any material breach by you of any agreement to which the you and the Company are parties, (ii) any act (other than retirement) or omission to act by you which may have a material and adverse effect on the business of the Company or on your ability to perform services for the Company, including, without limitation, the commission of any crime (other than ordinary traffic violations), or (iii) any material misconduct or neglect of duties by you in connection with the business or affairs of the Company.
 
"Covered Compensation" means the sum of (i) your base salary on the date of termination plus (ii) the average of your last two annual cash bonuses as of the date of termination.

Exhibit B
 
Offset for Withholding Tax
.  You acknowledge that income taxes or other legally mandated withholding will be due upon the transfer or vesting of stock or the exercise of stock options and the Company will not be obligated to deliver to you any share certificates until you have satisfied all withholding tax obligations.  You agree and authorize the Company to withhold cash payments otherwise due to you under this Separation and Release Agreement, and to use such withheld payments for the purpose of satisfying any obligations which you may have for taxes or other legally mandated withholding until such obligations are fully satisfied.  In the event that the payments withheld are insufficient to satisfy such obligations, you agree to make any additional payments necessary directly to the Company until all such obligations are satisfied.  The Company will allow you, should you elect, to have shares withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligation that accrues upon the vesting of the shares.
 
Release of Claims
.  In consideration of all payments described in this Separation and Release Agreement, you hereby covenant and agree as follows:

Litigation Cooperation

You agree to continue to serve the Company as a litigation consultant and, in connection therewith, to cooperate reasonably with the Company in (i) the defense or prosecution of any claims or actions which already have been brought or which may be brought in the future against or on behalf of the Company and (ii) responding to, cooperating with, or contesting any governmental audit, inspection, inquiry, proceeding or investigation, which relate to events or occurrences that transpired during your employment with the Company.

The Company will try, in good faith, to exercise its rights under this Section so as not to unreasonably interfere with your personal schedule or ability to engage in gainful employment.  In the event other commitments preclude you from being available to the Company
provided
 
when requested, you may decline a Company request for cooperation so long as you promptly provide to the Company reasonable alternative dates when you will be available to provide such cooperation.  The Company agrees to reimburse you for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that you incur in connection with such cooperation, subject to reasonable documentation.

Exhibit C
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive's separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive's separation from service would be considered deferred compensation subject to the 20 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one day after the Executive's separation from service, or (B) the Executive's death.  If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule.
 
(b)           To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes "non-qualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive's termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Executive's "separation from service."  The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 1(h).
 
(c)           The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code.  The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.
 
(d)           The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.

Exhibit 10.2
 
Thomas J. Sargeant
[address]
 
Dear Tom:
 
As you know, the Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company") have concluded that employment agreements, as a general matter of policy, may no longer be in the best interests of the Company except under special circumstances and only then narrowly tailored to fit the situation.  Therefore, the Company and you have negotiated to terminate your existing Employment Agreement dated July 1, 2003, as the same has been amended to date (the "Current Employment Agreement"), on the following terms and conditions:
 
1.  Defined terms used in this letter and not defined elsewhere in this letter have the meanings ascribed thereto on attached hereto.
Exhibit A
 
2.   You and the Company agree that, as of the Effective Date, your Current Employment Agreement will be of no further force and effect and will be terminated in full.  In consideration of your agreeing to terminate the Current Employment Agreement and your rights and benefits thereunder, and for your help with a smooth organizational transition related to the recently announced CEO transition, the Company has agreed to provide you with the benefits described in paragraphs 3 and 4 below.
 
3.  In the event the Company or any successor to the Company terminates your employment without Cause, then:
 
A.  The Company shall pay to you as severance following your termination the following (subject to tax withholding):
 
(a)
         
An amount of cash determined as follows:  your annual cash bonus at target plus the dollar value of your annual long term incentive award at target, for the year of termination, pro rated to reflect the portion of the year worked through the date of termination.  For example, if the termination occurs on June 30, 20XX, and your annual cash bonus at target for 20XX is $X and the dollar value of your long term incentive award at target for 20XX is $Y, then the amount due under this clause (a) would be 50% of ($X plus $Y).
 
plus
 
(b)
        
An amount of cash equal to two (2) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination, provided that if such termination occurs within a two-year period after a Sale Event, then the amount of cash under this clause (b) shall equal three (3) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination.  (We further agree that if your employment is terminated by us without Cause either (i) after the Company has entered into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a transaction that if consummated
 
 
would result in a Sale Event or (ii) at a time when we actively anticipate or are planning to enter into such an agreement, and thereafter in either case a Sale Event occurs within six months after your employment terminates, you will receive an additional cash payment of one (1) times your Covered Compensation (so that the total amount received by you, after receipt of such additional cash payment, shall equal three (3) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination).)
 
B.  In addition, your unvested employee stock options and restricted stock grants would vest on the date of termination and you would have one year to exercise your employee stock options (subject to the earlier expiration of the 10 year term of such options).
 
C.  You would also be provided with other customary benefits, if any, that are generally provided by the Company for officers who are terminated without cause, such as payment of COBRA premiums for a period of time.
 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in the event that the amounts you would receive pursuant to this agreement for a termination without Cause, together with any other amounts you would receive in connection with such termination of employment, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revnue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), then the limitation provisions relating to Section 4999 of the Code contained in Section 6 of the Company's Officer Severance Plan (as such plan is in effect on the date hereof, or a successor provision in an amended or successor Officer Severance Plan if such successor provision when applied is more beneficial to you) will apply as if stated in full herein and may limit the the cash payments and benefits you receive upon such termination.
 
We agree that if (i) we do any of the following (each, a "Default"),  and (ii) within thirty days of a Default or alleged Default you provide us of notice of your intent to terminate your employment by reason of such Default with reasonable specificity as to the actions taken by us which constitute a Default, and (iii) we do not cure such Default within ten days of our receipt of your notice relating thereto, then in such event you may terminate your employment and such termination shall constitute a termination without Cause such that you are entitled to the benefits described above:  (a) we change your title so that you are not the Chief Financial Officer,  or (b) we change your role so that you are not the most senior financial officer, or (c) we violate our agreement in Section 5 of this letter agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will only be entitled to the payments above upon execution by you, within 30 days following your termination and upon the lapse of the seven-day revocation period (or such other revocation period as we are required to legally provide you), of a Separation and Release Agreement containing reasonable general release, confidentiality, return of property, one year employee non-solicitation, and mutual non-disparagement provisions, with provisions addressing these and related matters to be in a form substantially similar to those set forth in .  Subject to the foregoing,  and the delay that may be required pursuant to the provisions set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto, payments will be made as soon as reasonably practicable (as determined by the Company) after your execution of such Separation and Release Agreement and the lapse of any required revocation period but in all events such payments must be made (unless you do not timely execute a Separation and Release Agreement through no fault of the Company's) on or before the 60
Exhibit B
th
 day after your involuntary termination of employment, except that (i) if such 60-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, such payment in all events will occur during the second calendar year and within such 60-day period, and (ii) such payment may be further delayed in accordance with the provisions set forth in .
Exhibit C
 
4.  The Company shall also award you, effective as of December 30, 2011, a restricted stock award under the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, subject to the following:
 
A.
          
The number of shares awarded shall be determined by dividing one million dollars ($1,000,000) by the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of the Company's Common Stock on December 30, 2011, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.
 
B.
            
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares so granted shall cliff vest in full on December 31, 2013 if you remain employed through such date, with no interim or partial vesting before such date except that the vesting of such shares may accelerate if your employment is terminated without Cause or by reason of death or disability or if there is a Sale Event (for clarification, it is noted that the vesting of such shares shall not occur in the event your employment terminates by reason of Retirement (as defined in the Company's current standard award agreements) prior to December 31, 2013).  The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of such shares shall vest on December 31, 2014, subject to earlier acceleration of vesting in the event of a termination of employment due to death, disability, termination without Cause or Retirement, or upon a Sale Event.   The Form of such restricted stock agreement is attached as hereto.
Exhibit D
 
5.  The Company acknowledges that your base salary, cash bonus and long term incentive bonus are each a material part of your total compensation.   The Company will endeavor to provide you with a reasonable bonus program which continues to provide for a reasonable cash bonus and/or reasonable long term incentive bonus to compensate you for the achievement by the Company and/or you of reasonable goals and objectives such that your total compensation (consisting of base salary, cash bonus and long term incentive bonus), in light of the Company's performance and your performance and service as Chief Financial Officer, is reasonable under the circumstances and reasonable relative to the cash bonuses and long term incentive bonuses awarded other officers of the Company as compared to their target bonuses.  The Company shall not be in breach of this provision unless it can be demonstrated that the Company acted in bad faith in determining whether to award (or the size of an award of) a cash bonus or long term incentive bonus, which determination of bad faith shall specifically be made with reference to the target awards set for other officers and the actual awards paid other officers.
 
6.  This agreement shall remain in effect until December 31, 2015, and may be renewed thereafter upon mutual agreement of the parties.  While this agreement is in effect, you would not receive cash severance under the Company's Officer Severance Plan in addition to the cash severance provided hereunder (except to the extent that you would have been entitled to a greater benefit under the Officer Severance Plan).
 
7.  This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Virginia.
 
8.  Your employment remains "at will" and may be terminated at any time, with or without Cause, at the option of the Company, subject only to the severance obligations provided herein and as otherwise provided by law.
 
9.  Reference is made to the Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Company Agreement between you and the Company originally entered into in January 2003 and most recently amended and restated on December 14, 2008 (as so amended and restated, the "Split Dollar Agreement").  In the Split Dollar Agreement, "Employment Agreement" is defined as your Current Employment Agreement, but you
 
agree, by your execution of this agreement, that, regardless of whether this agreement is in effect or has expired, (i) such reference in the Split Dollar Agreement shall hereafter be understood to refer to this Agreement, and (ii) the reference in the Split Dollar Agreement to a Constructive Termination Without Cause, which is a term that is not used in this Agreement, shall hereafter be understood to refer to your decision to terminate your employment because of an uncured Default as provided in Section 3 of this Agreement.
 
Exhibit A
 
"Effective Date" means the latest date on which letter agreements terminating the current employment agreements of you, Timothy Naughton and Leo Horey are fully signed by all of the Company, you and Messrs. Naughton and Horey.
 
"Cause" means a vote of the Board of Directors of the Company resolving that you should be dismissed as a result of (i) any material breach by you of any agreement to which the you and the Company are parties, (ii) any act (other than retirement) or omission to act by you which may have a material and adverse effect on the business of the Company or on your ability to perform services for the Company, including, without limitation, the commission of any crime (other than ordinary traffic violations), or (iii) any material misconduct or neglect of duties by you in connection with the business or affairs of the Company.
 
"Covered Compensation" means the sum of (i) your base salary on the date of termination plus (ii) the average of your last two annual cash bonuses as of the date of termination.

Sale Event" shall have the meaning given thereto in the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
 
Exhibit B
 
Offset for Withholding Tax
.  You acknowledge that income taxes or other legally mandated withholding will be due upon the transfer or vesting of stock or the exercise of stock options and the Company will not be obligated to deliver to you any share certificates until you have satisfied all withholding tax obligations.  You agree and authorize the Company to withhold cash payments otherwise due to you under this Separation and Release Agreement, and to use such withheld payments for the purpose of satisfying any obligations which you may have for taxes or other legally mandated withholding until such obligations are fully satisfied.  In the event that the payments withheld are insufficient to satisfy such obligations, you agree to make any additional payments necessary directly to the Company until all such obligations are satisfied.  The Company will allow you, should you elect, to have shares withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligation that accrues upon the vesting of the shares.
 
Release of Claims
.  In consideration of all payments described in this Separation and Release Agreement, you hereby covenant and agree as follows:
 
(a)           You, on behalf of yourself and your successors, heirs, assigns, executors, administrators and/or estate, hereby knowingly and voluntarily, irrevocably and unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge the Company, its subsidiaries, divisions and related or affiliated entities, and each of their respective predecessors, successors or assigns, and the current and former officers, directors, partners, shareholders, representatives, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (the ""), from any and all charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs actually incurred), known or unknown, that directly or indirectly arise out of, relate to or concern your employment or termination of employment with the Company (""), which you have, own or hold, or at any time heretofore had, owned or held against the Releasees up to the date on which you execute this Separation and Release Agreement, including without limitation, express or implied, all Claims for:  breach of express or implied contract; promissory estoppel; fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; intentional, reckless or negligent infliction of emotional distress; breach of any express or implied covenant of employment, including the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; interference with contractual or advantageous relations; or any alleged violation of:

Exhibit C
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive's separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive's separation from service would be considered deferred compensation subject to the 20 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one day after the Executive's separation from service, or (B) the Executive's death.

The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 1(h).
 
(c)           The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.

The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.
 
(d)           The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.

Exhibit 10.3
 
Leo S. Horey
[address]
 
Dear Leo:
 
As you know, the Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the "Company") have concluded that employment agreements, as a general matter of policy, may no longer be in the best interests of the Company except under special circumstances and only then narrowly tailored to fit the situation.  Therefore, the Company and you have negotiated to terminate your existing Employment Agreement dated September 10, 2001, as the same has been amended to date (the "Current Employment Agreement"), on the following terms and conditions:
 
1.  Defined terms used in this letter and not defined elsewhere in this letter have the meanings ascribed thereto on attached hereto.
Exhibit A
 
2.   You and the Company agree that, as of the Effective Date, your Current Employment Agreement will be of no further force and effect and will be terminated in full.  In consideration of your agreeing to terminate the Current Employment Agreement and your rights and benefits thereunder, and for your help with a smooth organizational transition related to the recently announced CEO transition, the Company has agreed to provide you with the benefits described in paragraphs 3 and 4 below.
 
3.  In the event the Company or any successor to the Company terminates your employment without Cause, then:
 
A.  The Company shall pay to you as severance following your termination the following (subject to tax withholding):
 
(a)
         
An amount of cash determined as follows:  your annual cash bonus at target plus the dollar value of your annual long term incentive award at target, for the year of termination, pro rated to reflect the portion of the year worked through the date of termination.  For example, if the termination occurs on June 30, 20XX, and your annual cash bonus at target for 20XX is $X and the dollar value of your long term incentive award at target for 20XX is $Y, then the amount due under this clause (a) would be 50% of ($X plus $Y).
 
plus
 
(b)
        
An amount of cash equal to one (1) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination, provided that if such termination occurs within a two-year period after a Sale Event, then the amount of cash under this clause (b) shall equal two (2) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination.  (We further agree that if your employment is terminated by us without Cause either (i) after the Company has entered into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to a transaction that if consummated
 
 
would result in a Sale Event or (ii) at a time when we actively anticipate or are planning to enter into such an agreement, and thereafter in either case a Sale Event occurs within six months after your employment terminates, you will receive an additional cash payment of one (1) times your Covered Compensation (so that the total amount received by you, after receipt of such additional cash payment, shall equal two (2) times your Covered Compensation as in effect on the date of termination).)
 
B.  In addition, your unvested employee stock options and restricted stock grants would vest on the date of termination and you would have one year to exercise your employee stock options (subject to the earlier expiration of the 10 year term of such options).
 
C.  You would also be provided with other customary benefits, if any, that are generally provided by the Company for officers who are terminated without cause, such as payment of COBRA premiums for a period of time.
 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, in the event that the amounts you would receive pursuant to this agreement for a termination without Cause, together with any other amounts you would receive in connection with such termination of employment, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revnue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), then the limitation provisions relating to Section 4999 of the Code contained in Section 6 of the Company's Officer Severance Plan (as such plan is in effect on the date hereof, or a successor provision in an amended or successor Officer Severance Plan if such successor provision when applied is more beneficial to you) will apply as if stated in full herein and may limit the the cash payments and benefits you receive upon such termination.
 
We agree that if (i) we do any of the following (each, a "Default"),  and (ii) within thirty days of a Default or alleged Default you provide us of notice of your intent to terminate your employment by reason of such Default with reasonable specificity as to the actions taken by us which constitute a Default, and (iii) we do not cure such Default within ten days of our receipt of your notice relating thereto, then in such event you may terminate your employment and such termination shall constitute a termination without Cause such that you are entitled to the benefits described above:  (a) we reduce your title to below that of an Executive Vice President,  or (b) you are no longer included in the executive officer group or a participant at executive officer meetings, or (c) we violate our agreement in Section 5 of this letter agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will only be entitled to the payments above upon execution by you, within 30 days following your termination and upon the lapse of the seven-day revocation period (or such other revocation period as we are required to legally provide you), of a Separation and Release Agreement containing reasonable general release, confidentiality, return of property, one year employee non-solicitation, and mutual non-disparagement provisions, with provisions addressing these and related matters to be in a form substantially similar to those set forth in .  Subject to the foregoing,  and the delay that may be required pursuant to the provisions set forth in Exhibit C attached hereto, payments will be made as soon as reasonably practicable (as determined by the Company) after your execution of such Separation and Release Agreement and the lapse of any required revocation period but in all events such payments must be made (unless you do not timely execute a Separation and Release Agreement through no fault of the Company's) on or before the 60
Exhibit B
th
 day after your involuntary termination of employment, except that (i) if such 60-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, such payment in all events will occur during the second calendar year and within such 60-day period, and (ii) such payment may be further delayed in accordance with the provisions set forth in .
Exhibit C
 
4.  The Company shall also award you, effective as of December 30, 2011, a restricted stock award under the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, subject to the following:
 
A.
          
The number of shares awarded shall be determined by dividing three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) by the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of a share of the Company's Common Stock on December 30, 2011, rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.
 
B.
            
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the shares so granted shall cliff vest in full on December 31, 2013 if you remain employed through such date, with no interim or partial vesting before such date except that the vesting of such shares may accelerate if your employment is terminated without Cause or by reason of death or disability or if there is a Sale Event (for clarification, it is noted that the vesting of such shares shall not occur in the event your employment terminates by reason of Retirement (as defined in the Company's current standard award agreements) prior to December 31, 2013).  The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of such shares shall vest on December 31, 2014, subject to earlier acceleration of vesting in the event of a termination of employment due to death, disability, termination without Cause or Retirement, or upon a Sale Event.  The Form of such restricted stock agreement is attached as hereto.
Exhibit D
 
5.  The Company acknowledges that your base salary, cash bonus and long term incentive bonus are each a material part of your total compensation.   The Company will endeavor to provide you with a reasonable bonus program which continues to provide for a reasonable cash bonus and/or reasonable long term incentive bonus to compensate you for the achievement by the Company and/or you of reasonable goals and objectives such that your total compensation (consisting of base salary, cash bonus and long term incentive bonus), in light of the Company's performance and your performance and service as Executive Vice President, is reasonable under the circumstances and reasonable relative to the cash bonuses and long term incentive bonuses awarded other officers of the Company as compared to their target bonuses.  The Company shall not be in breach of this provision unless it can be demonstrated that the Company acted in bad faith in determining whether to award (or the size of an award of) a cash bonus or long term incentive bonus, which determination of bad faith shall specifically be made with reference to the target awards set for other officers and the actual awards paid other officers.
 
6.  This agreement shall remain in effect until December 31, 2015, and may be renewed thereafter upon mutual agreement of the parties.  While this agreement is in effect, you would not receive cash severance under the Company's Officer Severance Plan in addition to the cash severance provided hereunder (except to the extent that you would have been entitled to a greater benefit under the Officer Severance Plan).
 
7.  This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Virginia.
 
8.  Your employment remains "at will" and may be terminated at any time, with or without Cause, at the option of the Company, subject only to the severance obligations provided herein and as otherwise provided by law.
 
9.  Reference is made to the Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Company Agreement between you and the Company originally entered into on February 19, 2003 and most recently amended and restated on December 14, 2008 (as so amended and restated, the "Split Dollar Agreement").  In the Split Dollar Agreement, "Employment Agreement" is defined as your Current Employment
 
Agreement, but you agree, by your execution of this agreement, that, regardless of whether this agreement is in effect or has expired, (i) such reference in the Split Dollar Agreement shall hereafter be understood to refer to this Agreement, and (ii) the reference in the Split Dollar Agreement to a Constructive Termination Without Cause, which is a term that is not used in this Agreement, shall hereafter be understood to refer to your decision to terminate your employment because of an uncured Default as provided in Section 3 of this Agreement.

In the event that the payments withheld are insufficient to satisfy such obligations, you agree to make any additional payments necessary directly to the Company until all such obligations are satisfied.

Exhibit C
 
(a)           Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive's separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive's separation from service would be considered deferred compensation subject to the 20 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one day after the Executive's separation from service, or (B) the Executive's death.  If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule.
 
(b)           To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes "non-qualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive's termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Executive's "separation from service."  The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A 1(h).
 
(c)           The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code.  The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party.
 
(d)           The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section.
