At the meeting, holders of the Company's stock were asked (1) to elect nine directors to serve until the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified, (2) to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012, (3) to cast a non-binding, advisory vote upon the compensation of executive officers of the Company, as described in the Company's proxy statement, and (4) to consider and vote upon a stockholder proposal concerning the preparation of a sustainability report.
 
Each share of common stock was entitled to one vote with respect to matters submitted to a vote of the Company's stockholders, and the voting results reported below are final.

Each of the Company's nominees for director as listed in the proxy statement was re-elected as shown in the table below.  There were no votes abstained with respect to any director nominee.  There were 3,016,043 broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 1.

There were no broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 2.

sustainability.  He stated that the Company is proud of what it currently does in this area and will explore how it can provide additional information on its ongoing efforts in this area in a cost effective manner.
