Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), confirms its agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and UBS Securities LLC (each, an "Agent" and collectively, the "Agents"), with respect to the issue and sale from time to time by the Company of its Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue (the "Notes"), as follows:
 
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to those terms in the Prospectus (as defined herein).
 
1.
                                     
Description of Notes
.  The Company proposes to issue the Notes under that certain Indenture, dated as of January 16, 1998 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by that certain First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 20, 1998, that certain Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 7, 1998, that certain Amended and Restated Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 10, 2000, and that certain Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated September 18, 2006 (collectively and together with the Original Indenture and any additional indentures supplemental thereto entered into after the date hereof, the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to State Street Bank and Trust Company and US Bank, National Association), as trustee (the "Trustee").
 
This agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") provides both for the sale of Notes by the Company to one or more Agents as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers and for the sale of Notes by the Company directly to investors (as may from time to time be agreed to by the Company and the applicable Agent), in which case the applicable Agent will act as an agent of the Company in soliciting offers for the purchase of Notes.
The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179720) for the registration of debt securities, including the Notes, preferred stock and common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the offering thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 430A or Rule 415 of the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Securities Act Rules and Regulations").  Such registration statement has become effective.  Such registration statement (and any further registration statements which may be filed by the Company for the purpose of registering additional securities including the Notes and in connection with which this Distribution Agreement is included or incorporated by reference as an exhibit) and the prospectus constituting a part thereof (including in each case the information, if any, deemed to be part thereof pursuant to Rule 430A or 430B of the Securities Act Rules and Regulations), and any prospectus supplement and pricing supplement relating to the Notes, including all documents incorporated therein by reference, as from time to time amended or supplemented by the filing of documents pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or the Securities Act or otherwise, is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement."  A prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") setting forth the terms of the offer of the Notes contemplated by this Distribution Agreement, and additional information concerning the Company has been or will be prepared and will be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act Rules and Regulations, on or before the second business day after it is first used in connection with the offer and sale of Notes under this Distribution Agreement (or such earlier time as may be required by the Securities Act Rules and Regulations).  The final form of prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement (including any supplement to the Prospectus that sets forth the purchase price, interest rate or formula, maturity date and other terms of a particular issue of Notes (each, a "Pricing Supplement") and all documents incorporated therein by reference), is referred to herein as the "Prospectus," except that if any revised prospectus, whether or not such revised prospectus is required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act Rules and Regulations, shall be provided to the Agents by the Company for use in connection with the offer and sale of any of the Notes under this Distribution Agreement, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to such revised prospectus from and after the time such documents are first provided to the Agents for such use.  All references to the Prospectus shall be deemed to include, without limitation, the information deemed to be included therein pursuant to Rule 430B.  Any registration statement (including any supplement thereto or information which is deemed part thereof) filed by the Company under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act Rules and Regulations (a "Rule 462(b) Registration Statement") shall be deemed to be part of the Registration Statement.  Any prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto or information which is deemed part thereof) included in the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall be deemed to be part of the Prospectus. The term "Time of Sale Prospectus" shall refer to the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time the Registration Statement originally became effective as supplemented by any Prospectus Supplement or preliminary pricing supplement available at the time of any offer of Notes together with any free writing prospectus, as defined under Rule 405 of the Securities Act, available at such time that has been identified in a Written Terms Agreement.  For purposes of this Distribution Agreement, all references to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, any Time of Sale Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto shall be deemed to include any copy filed with the Commission pursuant to its Electronic Data
Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (EDGAR), and such copy shall be identical (except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T) to any Prospectus delivered to any Agent for use in connection with the offering of the Notes by the Company.
 
2.
                                     
Appointment as Agent
.
 
(a)
                                 
Appointment
.  Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to solicit, sell or accept offers for Notes directly on its own behalf, the Company hereby appoints the Agents as its exclusive agents (except as described below), for the purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Notes from the Company by others and, on the basis of the representations and warranties herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each Agent agrees to use reasonable efforts to solicit and receive offers to purchase Notes upon terms acceptable to the Company at such times and in such amounts as the Company shall from time to time specify. The Company agrees that Notes will be sold exclusively to or through the Agents except as otherwise described below.  The Company may accept offers to purchase Notes through an agent other than an Agent (and, in connection therewith, may respond to inquiries and requests for information from any such agents), provided that (i) the Company and such agent shall have executed an agreement with respect to such purchases having terms and conditions (including, without limitation, commission rates) with respect to such purchases substantially the same as the terms and conditions that would apply to such purchases under this Distribution Agreement if such agent were an Agent (which may be accomplished by incorporating by reference in such agreement the terms and conditions of this Distribution Agreement) and (ii) the Company shall provide the Agents with a copy of such agreement promptly following the execution thereof.
 
(b)
                                
Sale of Notes
.  The Company shall not sell or approve the solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes in excess of the amount which shall be authorized by the Company from time to time.  The Agents shall have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to the aggregate initial offering price of Notes sold, or of otherwise monitoring the availability of Notes for sale, under the Registration Statement.
 
(c)
                                 
Purchases as Principal
.  The Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Notes from the Company as principal, but one or more Agents may agree from time to time to purchase Notes as principal for resale to investors and other purchasers determined by such Agent or Agents.  Any such purchase of Notes by an Agent or Agents as principal shall be made in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof.
 
(d)
                                
Solicitations as Agent
.  If agreed upon by an Agent and the Company, such Agent, acting solely as agent for the Company and not as principal, will solicit offers for the purchase of Notes.  Such Agent will communicate to the Company, orally, each offer to purchase Notes solicited by it on an agency basis, other than those offers rejected by such Agent.  Such Agent shall have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed purchase of Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein.  The Company shall have the right to withdraw, cancel or modify any offer hereunder without notice and the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein.  Such Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the
Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by it and accepted by the Company.  Such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event that any such purchase is not consummated for any reason.  If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall (i) hold such Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) notwithstanding such default, pay to such Agent any commission to which it would otherwise be entitled.
 
(e)
                                 
Reliance
.  The Company and the Agents agree that any Notes purchased by one or more Agents as principal shall be purchased, and any Notes the placement of which an Agent arranges as agent shall be placed by such Agent, in reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained herein and on the terms and conditions and in the manner provided herein.
 
3.
                                     
Representations and Warranties of the Company
.  The Company represents and warrants to and agrees with each Agent as of the date hereof, as of the date of each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes (whether to an Agent as principal or through an Agent as agent), as of the Time of Sale (as defined in any Terms Agreement with respect to an issuance of Notes), as of the date of each delivery of Notes (whether to an Agent as principal or through an Agent as agent (each a "Delivery Date")) (the date of each such delivery to an Agent as principal being hereafter referred to as a "Settlement Date"), and as of any time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (it being understood that such representations, warranties and agreements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to each such time) as follows:

If the Company and two or more Agents enter into an agreement pursuant to which such Agents agree to purchase Notes from the Company as principal and one or more of such Agents shall fail at the Settlement Date to purchase the Notes which it or they are obligated to purchase (the "Defaulted Notes"), then the nondefaulting Agents shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one of them or one or more other Agents or underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set forth; provided, however, that if such arrangements shall not have been completed within such 24-hour period, then:
Schedule II
 
(i)
                                    
if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, the nondefaulting Agents shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective initial underwriting obligations bear to the underwriting obligations of all nondefaulting Agents; or
 
(ii)
                                 
if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, such agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent.
 
No action taken pursuant to this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default.  In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of such agreement, either the nondefaulting Agents or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Settlement Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.
 
Unless otherwise specified in a Terms Agreement, if an Agent or Agents are purchasing Notes as principal, it or they, as the case may be, may resell such Notes to other dealers.  Any such sales may be at a discount, which shall not exceed the amount set forth in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Notes.
 
(b)
                                
Solicitations as Agent

Prospectus.  The Agents are not authorized to appoint sub-agents with respect to Notes sold through them as agents.  All Notes sold through an Agent as agent will be sold at 100% of their principal amount unless otherwise agreed to by the Company and such Agent.
 
The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes through an Agent, as agent, commencing at any time for any period of time or permanently.  As soon as practicable, but not later than one business day, after receipt of instructions from the Company, such Agent will suspend solicitation of offers for the purchase of Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised such Agent that such solicitation may be resumed.  During the period of time that such solicitation is suspended, the Company shall not be required to deliver, or cause to be delivered, any opinions, letters, or certificates in accordance with Section 8 hereof; provided that if the Registration Statement or Prospectus is amended or supplemented during the period of suspension (other than by an amendment or supplement providing solely for a change in the interest rates, redemption provisions, amortization schedules or maturities offered for the Notes or for a change that the Agents deem to be immaterial), no Agent shall be required to resume soliciting offers to purchase Notes until the Company have delivered, or cause to be delivered, such opinions, letters and certificates in accordance with Section 8 hereof or as such Agent may reasonably request.
 
Upon settlement, the Company agrees to pay to each Agent, as consideration for the sale of each Note resulting from a solicitation made or an offer to purchase received by such Agent, a commission, in the form of a discount from the purchase price of such Note equal to the applicable percentage of the principal amount of such Note as set forth in hereto.

Administrative procedures with respect to the issuance and sale of Notes shall be agreed upon from time to time by the Company, the Agents and the Trustee (the "Procedures"), and initially such Procedures shall be as set forth in hereto.

Special Conditions for Agents' Purchases as Principal.
  The obligations of the Agents to purchase Notes as principal will be subject to the following further conditions: (i) the rating assigned by each of the Rating Agencies, or any other nationally recognized securities rating agency, to any debt securities of the Company as of the date of the agreement to purchase Notes as principal shall not have been lowered and no such rating agency shall have publicly
announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its ratings of any debt securities of the Company since that date and (ii) there shall not have come to the attention of any Agent any facts that would cause such Agent to believe that the Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of the Notes, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at such time, not misleading.
 
The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 as a condition precedent to each Agent's obligation to begin soliciting offers to purchase Notes as an agent of the Company were originally delivered to the Agents at the San Francisco office of O'Melveny & Myers LLP, counsel for the Agents, on September 6, 2012.  The date of delivery of such documents is referred to herein as the "Commencement Date."
 
All such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Agents and their counsel. The Company will furnish the Agents with such conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as the Agents shall reasonably request.
 
If any condition specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Distribution Agreement may be terminated by any Agent in accordance with Section 13 below (such termination to be effective only with respect to such Agent) and any such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party, except that the covenant regarding provision of an earnings statement set forth in Section 5(f) hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Section 9 hereof, the provisions concerning payment of expenses under Section 10 hereof, the provisions concerning the representations, warranties and agreements to survive delivery of Section 11 hereof, the provisions relating to parties set forth in Section 15 and the provisions relating to governing law set forth in Section 16 hereof shall remain in effect.

In the event that a purchaser shall fail either to accept delivery of or to make payment for a Note on the date fixed for settlement, such Agent shall promptly notify the Company and deliver such Note to the Company and, if such Agent has theretofore paid the Company for such Note, the Company will promptly return such funds to such Agent unless the failure arose from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or from a default by such Agent in the performance of its obligations hereunder.  If such failure occurred for any reason other than the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent or from a default by such Agent in the performance of its obligations hereunder, the Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of the funds for the period such funds were credited to the Company's account.

Indemnification and Contribution
.
 
(a)
          
Indemnification of the Agents by the Company. 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Agents and their directors, officers, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls any Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including, but not limited to, any and all investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any and all amounts paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding between any of the indemnified parties and any indemnifying parties or between any indemnified party and any third party, or otherwise, or any claim asserted), as and when incurred, to which an Agent, or any such person, may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or in any documents filed under the Exchange Act and deemed
to be incorporated by reference into the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any application or other document executed by or on behalf of the Company or based on written information furnished by or on behalf of the Company filed in any jurisdiction in order to qualify the Notes under the securities laws thereof or filed with the Commission, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in such document a material fact required to be stated in it or necessary to make the statements in it not misleading or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by an Agent in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Notes or the offering contemplated hereby, and which is included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, liability, expense or damage arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent it is finally judicially determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by an Agent through gross negligence or willful misconduct); provided that the Company will not be liable to the extent that such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage arises from the sale of the Notes to any person by an Agent and is based on an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to an Agent furnished in writing to the Company by such Agent expressly for inclusion in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
 
(b)
          
Indemnification of the Company and its Directors, Certain Officers and Control Persons by the Agents
.  The Agents will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each director of the Company and each officer of the Company who signs the Registration Statement to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the each Agent, but only insofar as losses, claims, liabilities, expenses or damages arise out of or are based on any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with information relating to an Agent furnished in writing to the Company by such Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any other free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus.  This indemnity will be in addition to any liability that an Agent might otherwise have; provided, however, that in no case shall an Agent be liable or responsible for any amount in excess of the total discount or commission received by such Agent in connection with the offering of the Notes that were the subject of the claim for indemnification.
 
(c)
          
Procedures.
  Any party that proposes to assert the right to be indemnified under this Section 9 will, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party or parties under this Section 9, notify each such indemnifying party of the commencement of such action, enclosing a copy of all papers served, but the omission so to notify such indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party under the foregoing provisions of this Section 9 unless, and only to the extent that, such omission results in the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses by the indemnifying party.  If any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of its commencement, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it
elects by delivering written notice to the indemnified party promptly after receiving notice of the commencement of the action from the indemnified party, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense of the action, with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal or other expenses except as provided below and except for the reasonable costs of investigation subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense.  The indemnified party will have the right to employ its own counsel in any such action, but the fees, expenses and other charges of such counsel will be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the employment of counsel by the indemnified party has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) a conflict or potential conflict exists (based on advice of counsel to the indemnified party) between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party (in which case the indemnifying party will not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party) or (iv) the indemnifying party has not in fact employed counsel to assume the defense of such action within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the commencement of the action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel will be at the expense of the indemnifying party or parties.  It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any time for all such indemnified party or parties.  All such fees, disbursements and other charges will be reimbursed by the indemnifying party promptly as they are incurred.  An indemnifying party will not be liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of each indemnified party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding relating to the matters contemplated by this Section 9 (whether or not any indemnified party is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes a unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising or that may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding.
 
(d)
          
Contribution.
  In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in the foregoing paragraphs of this Section 9 is applicable in accordance with its terms but for any reason is held to be unavailable from the Company or the Agents, the Company and any applicable Agent will contribute to the total losses, claims, liabilities, expenses and damages (including any investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any claim asserted, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company from persons other than an Agent, such as persons who control the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, who also may be liable for contribution) to which the Company and any applicable Agent may be subject in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and any applicable Agent on the other.  The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and any applicable Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of any
Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by applicable Agent or Agents.  If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and any applicable Agent, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering.  Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or an Agent, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 9(d) shall be deemed to include, for purpose of this Section 9(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9(d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the commissions and other compensation received by such Agent and no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 9(d), any person who controls a party to this Distribution Agreement within the meaning of the Securities Act will have the same rights to contribution as that party, and each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement will have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the provisions hereof.  Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made under this Section 9(d), will notify any such party or parties from whom contribution may be sought but the omission so to notify will not relieve the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have under this Section 9(d).  No party will be liable for contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).
 
(e)
          
Survival of Indemnity and Contribution Provisions.
  The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 9 and the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Distribution Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by an Agent or on its behalf, (ii) acceptance of any of the Notes and payment therefore or (iii) any termination of this Distribution Agreement.
 
10.
         
Reimbursement of Agents' Expenses
.  If the Company shall fail to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, or if any condition of the Agents' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse any applicable Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by such Agent in connection with this Distribution Agreement, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to such Agent.  If this Distribution Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13 by reason of the default of any Agent, the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse such Agent on account of those expenses.
11.
         
Representations and Agreements to Survive Delivery
.  All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Distribution Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or any con-trolling person of such Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries, and shall survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Notes.
 
12.
         
Role of Agents
.  In acting under this Agreement and in connection with the sale of any Notes by the Company (other than Notes sold to an Agent as principal), each Agent is acting solely as agent of the Company and does not assume any obligation towards or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of Notes.  An Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason.  If the Company shall default in its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company shall hold the relevant Agent harmless against any loss, claim, damage or liability arising from or as a result of such default and shall, in particular, pay to such Agent the commission it would have received had such sale been consummated.
 
13.
         
Termination
.  The Company shall have the right to terminate this Distribution Agreement with respect to any or all of the Agents at any time by giving notice hereunder to the Agents as hereinafter specified.  Each Agent shall have the right by giving notice as hereinafter specified to terminate this Distribution Agreement and/or any Terms Agreement hereunder at any time, provided that if such termination would occur on or after the date of such Terms Agreement and prior to the Settlement Date with respect to such Terms Agreement, any Agent may terminate this Distribution Agreement and such Terms Agreement only if (i) the Company shall have failed, refused or been unable, at any time, to perform any agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of the Agents' obligations hereunder is not fulfilled when due, (iii) the rating assigned by either of the Rating Agencies to the Company or the Notes as of or subsequent to the date of this Distribution Agreement shall have been lowered since that date or if either of the Rating Agencies shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review for the purpose of considering lowering such rating, its rating of the Company or the Notes, (iv) trading in any of the equity securities of the Company shall have been suspended by the Commission, FINRA or by an exchange that lists such equity securities or by the Nasdaq Stock Market, (v) trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on such exchange or over the counter market, or additional material governmental restrictions, not in force on the date of this Agreement, shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by such exchange or by order of the Commission or FINRA or any court or other governmental authority, (vi) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, (vii) any material adverse change in the financial or securities markets in the United States or in political, financial or economic conditions in the United States or any outbreak or material escalation of hostilities or declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or other calamity or crisis shall have occurred the effect of any of which is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Agents, impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus and the Time of Sale Prospectus, or (viii) if there
shall have come to the attention of the Agents any facts that would cause them to believe that the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Prospectus, at the time it was required to be delivered to a purchaser of Notes, included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing at the time of such delivery, not misleading.  Any such termination notice shall be effective only with respect to such Agent.  As used in this Section 13, the term "Prospectus" means the Prospectus in the form first provided to the Agents for use in confirming sales of the related Notes.  In the event of any such termination, neither party will have any liability to the other party hereto, except that (i) an Agent shall be entitled to any commission earned in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 4(b) hereof, (ii) if at the time of termination (a) such Agent shall own any Notes purchased by it as principal with the intention of reselling them or (b) an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 8 hereof shall remain in effect until such Notes are so resold or delivered, as the case may be, and (iii) the covenant set forth in Section 5(f) hereof, the provisions of Section 10 hereof, the indemnity and contribution agreements set forth in Section 9 hereof, and the provisions of Sections 11, 15 and 16 hereof shall remain in effect.

The following terms, if applicable, shall be agreed to by an Agent or Agents and the Company in connection with each sale of Notes:
 
 
 
The Medium-Term Notes Due Nine Months or More from Date of Issue (the "Notes") are to be offered on a continuous basis by AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Issuer").  Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and UBS Securities LLC (the "Agents"), have each agreed to use their best efforts to solicit purchases of the Notes.  The Issuer reserves the right to sell Notes directly or indirectly on its own behalf to investors (other than broker-dealers).  The Agents will not be obligated to, but may from time to time, purchase Notes as principal for their own account.  The Notes are being sold pursuant to a Distribution Agreement dated September 6, 2012 (the "Agency Agreement"), among the Issuer, and the Agents, and will be issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of January 16, 1998 and all indentures supplemental thereto, including that certain First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 20, 1998, that certain Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 7, 1998, that certain Amended and Restated Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 10, 2000, and that certain Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated September 18, 2006 (collectively, the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to State Street Bank and Trust Company and US Bank, National Association), as Trustee (the "Trustee").  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agency Agreement.  The Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
 
Each Note will be represented by either a Global Security (as defined in the Indenture), such Global Security, for purposes hereof either a global note (a "Global Note") or a master note (a "Master Note"), registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, as Depositary ("DTC") (a "Book-Entry Note"), or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificated Note").  It is currently contemplated that both Notes that bear interest at a fixed rate (a "Fixed Rate Note") and Notes that bear interest at a variable rate (a "Floating Rate Note") and that are denominated and payable in U.S. dollars may be issued as Book-Entry Notes.
 
Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below.  The Issuer will advise the Agents in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agents are to communicate regarding offers to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery.  Administrative procedures may be modified from time to time as reflected in the applicable Pricing Supplement (as defined below) or elsewhere.
 
 
The following explains the administrative procedures for the Global Note method of the DTC book-entry system.  Any reference to "Book-Entry Notes" in this Part II refers to the Global Note method (for a discussion of the Master Note method of the DTC book-entry system, see Part III below).  Certain generally applicable administrative procedures are set forth in Part I above (See "Issue/Authentication Date," "Price to Public," "Minimum Purchase," "Authenticity of Signatures," "Advertising Cost," and "Business Day").  In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, the Trustee will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations (the "Letter") from the Issuer and the Trustee to DTC dated December 21, 1998, and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee and DTC and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").  Both Fixed and Floating Rate Notes denominated and payable in U.S. dollars may be issued in book-entry form.  Single and Multi-Indexed Notes may also be issued in book-entry form.

Reopening of Issue.
  The Company may, from time to time and without the consent of the noteholders, reopen an issue of notes and issue additional notes having the same terms and conditions (including maturity, interest payment terms and CUSIP number) as notes issued on an earlier date, except for the issue date, issue price and, if applicable, the first payment of interest. After such additional notes are issued, they will be fungible with the notes issued on such earlier date.
 
Optional Redemption.
  The Notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of AvalonBay, in whole or in part, upon notice of not more than 60 and not less than 30 days prior to the Redemption Date, at a Redemption Price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date and (ii) the Make-Whole Amount, if any, with respect to such Note.    If the Notes are redeemed on or after 90 days prior to the Maturity Date, the Redemption Price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date.
 
Acceleration of Maturity; Make-Whole Amount.
  If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes that are then outstanding occurs and is continuing, and pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Amended and Restated Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of July 10, 2000 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of this series shall have declared the principal amount (or, if the Notes of this series are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms hereof) of all the Notes of this series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to AvalonBay (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), then upon any such declaration such principal, or specified portion thereof, plus accrued interest to the date the Notes of this series are paid, plus the Make-Whole Amount on the Notes shall become immediately due and payable. With respect to the Notes of this series, if an Event of Default set forth in Section 501(6) of the Indenture, dated as of January 16, 1998, between AvalonBay and the Trustee (the "Indenture") occurs and is continuing, such that pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Third Supplemental Indenture all the Notes of this series are immediately due and payable, without notice to AvalonBay, at the principal amount thereof (or, if the Notes of this series are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms of the Notes) plus accrued interest to the date the Notes are paid, then the Make-Whole Amount on the Notes shall also be immediately due and payable.
 
Definitions.
  Terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture and the Third Supplemental Indenture. The following terms shall have the following meanings:
 
"Make-Whole Amount" means, in connection with any optional redemption or accelerated payment of any Note, the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of such redemption or accelerated payment of each dollar of principal being redeemed or paid and the amount of
 
interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption or accelerated payment) that would have been payable in respect of such dollar if such redemption or accelerated payment had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semi-annual basis, such principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate (determined on the third Business Day preceding the date such notice of Redemption is given or declaration of acceleration is made) from the respective dates on which such principal and interest would have been payable if such redemption or accelerated payment had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being redeemed or paid.
 
"Reinvestment Rate" means twenty (20) basis points plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the respective headings "This Week" and "Last Week" published in the Statistical Release under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month) corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the payment date of the principal being redeemed or paid. If no maturity exactly corresponds to such maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to such maturity shall be calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and the Reinvestment Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding in each of such relevant periods to the nearest month. For such purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate, the most recent Statistical Release published prior to the date of determination of the Make-Whole Amount shall be used.
 
"Statistical Release" means the statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States government securities adjusted to constant maturities or, if such statistical release is not published at the time of any determination of the Make-Whole Amount, then such other reasonably comparable index which shall be designated by AvalonBay.

Re:  Legality of Securities to be Registered Under Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to you in connection with your filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179720) (as amended or supplemented, the "Registration Statement") filed on February 27, 2012 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), relating to the registration of the offer by AvalonBay Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company")  of an unlimited amount of any combination of securities of the types specified therein.  The Registration Statement became effective pursuant to the rules of the Commission upon filing on February 27, 2012.  Reference is made to our opinion letter dated February 27, 2012 and included as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement.  We are delivering this supplemental opinion letter in connection with the prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") filed on September 6, 2012 by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act.  The Prospectus Supplement relates to the offering by the Company of $450,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 2.95% Notes due 2022 (the "Notes") covered by the Registration Statement.  We understand that the Notes are to be offered and sold in the manner described in the Prospectus Supplement.
 
We have reviewed such documents and made such examination of law as we have deemed appropriate to give the opinions set forth below.  We have relied, without independent verification, on certificates of public officials and, as to matters of fact material to the opinions set forth below, on certificates of officers of the Company.
 
We refer to (a) the Indenture, dated as of January 16, 1998, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to State Street Bank and Trust Company) (the "Trustee"), (b) the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 20, 1998, between the Company and the Trustee, (c) the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 7, 1998, between the Company and the Trustee, (d) the Amended and Restated Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 10, 2000, between the Company and the Trustee and (e) the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of September 18, 2006, between the Company and the Trustee collectively as the "Indenture."
 
The opinion expressed below is limited to the law of New York and the Maryland General Corporation Law.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the additional qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that, upon the execution, authentication and issuance of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes will be valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinion expressed above is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and to general principles of equity. We express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of provisions in the Notes or the Indenture relating to the choice of forum for resolving disputes.
 
This opinion letter and the opinion it contains shall be interpreted in accordance with the Legal Opinion Principles issued by the Committee on Legal Opinions of the American Bar Association's Business Law Section as published in 53 Business Lawyer 831 (May 1998).
 
We hereby consent to the inclusion of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Registration Statement and to the references to our firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Registration Statement.  In giving our consent, we do not admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
