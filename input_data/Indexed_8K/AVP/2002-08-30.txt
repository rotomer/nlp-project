Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure. The Company has advised participants in its U.S. Personal Savings Account Plan (401(k) Plan) that there will be a blackout period from Friday, September 27, 2002 through Sunday, October 13, 2002, during which Plan participants will be unable to engage in Plan transactions. The blackout results from the Company's move to a new benefits service provider and the need to ensure a complete and accurate transfer of Plan data. On August 28, 2002, the Company advised its executive officers and the members of its Board of Directors that they must not engage in any transactions in Company stock, including stock option exercises, during the 401(k) Plan blackout period.
