Item 5. Other Events. 1. On January 30, 2003 the Company issued a press release announcing that it had agreed with J.C. Penney to end the business relationship pursuant to which the Company's beComing line of products has been carried in approximately 90 J.C. Penney stores. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference. 2. Polish subsidiaries of the Company have been responding to Protocols of Inspection served by the Polish tax authorities in respect of 1999 and 2000 tax audits. The Protocols asserted tax deficiencies, penalties and accruing interest totaling approximately $24 million at current exchange rates: $11 million primarily relating to the documentation of certain sales, and $13 million relating to excise taxes. The procedural rules for conducting audits in Poland changed effective January 1, 2003, and the Company was informed on January 14, 2003 and January 17, 2003, respectively, that the tax authorities had rejected the Company's factual assertions regarding the alleged tax deficiencies. Under the new procedures, the matters now await the commencement of a second stage of proceeding at which the applicable legal conclusions will be determined. In the event that assessments are finally established at the second stage of the proceedings, it may be necessary to pay the assessments in order to pursue further appeals, which may result in a charge to income. Management believes that there are meritorious defenses to these proceedings and they are being vigorously contested. It is not possible to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of expense that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings but management does not believe that the proceedings ultimately will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. On December 20, 2002 a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company received a series of tax assessments from the Brazilian tax authorities asserting that the establishment in 1995 of separate manufacturing and distribution companies in that country was done without a valid business purpose. The assessments assert tax deficiencies during portions of the years 1997 and 1998 of approximately $50 million at the current exchange rate, plus penalties and accruing interest totaling approximately $84 million at the current exchange rate. In the event that the assessments are upheld in the earlier stages of review, it may be necessary for the Company to provide security to pursue further appeals, which, depending on the circumstances, may result in a charge to income. It is not possible to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of expense that could result from an unfavorable outcome in respect of these or any additional assessments that may be issued for subsequent periods. The structure adopted in 1995 is comparable to that used by many companies in Brazil, and the Company believes it is appropriate, both operationally and legally, and that the assessments are unfounded. This matter is being vigorously contested and in the opinion of the Company's outside counsel the likelihood that the assessments ultimately will be upheld is remote. Management believes that the likelihood that the assessments will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements is also remote.

Penney End Retail Alliance NEW YORK, N.Y., January 30, 2003 - Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today announced a strategic repositioning of its beComing beauty brand in the U.S. Following a strategic review of options to optimize the brand, Avon has decided that beComing will now be sold through Avon's direct selling channel in the U.S. exclusively by Avon Beauty Advisors, who are independent Avon sales Representatives with specialized beauty product training and consultative selling skills. Accordingly, Avon has agreed with J.C. Penney to end the alliance through which beComing had been carried in approximately 90 J.C. Penney stores. Commenting on the decision, Andrea Jung, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our research confirms that consumer reaction to this prestige brand has been very positive. By offering beComing through our core business, we expect to accelerate sales of the brand, advance earnings for our Beauty Advisors, and attract new customers with a high-quality, premium product line. "Our direct selling channel in the U.S. has been enjoying robust growth and just completed one of its strongest years ever. We therefore see an outstanding opportunity to leverage the beComing brand with the beauty selling skills of our Avon Beauty Advisors," Ms. Jung said. "Avon remains committed to a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy and we will continue to pursue opportunities to reach new customer segments that prefer a retail shopping experience," Ms. Jung added. She also said Avon's retail president, Steve Bock, a retail beauty industry veteran, will continue to lead Avon's efforts to develop its long-term retail strategy. Avon said details for withdrawing beComing from J.C. Penney are still being finalized, however it doesn't anticipate that costs associated with repositioning the brand will affect the company's earnings outlook for 2003. More than 35,000 of Avon's approximately 500,000 independent sales Representatives in the U.S. are in various stages of completing their training as Beauty Advisors. Training includes three comprehensive phases that develop extensive beauty product knowledge and consultative selling skills. Representatives who have completed the training typically generate higher sales of beauty products than other Representatives. Avon introduced the Beauty Advisor program in 2000. Brian C. Connolly, president, Avon North America, said, "We are very excited to bring beComing to our Beauty Advisors. Sales of beComing will enrich their earnings opportunity, and enable them to win new customers who enjoy prestige beauty products. In addition, beComing will enhance Avon's position as a world-class direct selling company, and provide Avon Beauty Advisors with a clear competitive advantage." Avon said that the beComing line to be sold by the Avon Beauty Advisors will focus on the primary beauty categories of skin care, color cosmetics and fragrance. The company also plans new product launches to expand the line. Avon Beauty Advisors will sell beComing to their customers using a dedicated brochure which will be updated quarterly. Beauty Advisors will also continue to sell the company's full line of products. Avon is the world's leading direct seller of beauty and related products, with approximately $6.0 billion in annual revenues. Avon markets to women in 143 countries through 3.5 million independent sales Representatives. Avon product lines include such recognizable brand names as Avon Color, Anew, Skin-So-Soft, Advance Techniques Hair Care, beComing and Avon Wellness. Avon also markets an extensive line of fashion jewelry and apparel. More information about Avon and its products can be found on the company's web site www.avon.com. # # #
