Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 3, 2004, Avon issued a press release to supplement Avon's earlier announcement of its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2003. A copy of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, N.Y., February 3, 2004  Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reiterated that its previous guidance of December 8, 2003 of $1.03-$1.04 included an approximate $.05 benefit per share from a tax audit settlement in the quarter. Today's reported results of $1.09 per diluted share versus $.80 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2002, are $.05-$.06 ahead of previous guidance due to positive impact of currency translation, stronger than anticipated operating results, lower net interest expense, a lower rate and lower than expected severance expense related to business transformation initiatives.
