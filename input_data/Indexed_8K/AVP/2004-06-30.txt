Item 5. Other Events.
On June 24, 2004 the Court of Appeal of the State of California issued an Alternative Writ of Mandate and Order in the matter of Blakemore et al. v. Avon Products, Inc. et al. mandating that the Superior Court vacate its prior rulings dismissing substantial elements of plaintiffs' Second and Third Amended Complaints or, in the alternative, show cause why such a mandate should not issue. Avon will contest the court's order. Separately, plaintiffs have pending with the Superior Court a motion for reconsideration of the court's decision striking plaintiffs' class allegations in this matter, which decision was unaffected by the action of the Court of Appeal.
