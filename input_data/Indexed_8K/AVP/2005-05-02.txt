Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, N.Y., May 2, 2005  Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported earnings for the first quarter of 2005 of $.36 per share, up 16% from last year's first-quarter earnings of $.31 per share and $.01 ahead of expectations due to strong operating profit growth.
     
Avon also raised its previous full-year 2005 earnings outlook to $2.12 - $2.17 per share from $1.95 - $2.00 per share, reflecting a second-quarter benefit of approximately $80 million, or about $.17 per share, relating to prior years' tax-audit settlements.

Avon said that in the first quarter of 2005, revenue grew 7% -- on top of a 20% gain in last year's first quarter -- to $1.88 billion. Local-currency revenue rose 4%, with units up 3% and active Representatives up 9%. Sales of Beauty products were 8% higher, with solid advances in every category.
     
Operating profit increased 14% in the quarter. Operating margin improved 90-basis points to 13.9%, and gross margin expanded 60-basis points to 62.9% . Net income in the quarter was $172.0 million, compared with $148.1 million in the year-ago period.
First-Quarter 2005 Regional Highlights
     
In the U.S., as expected, revenue and operating profit in the first quarter of 2005 decreased 6% and 15%, respectively, versus the first quarter of 2004. Beauty sales declined 10% reflecting the challenge of anniversarying a 32% increase in skin care during the prior-year period, as well as the timing of product innovation. Beauty Plus sales increased 7% and Beyond Beauty sales declined 12% as expected, in line with the planned mix shift between these two categories as part of the repositioning strategy for this market. Units and active Representatives declined 9% and 1%, respectively. Operating margin was 14.8%, or 150-basis points below the prior-year quarter.
     
In Europe, first-quarter revenue and operating profit increased 17% and 26%, respectively, on top of the 38% and 84% respective gains from a year ago. Local-currency revenue in the first quarter of 2005 grew 10%, driven by growth in units and active Representatives of 6% and 13%, respectively. Operating margin in the region advanced to 20.7%, up 150-basis points year over year even after more than doubling advertising and investing 80-basis points of margin to launch the company's ERP initiative in the region.

Topline growth in Europe in the first quarter was impacted by the U.K., where revenues were 3% lower compared with the year-ago period as the U.K. anniversaried the highly successful launch of
Anew Clinical Line and Wrinkle Corrector.
Revenues in Central and Eastern Europe increased 27% in the quarter, with Russia up 24% on top of extraordinary 89% growth in the prior-year quarter.
     
In Latin America, first-quarter revenue grew 10% in dollars and 8% in local currency as continued strong growth in Brazil and Venezuela more than offset softer sales in Mexico. Units rose 5%, and active Representatives were up 10%. Operating profit increased 12%, and operating margin was 20.6%, up 40-basis points year over year.
     
The Asia Pacific region posted first-quarter revenue growth of 10% in dollars and 8% in local currency, driven by gains in units and active Representatives of 16% and 12%, respectively. Operating profit rose 20% and operating margin increased to 18.5%, up 150-basis points year over year. China, Avon's largest long-term growth opportunity, was again the biggest contributor to the region's growth, with revenue up nearly 40%. In April 2005, Avon China was approved as the first company to conduct a direct-selling test in that market.
Second-Quarter Outlook
     
Avon said that revenue growth in the second-quarter 2005 should accelerate ahead of the first quarter, with dollar-denominated and local-currency growth expected to be in the ranges of 10% and 6%, respectively. Operating profit is forecast to increase approximately in line with revenue growth, including an acceleration of consumer investments in emerging markets as well as funding for the China direct-selling test.

Avon said that it expects U.S. results in the second quarter to be in line with those of the first quarter as it continues to reposition the U.S. business for improved performance in the second half of this year and a return to profitable growth in 2006. With regard to the second-quarter outlook for each international region, the company said that Europe's revenue is projected to grow in the high teens, with operating profit increasing slightly ahead of revenue. Latin America's revenue and operating profit should each increase in the mid-teens. Asia Pacific's revenue is expected to be up double-digits while operating profit should grow in the high-single digits.
     
In addition, Avon said that second-quarter earnings are forecast to be in the range of $.66 per share, reflecting a non-cash benefit of approximately $80 million, or about $.17 per share, relating to prior years' tax-audit settlements. This compares to earnings of $.49 per share in last year's second quarter, which included a tax benefit of $.05 per share. The company said that additional tax settlements are possible during 2005, which could result in further benefits.
     
Commenting on the year, Andrea Jung, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer said, "We're pleased with Avon's performance in the first quarter, especially given the very challenging year-over-year comparisons. Looking ahead, we're projecting that local-currency revenue will accelerate, as increased innovation in our second-half product pipeline drives stronger Beauty sales. Continuing strong results in our international regions are offsetting U.S. performance during this period of repositioning, with our emerging markets once again expected to deliver another full year of stand-out revenue growth," she said.
