On August 17, 2005 a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Docket Number 05 cv 7287) naming officers and directors of the Company. The action, entitled
Robert L. Garber, derivatively on behalf of Avon Products, Inc., v. Andrea Jung et al. as defendants, and Avon Products, Inc. as nominal
defendant
, was purportedly brought on behalf of the Company and alleges that defendants' violations of state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment between April 2005 and the present, have caused losses to the Company.
On August 2, 2005 the Company reported the filing of a class action complaint for alleged violations of the federal securities laws, brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock between April 8, 2005 and July 18, 2005. In that report the Company indicated that additional similar complaints may be filed in the future and that the Company did not intend to announce the filing of any similar complaints. One such complaint was filed on August 5, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Docket Number 05 cv 7015). That action, entitled

., was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's securities between February 1, 2005 and July 18, 2005. The complaint also asserts that during the class period insiders sold shares of the Company's common stock.
The Company is not undertaking to announce the filing of any similar complaints in the future.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
