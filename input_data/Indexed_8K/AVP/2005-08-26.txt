ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
     
On August 23, 2005, Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") and Avon Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("ACC" and, together with the Company, the "Borrowers"), entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank of America Credit Agreement"). On the same date, the Borrowers also entered into a separate Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., on substantially the same terms as the Bank of America Credit Agreement (the "Citibank Credit Agreement" and, together with the Bank of America Credit Agreement, the "Credit Agreements"). The Credit Agreements incorporate by reference certain terms and conditions of the existing $600,000,000 Revolving Credit and Competitive Advance Facility Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2001, among the Borrowers, the lenders party thereto, and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as administrative agent for such lenders (the "Existing Facility"). The Credit Agreements, like the Existing Facility, are available for general corporate purposes, including to support issuances of commercial paper.
     
Each of the Credit Agreements provides for a $200.0 million revolving credit facility, of which the entire amount is currently undrawn and available under both Credit Agreements. The Company has provided an unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of ACC's obligations under each of the Credit Agreements. Amounts under the Credit Agreements may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by the Borrowers (pro rata between the two Credit Agreements) from time to time until the maturity of the Credit Agreements on August 22, 2006. Upon the issuance by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any debt securities in the capital markets with a maturity in excess of one year and in an amount of at least $100,000,000, the Credit Agreements shall be reduced (pro rata between the two Credit Agreements) by the amount of the net cash proceeds thereof on the fifth business day after the receipt of such proceeds. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Credit Agreements are permitted at any time without fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the prepayment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under each of the Credit Agreements bear interest at a floating rate, which will be, at the Borrowers' option, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of the Company, or a base rate.
     
Each of the Credit Agreements incorporates by reference the affirmative, negative and financial covenants in the Existing Facility, which are customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the incurrence of liens and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Each of the Credit Agreements also incorporates by reference the events of default in the Existing Facility, which are customary for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. Also under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreements shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments will automatically terminate.
     
Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A. and their respective affiliates provide or have provided a variety of financial services to the Company and its affiliates, including investment banking, cash management, equipment financing and leasing services, the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements.
     The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit Agreements, and reference is made to the complete text of these agreements, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, as well as the complete text of the Existing Facility, which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 4 to the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2001.
     
The disclosure required by this item is included in Item 1.01 and is incorporated herein by reference.

GREEMENT
dated as of August 23, 2005 among Avon Products, Inc., a New York corporation ("
API
"), Avon Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
ACC
" and collectively with API, the "
Borrowers
"), and Bank of America, N.A. ("
Bank of America
"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the same meanings as specified therefor in the Amended and Restated $600,000,000 Revolving Credit and Competitive Advance Facility Agreement dated as of May 1, 2001 (as in effect on the date hereof, the "
Existing Credit Agreement
") among the Borrowers, the Additional Borrowers, the lenders party thereto, and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as administrative agent for such lenders.
     
SECTION 1.
The Advances
. (a) Bank of America hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make advances (each, an "
Advance
") denominated in U.S. dollars to the Borrowers from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the date of this Agreement to (but not including) the Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $200,000,000 (the "
Facility
"). Each Advance shall be made at the same time and in the same principal amount as borrowings under the credit agreement to be entered into on the date hereof with Citibank, N.A. (the "
Citibank Facility
"), which credit agreement shall be identical in all material respects to this Agreement and shall provide for a committed revolving credit facility to be made available to the Borrowers in the same amount and on the same terms and conditions as the Facility. Within the limits of the unused portion of the Facility in effect from time to time, any Borrower may borrow under this Section 1(a), prepay pursuant to Section 1(e) and reborrow under this Section 1(a).
     
(b) A Borrower may request an Advance hereunder by giving notice thereof (a "
Notice of Borrowing
"), not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time), (A) on the Business Day of such Advance for Advances bearing interest by reference to the Base Rate (as defined below) ("
Base Rate Advances
") or (B) on the third Business Days prior to such Advance for Advances bearing interest by reference to LIBOR ("
Eurodollar Rate Advances
"), which Notice of Borrowing sets forth the same information as is required to be included in comparable Revolving Credit Loan Requests delivered under the Existing Credit Agreement and an additional certification by the applicable Borrower that a borrowing under the Citibank Facility has been requested to be made at the same time and in the same amount as the related Advance to be made hereunder by Bank of America. Upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Sections 2, if applicable, and 3, Bank of America will make the proceeds of such Advance available to the Borrower requesting such Advance at the account specified by such Borrower in the related Notice of Borrowing. All Notices of Borrowing may be delivered by telephone and confirmed in writing. For purposes of this Agreement, "
Base Rate
" means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum in effect from time to time, which rate per annum shall be equal to the highest of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced by Bank of America in New York, New York as its prime rate in effect on such day and (b) the sum of (i)  of 1% per annum and (ii) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day. Further, for purposes of this Agreement, the definition of "Interest Period" (as incorporated herein by reference) shall be deemed to mean periods ending seven days, one month, two months or three months after (x) the date of borrowing of the applicable Advance or (y) the last day of the preceding Interest Period, subject to clauses (i), (iii) and (except in the case of an Interest Period of seven days) (ii) of the definition of Interest Period set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement.
     
(c) The Facility shall be automatically terminated and each Borrower shall repay to Bank of America the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Advances made to it, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, on the earlier of August 22, 2006 and the date of the termination of
the Facility in full pursuant to Section 1 hereof or Article 8 of the Existing Credit Agreement as incorporated by reference (the "
Termination Date
"). Upon the issuance by API or any of its Subsidiaries of any debt security in the capital markets with a maturity in excess of one year and in an amount of $100,000,000 or more, the Facility shall automatically reduce by an amount equal to 50% of the net cash proceeds from any such issuance on the fifth Business Day after the date of receipt by API or its Subsidiaries of such proceeds.
     
(d) API may, upon at least three Business Days' notice to Bank of America, terminate in whole or reduce in part the unused portions of the Facility,
provided
that the Facility shall be reduced on any date on which the Citibank Facility is being reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the reduction of the Citibank Facility being made on such date. The Borrowers shall, on each date of a reduction in the Facility as set forth in Section 1(c) above or this Section 1(d), repay the Advances in a principal amount equal to the excess of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Advances over the Facility as so reduced.
     
(e) Either Borrower may, upon notice given to Bank of America not later than 10:30 A.M. (New York City time) (i) on the date of the proposed prepayment, in the case of a prepayment of Base Rate Advances or (ii) on the third Business Day prior to the date of prepayment, in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the aggregate principal amount of the Advances specified in such notice, provided, however, that the Borrowers shall prepay Advances outstanding hereunder on any date on which outstanding advances are being prepaid under the Citibank Facility by an amount equal to the amount of the outstanding advances under the Citibank Facility being so prepaid on such date. All notices of prepayment may be given by telephone confirmed in writing. All prepayments under this Section 1(e) shall be made together with (i) accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount so prepaid and (ii) in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor, any amounts owing in respect of Eurodollar Rate Advances pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Existing Credit Agreement as incorporated herein by reference.
     
(f) Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to it from the date of such Advance until the principal amount thereof is paid in full on the dates for payment specified for advances of the same type under the Existing Credit Agreement and a rate per annum equal, in the case of Base Rate Advances, to the Base Rate in effect from time to time and, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, to the sum of the Eurodollar LIBOR in effect for the applicable Interest Period
plus
0.20% per annum. Similarly, API shall pay a facility fee on the Facility from the date of this Agreement to the Termination Date at the rate of 0.05% per annum.
     
(g) Each Borrower shall make each payment hereunder, irrespective of any right of counterclaim or setoff, not later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars and in same day funds to Bank of America at the account of Bank of America most recently specified in writing to the Borrowers by Bank of America. All computations of interest determined by reference to clause (a) of the definition of "Base Rate" and of facility fees payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all other computations of interest payable hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable.
     
(h) The proceeds of the Advances shall be available for general corporate purposes, which shall include the use thereof, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental
or ultimate, of funding or making payments on account of the purchase, redemption and retirement by API of any shares of capital stock of API or any related option, warrant or similar right.

(a) the representations and warranties incorporated by reference into this Agreement from Section 5.01 of the Existing Credit Agreement (other than the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.01(d)(ii) and 5.01(e) of the Existing Credit Agreement, as incorporated herein by reference, or any other representations or warranties that expressly relate to a date certain) are true and correct with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made at the time of such Advance;
      (b) no Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and
     
(c) a borrowing under the Citibank Facility has been requested to be made at the same time and in the same amount as such Advance is to be made by Bank of America.
