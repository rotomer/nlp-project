Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     
On August 31, 2005, Avon Capital Corporation ("ACC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company"), increased the size of its existing commercial paper program from $600 million to $1.0 billion. Under the program, ACC may issue from time to time unsecured promissory notes, guaranteed by the Company, in the commercial paper market in private placements exempt from registration under federal and state securities laws, for a cumulative face amount not to exceed $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time and with maturities not exceeding 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper short-term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and will not be subject to voluntary prepayment. The existing $600 million five-year credit facility and $400 million 364-day credit facilities of ACC and the Company, with expiration dates of May 2006 and August 2006, respectively, are available to support issuances of commercial paper as well as for general corporate purposes. Currently, approximately $471 million of commercial paper short-term notes is outstanding under the program.
     
The Company has amended its guarantee to reflect the increase in size to $1.0 billion of the commercial paper program. The guarantee provides for an unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of ACC's obligations under the commercial paper short-term notes that may be issued from time to time under the $1.0 billion program. The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the guarantee, and reference is made to the complete text of the guarantee, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
