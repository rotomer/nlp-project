Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     
On January 13, 2006, Avon Products, Inc. (the Company) and Avon Capital Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (ACC and, together with the Company, the Borrowers), entered into a $1.0 billion Revolving Credit and Competitive Advance Facility Agreement with Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and the other lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement replaces the $600.0 million Revolving Credit and Competitive Advance Facility Agreement, dated as of May 1, 2001, among the Borrowers, the lenders party thereto, and The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Administrative Agent for such lenders (the 2001 Credit Agreement), which contained terms and conditions similar to those in the Credit Agreement and was terminated on January 13, 2006 prior to its scheduled expiration date of May 1, 2006.
     
The Borrowers' $200.0 million credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., dated as of August 23, 2005 (the Bank of America Credit Agreement), and $200.0 million credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., dated as of August 23, 2005 (the Citibank Credit Agreement and, together with the Bank of America Credit Agreement, the 2005 Credit Agreements) will automatically terminate as of January 18, 2006, prior to the stated expiration date of August 22, 2006, as a result of the Company's issuance of $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Notes due 2011 on January 10, 2006. The 2005 Credit Agreements incorporate by reference certain terms and conditions of the 2001 Credit Agreement. There were, or will be, no amounts outstanding under the 2001 Credit Agreement and the 2005 Credit Agreements on the respective dates of termination and no early termination penalties were, or will be, incurred by the Borrowers.
     
The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, subject to possible extension of the term by up to two years and possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of $250.0 million, any such extension or increase being subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is available for general corporate purposes, including to support issuances of commercial paper. The Company has provided an unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of ACC's obligations under the Credit Agreement. Amounts under the Credit Agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by the Borrowers from time to time until the maturity of the Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions requested by the Company under the Credit Agreement are permitted at any time without fee (other than customary breakage costs relating to the prepayment of any drawn loans) upon proper notice and subject to a minimum dollar requirement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which will be, at the Borrowers' option, either LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which is subject to adjustment based on the credit ratings of the Company, or a base rate.
     
The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, which are customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on the incurrence of liens and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also includes events of
default, which are customary for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable), including provisions under which, upon the occurrence of an event of default, all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. Also under such provisions, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments will automatically terminate.
     
Certain of the financial institutions that are parties to the Credit Agreement, the 2001 Credit Agreement or the 2005 Credit Agreements provide or have provided a variety of financial services to the Company and its affiliates, including investment banking, cash management, equipment financing and leasing services, the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivative arrangements.
     
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit Agreement, and reference is made to the complete text of the agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1.

In the event there shall occur a change in GAAP which but for the foregoing proviso would affect the computation used to determine compliance with either such covenant, the Borrowers and the Banks agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon an amendment to this Agreement that will permit compliance with such covenant to be determined by reference to GAAP as so changed while affording the Banks the protection afforded by such covenant prior to such change (it being

Section 2.02.
Procedure for Revolving Credit Loans
. (a) A Borrower may borrow Revolving Credit Loans by giving a Revolving Credit Loan Request telephonically, to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:30 A.M., New York time (to be confirmed in writing in substantially the form of Exhibit A not later than 4:00 P.M. on the same day), (i) on the Borrowing Date therefor with respect to any ABR Loan and (ii) at least three Eurodollar Business Days before the Borrowing Date with respect to any Revolving Eurodollar Loan. Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an amount equal to $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (except that such borrowing of ABR Loans may be in the aggregate amount of the unused portion of the Total Commitment).
     
(b) Upon receipt of any Revolving Credit Loan Request from a Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice to each Bank of the substance thereof. Not later than 2:00 P.M., New York time, on the Borrowing Date specified in such Revolving Credit Loan Request, each Bank shall make available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Applicable Lending Office of the Administrative Agent (or, if the Administrative Agent has specified a different address in the notice referred to above, at such address), such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Credit Loans requested.
     
(c) Upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of all such funds, the
Administrative Agent shall disburse to the relevant Borrower on the requested Borrowing Date the Revolving Credit Loans requested in such Revolving Credit Loan Request. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, advance on behalf of any Bank such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Credit Loans on a Borrowing Date unless such Bank shall have notified the Administrative Agent prior to such Borrowing Date that it does not intend to make available its Pro Rata Share of such Revolving Credit Loans on such date. If the Administrative Agent makes
such an advance, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from the Bank on whose behalf such advance was made, and if such Bank does not pay the Administrative Agent the amount of such advance upon demand, the relevant Borrower shall promptly repay such amount to the Administrative Agent, acting for the Banks. Until such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Bank or the relevant Borrower, such advance shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Revolving Credit Loan made by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from the Bank or such Borrower, as the case may be, interest on the amount advanced by it for each day from the Borrowing Date therefor until repaid to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of an amount recovered from any Bank, the Federal Funds Rate or (ii) in the case of an amount recovered from a Borrower, the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable thereto pursuant to Section 3.01. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan to be made by it on any Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on such Borrowing Date, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Bank shall be responsible for the failure by such Bank to make the Loan to be made by such Bank on such Borrowing Date.
     
Section 2.03.
Evidence for Loans
. (a) Each Bank shall maintain, in accordance with its customary and usual practice, accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Bank resulting from each Loan made by such Bank from time to time, including an indication of the Applicable Lending Office and the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank in respect of Loans.
     
(b) The Administrative Agent shall maintain, in accordance with its customary and usual practice, at its address referred to in Section 11.06, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "
Register
") for the recordation of (i) the names of the Borrowers, (ii) the amount of each Loan, whether such Loan is a Revolving Credit Loan or a Competitive Advance Loan, the interest rate options, the Interest Period or Maturity Date (if any) applicable thereto and the Borrower thereof, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Bank hereunder, (iv) the amount of any payments received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from each Borrower and each Bank's share thereof and (v) with respect to each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to the Administrative Agent, the name and address of the Assignee and the principal amount of each Loan owing to such Assignee. The Register shall be available for inspection during ordinary business hours by the Borrowers or any Bank or Assignee from time to time upon reasonable prior notice to the Administrative Agent.
     
(c) The entries made in the Register and the foregoing accounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the indebtedness of each Borrower therein recorded;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of any Bank or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the validity or enforceability of any obligation of a Borrower to repay any Loan actually made to such Borrower by such Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The entries in the Register relating to assignments shall be conclusive, in the absence of clearly demonstrable error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement.
     
(d) A Borrower's obligation to repay any Revolving Credit Loan or Competitive Advance Loan that shall be assigned to a Federal Reserve Bank by a Bank shall, to the extent requested by such Bank in order to effect such assignment, be evidenced by one or more Notes, in substantially the form of Exhibit B-1 (a "
Revolving Credit Note
") or Exhibit B-2 (a "
Competitive
Advance Note
"), as appropriate. A Revolving Credit Note shall be (i) in the principal amount of the Loan or Loans so assigned and (ii) stated to mature on the Termination Date applicable to such Bank and bear interest from its date until paid in full on the principal balance (from time to time outstanding thereunder) payable at the rates and in the manner provided herein. A Competitive Advance Note shall be (i) in the principal amount of the Competitive Advance Loan made by such Bank and so assigned, (ii) stated to mature on the Maturity Date for such Competitive Advance Loan and bear interest from its date until paid in full on the principal balance (from time to time outstanding thereunder) payable at the rates and in the manner provided herein and (iii) not prepayable by the Borrower.
     
Section 2.04.
Increase of Commitment
. API may from time to time, by notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Banks), request that the Total Commitment be increased by $10,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof and will not result in the Total Commitment exceeding $1,250,000,000. Each such notice shall set forth the requested amount of the increase in the Total Commitment and the date on which such increase is to become effective (which shall be not fewer than twenty days after the date of such notice), and shall offer each Bank the opportunity to increase its Commitment by its ratable share, based on the amounts of the Banks' Commitments on the date of such notice, of the requested increase in the Total Commitment. Each Bank shall, by notice to API and the Administrative Agent given not more than ten Business Days after the date of API's notice, either agree to increase its Commitment by all or a portion of the offered amount or decline to increase its Commitment (and any Bank that does not deliver such a notice within such period of ten Business Days shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment). In the event that, on the tenth Domestic Business Day after API shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph, the Banks shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the Total Commitment requested by API, API shall have the right to arrange for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other financial institution being called an "
Augmenting Bank
"), which may include any Bank, to extend Commitments or increase their existing Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount, provided that each Augmenting Bank, if not already a Bank hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall specify to evidence its status as a Bank hereunder. If (and only if) Banks (including Augmenting Banks) shall have agreed to increase their Commitments or to extend new Commitments in an aggregate amount not less than $10,000,000, such increases and such new Commitments shall become effective on the date specified in the notice delivered by API pursuant to the first sentence of this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Total Commitment (or in the Commitment of any Bank) shall become effective under this paragraph unless, on the date of such increase, (i) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 6.02 (including the condition set forth in Section 6.02(c) insofar as it relates to representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.01(d)(ii) and 5.01(e) which are otherwise excluded in Section 6.02) shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such
date and executed by a Responsible Officer of API or (ii) the Banks shall have waived the requirements set forth in clause (i) of this sentence.
     
Section 2.05.
Reduction of Commitments
. API shall have the right, upon not less than three Domestic Business Days' telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) from API to the Administrative Agent and, if the Total Commitment is thereby to be reduced to zero, upon payment of the Facility Fee accrued to (but excluding) the date of such reduction, to reduce the Total Commitment in full or in part;
provided
,
however
, that the amount of any reduction in the Total Commitment may not exceed the Available Facility (after giving effect to any Loans being repaid or prepaid on the day of such reduction and any Loans to be made on such day). Partial reductions of the Total Commitment shall be in the amount of $10,000,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if the Available Facility is less than $10,000,000, then all of such lesser amount). Subject to Section 2.04, all reductions of the Total Commitment shall be permanent.
     
Section 2.06.
Prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans
. A Borrower shall have the right, by giving telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent by not later than 10:30 A.M., New York time, (i) on the day of prepayment in the case of ABR Loans and (ii) on the third Eurodollar Business Day prior to the day of prepayment in the case of Revolving Eurodollar Loans, to prepay Revolving Credit Loans of such Borrower bearing interest on the same basis and having the same Interest Period, if any, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, in the aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such Revolving Credit Loan is less than $10,000,000, then all of such lesser amount), together with accrued interest (except for ABR Loans, as to which such interest shall be paid on the next date when it otherwise would be payable under 3.02) on the principal being prepaid to (but excluding) the date of prepayment and, in the case of Revolving Eurodollar Loans, the amounts required by Section 4.03. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Revolving Credit Loans so prepaid may be reborrowed by any Borrower.

Each Bank may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and a Borrower may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers, in the manner set forth in this Section 2.07.
     
(b) A Borrower may request Competitive Advance Loans under this Section 2.07 by a Competitive Advance Loan Request, in substantially the form of Exhibit C-2, given to the Administrative Agent not later than the Competitive Advance Notice Time therefor. The Competitive Advance Loan Request shall indicate whether the solicitation of Competitive Advance
Bids shall be conducted by the Administrative Agent in New York or in London. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank, by a letter in substantially the form of Exhibit C-3, of each Competitive Advance Loan Request received by it from a Borrower and of the terms contained therein.
     
(c) Each Bank may, if it elects so to do, irrevocably offer to make a Competitive Advance Loan of the requested type to the requesting Borrower at a Competitive Advance Bid Rate or Rates, as specified by such Bank in accordance with the related Competitive Advance Loan Request, by submitting to the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to such Borrower) a Competitive Advance Bid, in substantially the form of Exhibit C-4, before the Competitive Advance Bid Deadline, of the maximum and minimum principal amounts of the Competitive Advance Loan which such Bank would be willing to make (which amount may, subject to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.07(a), exceed such Bank's Commitment, but shall be in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), the rate or rates of interest therefor or the applicable margin over LIBOR for the relevant Interest Period, as the case may be, and any other terms and conditions required by such Bank. If any Bank shall fail to submit a Competitive Advance Bid to the Administrative Agent before the Competitive Advance Bid Deadline, then such Bank shall be deemed to have elected not to make an offer to make a Competitive Advance Loan. If a Bank submits a Competitive Advance Bid pursuant to this Section 2.07 specifying that such Bank is waiving the right to claim compensation under Section 3.03(c), 4.04(a) or 4.04(b), such Bank shall be deemed to have waived the right to claim such compensation under such Section 3.03(c), 4.04(a) or 4.04(b) in connection with any Competitive Advance Loan or Loans thereafter made by such Bank pursuant to such Competitive Advance Bid; and the Borrower shall be entitled to make a reasonable determination that a Competitive Advance Bid in which a Bank has waived the right to any such compensation is made at a Competitive Advance Bid Rate lower than an otherwise identical or lower Competitive Advance Bid including no such waiver. The Administrative Agent shall (i) disclose the Competitive Advance Bids received to the relevant Borrower as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Bid Deadline, (ii) maintain all Competitive Advance Bids in confidence until each of them has been disclosed to such Borrower and (iii) provide copies of all Competitive Advance Bids to the relevant Borrower as soon as practicable after completion of the bidding process set forth in this Section 2.07.
     
(d) A Borrower that made a Competitive Advance Loan Request shall, before the Competitive Advance Accept/ Reject Deadline, either
     
(i) cancel the Competitive Advance Loan Request by giving the Administrative Agent notice to that effect, or
     
(ii) accept one or more Competitive Advance Bids, in its sole discretion, by giving notice in substantially the form of Exhibit C-5 (a "
Competitive Advance
Accept/Reject Notice
") to the Administrative Agent of the principal amount of each Competitive Advance Loan (which principal amount shall be equal to or greater than the minimum amount offered by such Bank and equal to or less than the maximum amount offered by such Bank for such Competitive Advance Loan pursuant to Section 2.07(c)) to be made by the Bank or Banks that made such Competitive Advance Bid or Bids, and reject any remaining Competitive Advance Bids, by giving the Administrative Agent notice to
that effect;
provided
that the aggregate principal amount of such Competitive Advance Bids accepted by such Borrower shall be in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and provided further that (A) the failure by such Borrower to give such notice in a timely fashion shall be deemed to be a rejection of all Competitive Advance Bids, (B) such Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Advance Bid made at a Competitive Advance Bid Rate if such Borrower has rejected a Competitive Advance Bid made at a lower Competitive Advance Bid Rate, (C) the aggregate principal amount of the Competitive Advance Bids accepted by such Borrower shall not exceed the principal amount specified in the related Competitive Advance Loan Request, (D) if such Borrower shall accept a Competitive Advance Bid made at a particular Competitive Advance Bid Rate but the amount of such Competitive Advance Bid shall cause the total amount of Competitive Advance Bids accepted by the Borrower to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive Advance Loan Request, then such Borrower shall (notwithstanding the minimum bid acceptance amount required by clause (F) below) accept a portion of such Competitive Advance Bid in an amount equal to the amount specified in the Competitive Advance Loan Request less the amount of all other Competitive Advance Bids accepted with respect to such Competitive Advance Loan Request, (E) if such Borrower shall accept Competitive Advance Bids made at a particular Competitive Advance Bid Rate but shall be restricted by other conditions hereof from borrowing the principal amount of Competitive Advance Loans specified in such Competitive Advance Loan Request in respect of which Competitive Advance Bids at such Competitive Advance Bid Rate have been made or if such Borrower shall accept Competitive Advance Bids made at a particular Competitive Advance Bid Rate but the aggregate amount of Competitive Advance Bids made at such Competitive Advance Bid Rate shall exceed the amount specified in the Competitive Advance Loan Request, then such Borrower shall accept a pro rata portion of each Competitive Advance Bid made at such Competitive Advance Bid Rate aggregating the portion of Competitive Advance Loans with respect to which Competitive Advance Bids at such Competitive Advance Bid Rate have been received (provided further that if the principal amount of Competitive Advance Loans to be so allocated is not sufficient to enable Competitive Advance Loans to be so allocated to each such Bank in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof such Borrower shall select the Banks to be allocated such Competitive Advance Loans in a principal amount equal to not less than $5,000,000 but may round up allocations to the next higher integral multiple of $1,000,000 if necessary) and (F) except as provided in clauses (D) and (E) above, no Competitive Advance Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Advance Loan unless such Competitive Advance Loan is in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
     
(e) If the Borrower that made a Competitive Advance Loan Request notifies the Administrative Agent that such Competitive Advance Loan Request is cancelled in accordance with Section 2.07(d)(i), the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks.
     
(f) If the Borrower that made a Competitive Advance Loan Request accepts one or more Competitive Advance Bids, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice (i) to each Bank that submitted a Competitive Advance Bid of the date and aggregate amount of such Competitive Advance Loan(s) and whether or not any Competitive Advance Bid made by such Bank has been accepted by the Borrower, (ii) to each Bank whose Competitive Advance Bid, or
any portion thereof, has been accepted by the Borrower, of the amount of the Competitive Advance Loan to be made by such Bank and the date for repayment thereof, together with the Competitive Advance Rate or Competitive Advance Margin, as applicable, and any other terms applicable to such Competitive Advance Loan and (iii) to each Bank of the principal amounts and Competitive Advance Bid Rates specified in each of the Competitive Advance Bids submitted in response to the related Competitive Advance Loan Request.
     
(g) Following any acceptance by the Borrower and notification by the Administrative Agent pursuant to clause (f) above, and upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent contained in Article 6 applicable thereto, each such Bank shall disburse to such Borrower on the specified Borrowing Date Competitive Advance Loans in the aggregate amount accepted by such Borrower, in the manner and subject to the same terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.02(c) with respect to ABR Loans,
mutatis mutandis
.
     
(h) Nothing in this Section 2.07 shall be construed as a right of first offer in favor of the Banks or to otherwise limit the ability of a Borrower to request and accept credit facilities from any Person (including any Bank).

The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans will be used for general corporate purposes, which shall include the use thereof, directly or indirectly, for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of funding or making payments on account of the purchase or redemption by API of any shares of capital stock of API or any related option, warrant or similar right.
     
Section 2.09.
Extension of Termination Date
. (a) At least 45 days but not more than 60 days prior to the first and/or second anniversary of the Effective Date, API, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, may request an extension of the Termination Date in effect at such time by one year from its then scheduled expiration. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of such request, and each Bank shall in turn, in its sole discretion, not later than 20 days prior to the applicable anniversary date, notify API and the Administrative Agent in writing as to whether such Bank will consent to such extension. If any Bank shall fail to notify the Administrative Agent and API in writing of its consent to any such request for extension of the Termination Date at least 20 days prior to the applicable anniversary date, such Bank shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Bank with respect to such request for an extension of the Termination Date.
     
(b) If all the Banks consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.09, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the applicable anniversary of the Effective Date (an "
Extension Date
"), be extended for one year, subject to subsection (e) of this Section 2.09. If less than all of the Banks consent in writing to any such request in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.09, the Termination Date in effect at such time shall not be extended as to any Bank that has not so consented (each a "
Non-Extending Bank
"). To the extent that the Termination Date is not extended as to any Bank pursuant to this Section 2.09 and the Commitment of such Bank is not assumed in accordance with subsection (c) of this Section 2.09 on or prior to the applicable Extension Date, the Commitment of such Non-Extending Bank shall automatically terminate in whole on such unextended Termination Date without any further notice or other action by API, such Bank or any other Person. It is understood
and agreed that no Bank shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by API for any extension of the Termination Date.
     
(c) If less than all of the Banks consent to any such request pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 2.09, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Extending Banks, and each Extending Bank may, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Administrative Agent not later than 10 days prior to the applicable Extension Date of the amount of the Non-Extending Banks' Commitments for which it is willing to accept an assignment. If the Extending Banks notify the Administrative Agent that they are willing to accept assignments of Commitments in an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of the Commitments of the Non-Extending Banks, such Commitments shall be allocated among the Extending Banks willing to accept such assignments in such amounts as are agreed between API and the Administrative Agent. If after giving effect to the assignments of Commitments described above there remains any Commitments of Non-Extending Banks, API may arrange for one or more Extending Banks or other banks or financial institutions (each, an "
Assuming Bank
") to assume, effective as of the Extension Date, any Non-Extending Bank's Commitment and all of the obligations of such Non-Extending Bank under this Agreement thereafter arising, without recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Non-Extending Bank;
provided
,
however
, that the amount of the Commitment of any such Assuming Bank as a result of such substitution shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 unless the amount of the Commitment of such Non-Extending Bank is less than $10,000,000, in which case such Assuming Bank shall assume all of such lesser amount; and
provided further
that:
     
(i) any such Assuming Bank shall have paid to such Non-Extending Bank (A) the aggregate principal amount of, and any interest accrued and unpaid to the effective date of the assignment on, the outstanding Advances, if any, of such Non-Extending Bank
plus
(B) any accrued but unpaid Facility Fees and Utilization Fees owing to such Non-Extending Bank as of the effective date of such assignment;
     
(ii) all additional costs reimbursements, expense reimbursements and indemnities payable to such Non-Extending Bank, and all other accrued and unpaid amounts owing to such Non-Extending Bank hereunder, as of the effective date of such assignment shall have been paid to such Non-Extending Bank; and
     
(iii) with respect to any such Assuming Bank, the applicable processing and recordation fee required under Section 11.08(c) for such assignment shall have been paid.
At least three Business Days prior to the effective date of any such assignment, (A) each such Assuming Bank shall have delivered confirmation in writing satisfactory to API and the Administrative Agent as to the amount of its Commitment and (B) each Non-Extending Bank being replaced pursuant to this Section 2.09 shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent any Note or Notes held by such Non-Extending Bank. Upon the payment or prepayment of all amounts referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, each such Assuming Bank, as of the Extension Date, will be substituted for such Non-Extending Bank under this Agreement and shall be a Bank for all purposes of this Agreement, without any further acknowledgment by or the consent of the other Banks, and the obligations of each such Non-Extending Bank hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof, be released and discharged.
     
(d) If (after giving effect to any assignments or assumptions pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section 2.09) Banks having Commitments equal to at least 50% of the Commitments in effect immediately prior to the applicable Extension Date consent in writing to a requested extension not later than one Business Day prior to such Extension Date, the Administrative Agent shall so notify API, and, subject to subsection (e) of this Section 2.09, the Termination Date then in effect shall be extended for the additional one-year period in respect of all Extending Banks and Assuming Banks that become parties hereto pursuant to an assignment from a Non-Extending Bank as described in subsection (c) of this Section 2.09, and all references in this Agreement, and in the Notes, if any, to the "
Termination Date
" shall, with respect to each Extending Bank and each such Assuming Bank, refer to the Termination Date as so extended. Promptly following each Extension Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Banks (including, without limitation, each Assuming Bank) of the extension of the scheduled Termination Date in effect immediately prior thereto and shall thereupon record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each such Extending Bank and each such Assuming Bank. If the Termination Date is extended as provided in this paragraph (d), any Non-Extending Bank, and any assignee of a Non-Extending Bank, may become an Extending Bank by giving notice to that effect to the Administrative Agent indicating its intention to extend its Commitment to the Termination Date as so extended.
     
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Termination Date shall become effective under this Section 2.09 unless, on the applicable Extension Date, (i) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 6.02 (including the condition set forth in Section 6.02(c) insofar as it relates to representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.01(d)(ii) and 5.01(e) which are otherwise excluded in Section 6.02) shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Responsible Officer of API or (ii) the Banks shall have waived the requirements set forth in clause (i) of this sentence.

(b) The Interest Period for each Revolving Eurodollar Loan shall be selected by the relevant Borrower at least three Eurodollar Business Days prior to the beginning of such Interest Period. If such Borrower fails to notify the Administrative Agent of the Interest Period for a subsequent Revolving Eurodollar Loan at least three Eurodollar Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period of an outstanding Revolving Eurodollar Loan, then such outstanding Revolving Eurodollar Loan shall become an ABR Loan at the end of such current Interest Period.
     
(c) For so long as any Bank maintains reserves against "Eurocurrency Liabilities" pursuant to Regulation D of the Federal Reserve Board (or any successor regulation), each Borrower shall, subject to the two next succeeding sentences, contemporaneously with the related interest payments, pay additional interest on each Eurodollar Loan of such Bank at a rate per annum up to but not exceeding the excess of (i) (A) LIBOR divided by (B) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) LIBOR. Each Bank shall promptly notify API, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, upon becoming aware that any Borrower may be required to make a payment pursuant to this Section 3.03(c) . When requesting payment pursuant to this Section 3.03(c), each Bank shall provide to API, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a certificate, signed by an officer of such Bank, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis of such claim, the amount required to be paid by the Borrower to such Bank and the computations made by such Bank to determine such amount.

. Each Competitive Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest from the date of such Competitive Absolute Rate Loan to (but excluding) its Maturity Date, payable in arrears on the date such Loan is repaid, at a rate per annum (on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days involved) equal to the Competitive Advance Rate applicable to such Competitive Absolute Rate Loan.

(i) all the outstanding ABR Loans of such Borrower, or a portion thereof in an aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, be converted into a Revolving Eurodollar Loan on the requested Conversion Date; or

Section 3.07.
Maximum Interest Rate
. (a) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall require a Borrower to pay interest at a rate exceeding the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

(b) If the amount of interest payable by a Borrower for the account of any Bank on any interest payment date in respect of the immediately preceding interest computation period, computed pursuant to this Article III, would exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Bank, the amount of interest payable for its account on such interest payment date shall automatically be reduced to such maximum permissible amount.

(b) The Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree to pay, in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks, a fee (the "
Utilization
Fee
") for each day during the quarterly period (or shorter period commencing on the Effective Date or ending on the Final Termination Date) ending on the Business Day immediately preceding such Fee Payment Date on which the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans exceeds 50% of the Total Commitment on such day computed by applying the applicable percentages per annum set forth below based on the ratings on such day of API's senior unsecured long-term debt (each range of ratings listed under any Level being inclusive of the ratings so listed) to the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding on such day:
     
(c) For purposes of Sections 3.08(a) and 3.08(b), (i) if no rating for API's senior unsecured long-term debt shall be available from either rating agency, such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a Level V rating, (ii) if the ratings established or deemed established by Moody's and S&P shall fall within different Levels, the Facility Fee and Utilization Fee shall be based upon the Level corresponding to the more favorable of such ratings except if the lower of such ratings is more than one Level below the higher of such ratings, the Facility Fee and Utilization Fee shall be based upon the Level that is one Level below the higher of such ratings and (iii) if any rating established or deemed established by Moody's or S&P shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of either Moody's or S&P), such change shall be given effect on and as of the opening of business on the date when such change is first announced by the rating agency making such change. If the rating system of either Moody's or S&P shall change prior to the Final Termination Date, API and the Banks shall negotiate in good faith to amend the references to specific ratings in this Section 3.08 to reflect such changed rating system.
     
(d) Each of the Facility Fee and Utilization Fee shall be computed based on a 365-day year (366 days in the case of a leap year), for the actual number of days involved.

(c) Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, ABR Loans or Competitive Absolute Rate Loans, or fees shall be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, Eurodollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Eurodollar Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Eurodollar Business Day unless such Eurodollar Business Day falls in another calendar

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the relevant Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, but shall not be obligated to, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

any margin included therein) over (ii) the amount of interest (as determined in good faith by such Bank) that would have accrued to such Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the relevant interbank market.

Section 4.04.
Withholding, Reserves and Additional Costs

Taxes
"). If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amount payable by a Borrower under this Agreement, then the amount so payable under this Agreement shall be increased to the amount which, after deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be withheld or deducted therefrom (the amount of such increase, an "
Additional
Amount
"), will yield to such Bank the amount stated to be payable under this Agreement. The relevant Borrower shall execute and deliver to any Bank upon its request such further instruments as may be necessary or desirable to give full force and effect to any such increase. The relevant Borrower shall also hold each Bank harmless and indemnify it for any stamp or other taxes with respect to the preparation, execution, delivery, recording, performance or enforcement of the Credit Documents (all of which shall be included within "Taxes"). If any of the Taxes specified in this Section 4.04(a) are paid by a Bank, the relevant Borrower shall, upon demand of such Bank, promptly reimburse such Bank for such payments, together with any interest, penalties and expenses incurred in connection herewith. Each Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for all Taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by such Borrower hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrowers shall be entitled, to the extent required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold (and shall not be required to make payments as otherwise required by this Section 4.04 on account of such deductions or withholdings) income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States of America from interest, fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Bank other than a Bank (i) that is a U.S. Person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) that has the Prescribed
Forms on file with the Borrowers for the applicable year to the extent deduction or withholding of such taxes is not required as a result of such filing of such Prescribed Forms (unless the failure to leave such forms on file results from a change in law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or administrative or Governmental Authority charged with the administration thereof subsequent to the date hereof);
provided
that if a Borrower shall so deduct or withhold any such taxes, such Borrower shall provide a statement to the Administrative Agent and such Bank, setting forth the amount of such taxes so deducted or withheld, the applicable rate and any other information or documentation which such Bank may reasonably request for assisting such Bank to obtain any allowable credits or deductions for the taxes so deducted or withheld in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which such Bank is subject to tax.
     
(ii) If any Bank has received or been granted a credit against or relief or remission for, or refund or repayment of, any Tax paid or payable by it in respect of or which takes account of any Tax with respect to which an Additional Amount was paid by a Borrower (an "
Indemnified Tax
") or other matter giving rise to such payment, such Bank shall, to the extent it determines in good faith that it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission, refund or repayment, pay to such Borrower such amount as such Bank shall determine in good faith to be attributable to such Indemnified Tax or other matter and which will leave such Bank (after such payment to the Borrower) in a position no better or worse than it would have been in had such Borrower not been required to deduct or withhold such Indemnified Tax or such other matter had not arisen;
provided
that such Borrower upon the written request of such Bank, shall return to such Bank the amount of any such refund, repayment or benefit of credit in the event that such Bank is required to repay such amount to the relevant Governmental Authority.

Additional Costs
") to such Bank of maintaining its Commitment to make Revolving Eurodollar Loans or making or maintaining its Revolving Eurodollar Loans or (subject to Section 2.07(c)) Competitive Eurodollar Loans or shall reduce the amounts received or receivable hereunder (which Additional Costs shall be calculated by such Bank in good faith in accordance with each Bank's internal policies, including any reasonable averaging and attribution methods) by an amount which such Bank in good faith shall determine to be material, then, subject to Sections 4.04(c) and (d), the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Bank an amount equal to such Additional Costs.
     
(ii) Without duplication of any amounts described in Section 3.03(c), 4.04(a) or 4.04(b)(i), if after the date hereof the adoption of any applicable law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency or instrumentality charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by such Bank with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency or instrumentality, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital for such Bank or any corporation controlling such Bank as a consequence of its obligations under this Agreement to a level below that which such Bank shall determine in good faith that reasonably could have been achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, subject to Sections 4.04(c) and (d), the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for such reduction.
     
(c)
Mitigation
. If, with respect to a Bank, a condition arises or an event occurs after the date hereof that would, or would upon the giving of notice, result in the payment of any Additional Costs or Additional Amounts pursuant to this Section 4.04 or the delivery by such Bank of any notice described in the first sentence of Section 4.05, then such Bank, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, shall notify API (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) thereof and at API's request shall take such steps as may be available to it and acceptable to the Borrowers to mitigate the effects of such condition or event (which shall include efforts consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions applicable to it to book the Loans held by such Bank hereunder at another lending office of such Bank if such other lending office is not, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank);
provided
that such Bank shall be under no obligation to take any step that, in its good faith judgment, would result in its incurring any Additional Costs, additional Taxes or other additional costs in performing its obligations hereunder (unless the Borrower has agreed to reimburse it for the same) or would, in the good faith judgment of such Bank, be materially disadvantageous to such Bank.
     
(d)

The Agency

Administrative Agent hereunder and irrevocably authorizes Citibank, N.A. to take such action on its behalf and to exercise such powers hereunder as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental hereto, including the exercise by the Administrative Agent of powers delegated to the Administrative Agent and the Banks hereby, and Citibank, N.A. hereby accepts such appointment subject to the terms hereof. The relationship between the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall be that of agent and principal only and nothing herein shall be construed to constitute the Administrative Agent a trustee for any Bank nor to impose on the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein.
     
Section 9.02.
The Administrative Agent's Duties
. The Administrative Agent shall promptly forward to each Bank copies, or notify each Bank as to the contents, of all notices and other communications received from a Borrower pursuant to the Credit Documents. As to any other matter not expressly provided for herein or therein, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to act or refrain from acting with respect to a Borrower, except upon the written instructions of the Required Banks. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have received from the payee of such Note written notice of the transfer thereof. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Banks and, except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, such instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Banks and each subsequent holder of any Loan. The Administrative Agent shall not be bound by any waiver, amendment, supplement, or modification of any Credit Document which affects its duties as Administrative Agent, unless it shall have given its prior written consent thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements binding upon a Borrower pursuant to any Credit Document, nor shall it be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless it shall have received written notice from a Borrower or a Bank specifying such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
     
Section 9.03.
Sharing of Payments and Expenses
. All funds for the account of the Banks received by the Administrative Agent in respect of payments made by a Borrower pursuant to, or from any Person on account of, any Credit Document shall be distributed forthwith by the Administrative Agent among the Banks, ratably in proportion to their respective interests therein. In the event that any Bank shall receive from a Borrower or any other source any payment of, on account of, or for or under any Credit Document (whether received pursuant to the exercise of any right of set-off, banker's lien, realization upon any security held for or appropriated to such obligation or otherwise as permitted by law) other than in proportion to its Pro Rata Share, except for amounts payable to such Bank under Section 4.03, 4.04, 4.06 or 4.07 hereof, then such Bank shall purchase at par from each other Bank so much of its interest in obligations of the Borrowers as shall be necessary in order that each Bank shall share such payment with each of the other Banks in proportion to each Bank's Pro Rata Share. In the event that any purchasing Bank shall be
required to return any excess payment received by it, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such return, but without interest.
     
Section 9.04.
The Administrative Agent's Liabilities

Each of the Banks and the Borrowers agrees that (a) neither the Administrative Agent in such capacity nor any of its officers or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them hereunder except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) neither the Administrative Agent in such capacity nor any of its officers or employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in good faith in reliance upon the advice of counsel, independent public accountants or other experts selected by the Administrative Agent and (c) the Administrative Agent in such capacity shall be entitled to rely upon any notice (telephonic or written), consent, certificate, statement or other document (including any telegram, cable, telex, facsimile or telephone transmission) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been given, signed and/or sent by the proper Persons.
     
Section 9.05.
The Administrative Agent as a Bank
. The Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent, and the terms "Bank" or "Banks", unless the context otherwise indicated, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The
Administrative Agent may maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking business with API or any Subsidiary or affiliate of API as if it were any other Bank and without any duty to account therefor to the other Banks.
     
Section 9.06.
Bank Credit Decision
. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers or employees has any responsibility for, gives any guaranty in respect of, nor makes any representation to the Banks as to, (a) the condition, financial or otherwise, of API or any Subsidiary thereof or the truth of any representation or warranty given or made in, or in connection with, any Credit Document or (b) the validity, execution, sufficiency, effectiveness, construction, adequacy, enforceability or value of any Credit Document or any related document or instrument. Except as specifically provided herein and in the other Credit Documents to which the Administrative Agent is a party, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Bank with any credit or other information with respect to the operations, business, property, condition or creditworthiness of the Borrowers, whether such information comes into the Administrative Agent's possession on or before the date hereof or at any time thereafter. Each Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based upon such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and any other Credit Documents to which it may become a party. Each Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, and based upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under any Credit Document.
     
Section 9.07.
Indemnification
. Each Bank agrees (which agreement shall survive repayment of the Loans) to indemnify the Administrative Agent, to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers, ratably in accordance with its respective Commitment in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitment shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in
accordance with its respective Commitment immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, claims, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of any Credit Document, or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent under any Credit Document;
provided
that no Bank shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees. Without limiting the foregoing, each Bank agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Administrative Agent in such capacity in connection with the enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, any Credit Document or any amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers.
     
Section 9.08.
Successor Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Banks and API, and the Administrative Agent may be removed at any time by the Required Banks by giving written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, the other Banks and API at least 10 Business Days prior to the effective date of such removal. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks, with the prior written consent of API (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof and having a capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000 (a "
Qualified Administrative Agent
"). If no such successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, or the Required Banks' giving notice of removal, as the case may be, the resigning or removed Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Qualified Administrative Agent as set forth in this Section 9.08. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigned or removed Administrative Agent, and the resigned or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations in such capacity under this Agreement and any other Credit Documents. After any Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.
     
Section 10.01.
The Guaranty
. API unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the prompt payment when due of all present and future obligations and liabilities of all kinds (including post-petition interest, whether or not such interest constitutes an allowed claim in the related bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding) of each other Borrower to the Banks under any Credit
Document, whether incurred by such Borrower as maker, endorser, drawer, acceptor, guarantor, accommodation party or otherwise, and whether due or to become due, secured or unsecured, absolute or contingent, joint or several, and howsoever or whenever incurred by such Borrower (the "
Guaranteed Obligations
").
     
Section 10.02.
Absolute Guaranty
. API's obligations hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations (b) the existence, legality, validity, enforceability (including as a result of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding), perfection, or extent of any collateral therefor, (c) any change in the corporate existence or structure of any other Borrower, (d) any claims or set-offs that API may have, (e) any law, regulation, decree or order of any jurisdiction or any event affecting any term of the Guaranteed Obligations or the rights of any Bank with respect thereto or (f) any other circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations or the Borrowers (other than API) which might otherwise constitute a defense available to any surety or guarantor or to this Guaranty. The Banks make no representation or warranty in respect of any such circumstance and have no duty or responsibility whatsoever to API with respect to the management or maintenance of the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral therefor. The Banks shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that a Borrower becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Banks so to file shall not affect API's obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Banks in respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, API shall remain liable hereunder in respect of such Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.
     
Section 10.03.
Consents, Waivers and Renewals
. API agrees that the Banks may at any time and from time to time, either before or after the maturity thereof, without notice to or further consent of API, extend the time of payment of, exchange or surrender any collateral for, or renew any Guaranteed Obligations, and may also make any agreement with ACC, an Additional Borrower or with any other party to or person liable on any Guaranteed Obligations, or interested therein, for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Banks, ACC, an Additional Borrower or any such other party or person, without in any way impairing or affecting this Guaranty. API agrees that the Banks may resort to API for payment of any Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not the Banks shall have resorted to any collateral security, or shall have proceeded against any Borrower or other obligor principally or secondarily obligated with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations.
     
Section 10.04.
Subrogation
. API will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation or by any indemnity, reimbursement or other agreement, and shall not exercise any right of recourse to any assets or property of any other Borrower held for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments have been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to API in violation of the preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Banks and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
     
Section 10.05.
Security
. Without limiting any other right of each Bank, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, whenever any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall become due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), such Bank at its sole election may set off against the Guaranteed Obligations due to such Bank all moneys then standing to the credit of API on the books of such Bank. Any Bank exercising its rights under this Section 10.05 shall give notice thereof to API, the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent concurrently with or prior to the exercise of such rights, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
     
Section 10.06.
Continuing Guaranty
. API's obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until the principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by any other Borrower under this Agreement shall have been paid in full. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on the Loans or any other amount payable by any such Borrower under this Agreement is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Borrower or otherwise, API's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though such payment had been due but not made at such time.
     
Section 10.07.
Waiver of Notice
. API waives notice of the acceptance of this Guaranty and of the making of any loans or extensions of credit to any other Borrower, presentment to or demand or payment from anyone whomsoever liable upon any of the Guaranteed Obligations, presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, notice of any sale of collateral security and all other notices whatsoever.

The rights of each Bank under this Section 11.02 are in addition to any other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have. Any Bank exercising its rights under this Section 11.02 shall give notice thereof to API, the relevant Borrower and the Administrative Agent concurrently with or prior to the exercise of such rights, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
     
Section 11.03.
Expenses
. API agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and any Banks, including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one firm of counsel (plus one firm of local counsel in any relevant jurisdiction to the extent necessary or appropriate in connection with any proceeding relating to enforcement) chosen from time to time to represent the Banks as a group in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Credit Documents and, if necessary, in connection with the administration and enforcement of any provisions of the Credit Documents.
     
Section 11.04.
Amendments
. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, but only if, such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and is signed by each of the Borrowers and the Required Banks (and, if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent are affected thereby, by the Administrative Agent);

Section 11.05.
Cumulative Rights and No Waiver
. Each and every right granted to the Administrative Agent and the Banks under any Credit Document, or allowed them by law or equity, shall be cumulative and may be exercised from time to time. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Bank of any right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

. (a)
Successors and Assigns
. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the Borrowers and the Banks and their respective successors. Except as permitted in Section 11.08(c), no interest in the Commitment of any Bank or any Loan, nor any right of a Bank under the Credit Documents, may be assigned to any Person that was not, prior to such assignment, a Bank hereunder. No Borrower shall assign or delegate any of its respective rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of all the Banks. Any purported assignment in contravention of this Section 11.08 shall be null and void.
     
(b) . Any Bank, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, may at any time grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, a "") participating interests in its Commitment or any or all of its Revolving Credit Loans; that such Bank gives written notice of the granting of such participation to API. In the event of any such grant by a Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to either Borrower and the Administrative Agent, such Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any Bank may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Documents, including the right to approve any amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; that such participation agreement may provide that such Bank will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of this Agreement described in Sections 11.04(i) through (v), inclusive, without the consent of the Participant. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.03 and 4.04 with respect to its participating interest; that (i) all amounts payable to a Bank for the account of a Participant under Sections 4.03 and 4.04 shall be determined as if such Bank had not granted such participation to the Participant and (ii) no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 4.03 or 4.04 than such Bank would have been entitled to receive

(c)
Assignments
. (i) Any Bank, in accordance with applicable law, may assign all or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including a portion or all of its Commitment or of the Loans at the time owing to it) to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, an "
Assignee
");
provided

Assignment and Acceptance
"), and the assigning Bank or the Assignee shall pay to the Administrative Agent an assignment fee in cash equal to $1,000 (if the Assignee is already a Bank) or $3,500 (otherwise), and (D) as of the date of such assignment, except with the prior written consent of API and the Administrative Agent, (1) the Assignee shall not have any right, and shall have no knowledge that such assignment would result in its having the right, to request compensation pursuant to Section 4.04 after giving effect to such assignment and (2) the parties to such assignment shall have no knowledge that such assignment (a) would cause it to be unlawful for any party thereto to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan or (b) would cause any Borrower to incur any liability under Section 4.03 or 4.04. Upon acceptance and recording in the Register, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least two Domestic Business Days after the execution thereof, (A) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the Commitment assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of, and shall for all purposes be, a Bank under this Agreement and (B) the assigning Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the Commitment assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from such Commitment (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Bank's Commitment under this Agreement and in the case of an assignment pursuant to Section 4.06, such Bank shall cease to be a party hereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any Bank assigning any portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement may retain any Competitive Advance Loans made by it outstanding at such time and, in such case, shall retain its rights hereunder in respect of any Competitive Advance Loans so retained until such Loans have been repaid and (B) any Bank may at any time assign or grant a security interest in its Loans and its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Assignee shall not, by virtue of an Assignment and Acceptance, become a party to this Agreement or a "Bank", or have any rights to consent to or refrain from consenting to any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Credit Document unless such Assignee shall thereby have accepted a Commitment hereunder; that no such amendment, waiver or modification may reduce or postpone any payment of principal or interest in respect of any Loan assigned to such Assignee thereby without the written consent of such Assignee.
provided

By executing and delivering this Agreement, each Bank hereby confirms that it is not such a "broker", "dealer" or "creditor".

Indemnity
. The Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each of the Banks and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and controlling persons (each such Person, an "
Indemnitee
") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees and expenses, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto;

resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Indemnitee. In no event, however, shall any Indemnitee be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings).

Section 11.13.
Judgment
. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the obligation of any Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in Dollars to any Bank or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase Dollars with such other currency; if the amount of Dollars so purchased is less than such sum due to such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in Dollars, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment,
to indemnify such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of Dollars so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in Dollars, such Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit to such Borrower such excess.
     
Section 11.14.
