ITEM: Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On November 15, 2005, Avon Products, Inc. (the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the November 15, 2005 Form 8-K) regarding its multi-year restructuring initiatives and indicated that restructuring charges and other costs to implement those initiatives over the next several years are expected to total $300 to $500 million before taxes, with a significant portion to be incurred in 2006. At that time, the Company was unable in good faith to make a determination of the estimated amount or ranges of amounts to be incurred for each major type of cost and the charges and future cash expenditures associated therewith, as required by Item 2.05 of Form 8-K. In the November 15, 2005 Form 8-K, the Company undertook to announce further details as initiatives are finalized.
The Company is filing this Form 8-K/A to amend the November 15, 2005 Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein under Item 2.05. On January 20, 2006 and January 26, 2006, a committee of the Board of Directors, as authorized by the Board, approved the termination of certain employees, as part of the previously announced multi-year restructuring effort. The Company will record a charge (which will result in future cash expenditures) of approximately $14 million before taxes in its results for the fourth quarter of 2005 for employee related costs. This amount is in addition to the previously disclosed amount of approximately $35 million to $40 million being recorded in the Company's fourth quarter results for previously disclosed initiatives that were described in the Company's filing on Form 8-K/A filed on January 4, 2006.
The Company expects to announce further exit and disposal costs in subsequent periods. As stated in the November 15, 2005 Form 8-K, the Company intends to file amendments to the report once it is able to make good faith determinations of the estimated costs and future cash expenditures associated with its multi-year restructuring initiatives, as required by Item 2.05 of Form 8-K.
    
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
