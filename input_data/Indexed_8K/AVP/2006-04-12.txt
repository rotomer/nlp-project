Item 8.01 Other Events.
As reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 7, 2005, Avon Products, Inc., effective January 1, 2006, began managing operations in China as a stand-alone operating segment. China was previously included in our Asia Pacific operating segment. Additionally, we began managing Europe, which was previously managed as one operating segment, as two operating segments: "Central and Eastern Europe" and "Western Europe, Middle East and Africa."
Also effective January 1, 2006, we began allocating certain expenses, previously classified as global expenses, to our business segments. Other costs associated with the corporate function remain unallocated as global expenses.
Segment reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, will reflect the changes described above.
For comparison purposes, prior-year segment reporting and supplemental disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications and allocations had no impact on our consolidated results, including net income and earnings per share for the prior periods.
Schedules that provide prior-period segment information for each quarter of 2005 reflecting these reclassifications and allocation of global expenses are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, and are incorporated herein by reference.
