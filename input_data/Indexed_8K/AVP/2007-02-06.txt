NEW YORK, N.Y., February 6, 2007  Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported that fourth-quarter 2006 total revenue rose 9% year over year (6% in local currency) to $2.6 billion. Active Representatives grew 5%, and units increased 2% versus the prior-year quarter.
Growth in sales of Beauty products in the quarter outpaced overall sales growth, at 11% in dollars and 7% in local currency. These results reflect growth in all categories, with the largest increases in the fragrance and color categories.
Fourth-quarter operating profit of $282 million was 5%, or $15 million, lower than the 2005 level. Operating margin was 10.8%, versus 12.4% in the prior-year quarter.
Andrea Jung, chairman and CEO, commented, "With 9% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to feel good about the progress we are making against our
Avon - 2
turnaround plan. Boosted by this strong quarterly performance, full-year revenue finished ahead of our expectations. The investments we are making in our business are clearly starting to deliver results," she said.
The 2006 fourth-quarter operating profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $44 million of net costs to implement the current phase of the company's ongoing restructuring program, the most significant initiative being a previously announced realignment of Avon's North American distribution network. The 2005 fourth-quarter operating profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately $56 million of costs to implement the initial phase of the company's restructuring program. The 2006 quarter also included approximately $42 million of incremental costs, related to the company's previously announced Product Line Simplification program.
In line with the company's turnaround initiative to improve brand competitiveness, fourth quarter 2006 included a $43 million, or 95%, increase in advertising, to $89 million. The increase supported new product introductions, such as and , as well as Avon China's direct-selling launch.

Fourth-quarter 2006 expenses also included year-over-year increases in provisions for performance-based compensation and reinstatement of a 401(k) matching program. Operating profit was reduced by $13 million as a result of Avon's adoption of stock-option expensing, effective January 1, 2006, and design changes to share-based compensation plans related to that adoption.
Interest expense in the fourth quarter 2006 rose significantly year over year. The increase was due to a higher debt level primarily associated with the company's share repurchase program, as well as higher interest rates.

The quarter's effective tax rate of 30.4% was significantly lower than 2005's rate of 35.7%. The 2006 rate benefited from the net favorable impact of closure of tax years by expiration of the statute of limitations and audit settlements. Net income in the fourth quarter 2006 was $184 million, or $.41 per share, compared with $183 million, or $.40 per share, a year ago.
Fourth-Quarter Regional Highlights
In the North America region, fourth-quarter revenue rose 4% (3% in local currency) from the prior-year period, and units were 1% higher. Beauty growth of 2% was positive for the first time in eight quarters. Active Representatives increased 1%, marking the first time in nine quarters that this measure has been favorable versus the prior year. The company credited positive early response from initiatives to increase Representative ordering activity, as well as an easing in the negative impact from higher fuel prices, for the improvement in Active Representatives. Operating profit decreased 2%, as it was negatively impacted by higher costs to implement restructuring initiatives, a substantial increase in advertising and incremental inventory obsolescence expense. The region's operating margin was 8.9%.
In Latin America, fourth-quarter revenue grew 13% (12% in local currency). The region's revenue benefited from ongoing strength in Brazil, Avon's second largest market. Brazil's fourth quarter top-line growth approached 30%, resulting in full-year 2006 revenue of over $1 billion. Colombia's fourth-quarter revenue growth was approximately 50%, despite lapping the acquisition of that business in mid-October. The performances of these two markets more than offset continued softness in Mexico, where revenue decreased 9%. The region's Active Representatives rose 6% and units increased 4%. Operating profit was flat with the prior year, as benefits of higher revenue offset incremental inventory obsolescence expense and other increased expenses, mainly advertising. Operating margin was 17.2%.

Western Europe, Middle East and Africa continued to achieve solid revenue growth, driven by increases in nearly all markets, and importantly in Turkey and the U.K. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 10% (5% in local currency). Both Active Representatives and units increased 2% versus the prior-year period. Operating profit decreased 9%, due to incremental inventory obsolescence expense, and operating margin was 5.2%.
In Central & Eastern Europe, revenue in the fourth quarter rose 17% (8% in local currency), aided by strong growth in fragrances and a return to growth in color cosmetics, up nearly 20%, across the region. Russia's fourth quarter top-line growth was over 20%, resulting in full-year 2006 revenue of over $500 million. The region's Active Representatives grew 10%, while units sold decreased 1%. Operating profit rose 7% year over year, and operating margin was 23.2%. Operating profit was unfavorably impacted by inventory obsolescence and advertising expenses.
Asia Pacific revenue was 2% lower in the quarter (6% lower in local currency). Active Representatives decreased 7% and units declined 6%. The region continued to be unfavorably impacted by a decline in Japan as well as the first-quarter 2006 closing of Indonesian operations. Japan's fourth-quarter revenue declined 13% year over year, compared with a drop of nearly 30% in 2006's first half. Japan's results reflect early response to actions to improve direct selling and recalibrate the level of its direct mailings. The region's operating profit was 11% lower year over year, largely due to higher inventory obsolescence and the revenue decline. Operating margin was 5.2%.

Revenue in China grew 28% (24% in local currency), reflecting further expansion of the company's direct-selling business. The exit of company-run store counters in early 2006 had a negative eight-point impact on the quarter's revenue growth. At year end, Avon China had over 350,000 licensed Sales Promoters registered with the government and was engaged in training these Sales Promoters to become Active Representatives within Avon's direct-selling business. Units were 23% higher versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. China reduced its operating loss to $2.9 million from fourth-quarter 2005's loss of $7.0 million. Operating margin was (4.3)%.
Total global expenses rose 73%, largely due to higher compensation-related expense as well as costs to implement restructuring initiatives.
Full-Year Results
For full-year 2006, Avon reported that total revenue grew 8% (6% in local currency), to a record $8.8 billion, versus $8.1 billion in 2005, and sales of Beauty products increased in line with overall revenue growth. Active Representatives grew 5% and units were 2% higher. Both years included significant costs to implement restructuring, with those costs totaling $229 million in 2006 and $56 million in 2005. Additionally, 2006 was impacted by approximately $81 million of incremental costs, related to the company's previously announced Product Line Simplification program. Avon said it spent $249 million on advertising in 2006, 83% more than in 2005, far exceeding its original target of a 50% increase for the year. 2006 net income was $478 million compared with $848 million in 2005, and 2006 earnings per share were $1.06, 41% lower than earnings of $1.81 per share in the prior year.

Despite 2006 being a transition year in the company's turnaround program, cash flow from operations totaled $796 million versus $896 million in 2005. Share repurchases in 2006 totaled $355 million. In 2005, Avon spent $728 million to repurchase shares, completing both a five-year $1 billion authorization begun in 2000 and an incremental $500 million share repurchase initiative launched in late 2005.
Andrea Jung, chairman and CEO, commented, "We began an aggressive attack of Avon's cost structure in 2006, with the goal of achieving in excess of $300 million in savings by 2009. Our early actions delivered more than $100 million in benefits for the year, all of which was invested to fuel the topline. Late in the year, we launched two additional strategic initiatives, Product Line Simplification and a Strategic Sourcing Initiative, with the potential to contribute significantly higher benefits beyond our earlier actions. These additional benefits will enable us to invest even more going forward," Ms. Jung added.
"As we move into 2007, we are still in the early years of our multi-year turnaround," she said. "We are confident that our plan is the right one, and we remain committed to restoring Avon to sustainable growth."
