On December 5, 2007, Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "Form RSU Agreement") and a form of Retention Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the "Form Retention RSU Agreement" and collectively with the Form RSU Agreement, the "Agreements") under the Avon Products, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, pursuant to which the Company grants various awards to its senior officers, including its named executive officers, from time to time.
Restricted stock unit awards granted under the Agreements ("RSUs") are subject to certain vesting and payment provisions. Specifically, any RSUs granted vest 100% after three years. Upon a grantee's voluntary departure or departure for cause from the Company, any outstanding RSUs are automatically forfeited. Upon a grantee's permanent disability, 100% of any outstanding RSUs would vest and be settled on the original vesting date specified in the terms of the grant. Upon a grantee's death, 100% of any outstanding RSUs would vest and the grantee's estate would receive such settlement at or around the time of death. Upon a grantee's involuntary departure from the Company without cause, any outstanding RSUs would vest on a prorated basis to the last day worked and be settled at or around the time of departure. Upon a change in control of the Company, 100% of any outstanding RSUs would vest and shares would be issued to the grantee as soon as practicable. Upon a grantee's retirement from the Company, any outstanding RSUs under the Form Retention RSU Agreement are automatically forfeited, whereas 100% of any outstanding RSUs under the Form RSU Agreement would vest and be settled on the original vesting date specified in the terms of the grant.
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Agreements, and reference is made to the complete text of the Agreements which are attached hereto as exhibits and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: February 7, 2008
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
1. Pursuant to the provisions of its 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") has awarded you (the "Grantee") Restricted Stock Units (the "RSUs"), representing the right to receive in the future shares of Stock (the "Shares") as set forth in the Grantee's grant notification. These RSUs are subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, as well as those terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, all of which are hereby incorporated by this reference. All capitalized terms used in this Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this "Agreement") shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan.
Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Award.
2. These RSUs represent a right to receive Shares on the Vesting Date (as defined below) but do not represent a current interest in the Shares. If all the terms and conditions hereof and of the Plan are met, then the Grantee shall be issued certificates for the respective number of Shares on the Vesting Date (or earlier as provided in this Agreement). In lieu of issuance of Shares, the Company reserves the right to instead make a cash payment to the Grantee equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares determined as of the Vesting Date (or earlier as provided in this Agreement).
Nature of RSUs; Issuance of Shares.
3. These RSUs may not be sold, tendered, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered.
Restrictions on Transfer of RSUs.
4.
Vesting of RSUs; Voting; Dividends.
(a) Subject to Section 5, vesting and settlement of the RSUs shall occur on the date set forth in the Grantee's grant notification (such date the "Vesting Date"), provided, however, that the RSUs shall vest sooner upon the occurrence of a Change in Control and such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of a Change in Control. Subject to Section 5, vesting is contingent upon the Grantee being employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the Vesting Date, or on the date of the Change in Control.
(b) The Grantee does not have the right to vote any of the Shares or to receive dividends on them prior to the date such Shares are to be issued to the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof. However, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Grantee shall be entitled to "Dividend Equivalent Rights" so that the Grantee will receive a cash payment in respect of the Shares in amounts that would otherwise be payable as dividends with respect to such number of Shares, when and as dividends are paid.
5.
Termination of Employment.
(a) . If the Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company (and, if applicable, by any Subsidiary for whom the Grantee is employed) other than for Cause and the Grantee is not eligible for Retirement at the end of the payment period under a severance pay plan of the Company or some other agreement between the Grantee and the Company, then a pro-rata portion of the RSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and the appropriate number of such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee within thirty (30) days after such termination date, unless such Grantee is a "specified employee" on the termination date, as defined in Code Section 409A and determined pursuant to procedures and elections made by the Company from time to time, in which case, the vested Shares shall be issued on the date which is six months after the termination date. The number of Shares that vest shall be determined by multiplying the full number of Shares subject to the RSU by a fraction, which shall be the number of complete months of employment from the date of grant (the "Grant Date") to the date of termination (last day of active employment), divided by the number of months from the Grant Date to the Vesting Date.
Termination by the Company without Cause
(b) . If the Grantee's employment is voluntarily terminated due to Retirement, or the Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company (and, if applicable by any Subsidiary for whom the Grantee is employed) other than for Cause and the Grantee is eligible for Retirement at the end of the payment period under a severance pay plan of the Company or some other agreement between the Grantee and the Company, then all of the RSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee on the Vesting Date.
Termination due to Retirement
(c) . If the Grantee's employment is terminated due to Disability, then all of the RSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee on the Vesting Date.
Termination due to Disability
 
(d) . If the Grantee dies, then all of the RSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee's designated beneficiary (or if none, the Grantee's estate) within thirty (30) days after such death.
Death
(e) . If the Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company (and, if applicable, by any Subsidiary for whom the Grantee is employed) for Cause, or if the Grantee voluntarily terminates employment for any reason other than Retirement, Disability or death, then all RSUs shall be forfeited. "Cause" shall have the same meaning as that provided in the Company's severance pay plan on the Grant Date. In addition, termination for Cause shall include any termination due to acts of dishonesty or gross misconduct on the part of the Grantee which result, or are intended to result, in damage to the Company's business or reputation.
Termination by the Company for Cause or by the Grantee for Any Reason Other than Retirement, Disability or Death
(f) For purposes of determining the vesting of RSUs under this Agreement, a paid or an unpaid/long-term leave of absence of the Grantee shall not constitute a termination of employment of the Grantee, except to the extent that such leave of absence constitutes a "separation from service" (as defined in Code Section 409A). During a paid or an unpaid/long-term leave of absence until a "separation from service" occurs, the RSUs shall continue to vest as set forth in the grant notification referred to in Section 4(a) of this Agreement.
6. . The Grantee agrees that, during the Grantee's employment, beginning on the Grant Date, and for a period of one year after the termination of the Grantee's employment with the Company (and, if applicable, a Subsidiary) for any reason whatsoever (including Retirement or Disability), he or she shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, engage in any of the following activities:

(c) the Grantee shall not, unless compelled pursuant to an order of a court or other body having jurisdiction over such matter, communicate or divulge any secret or confidential information, knowledge or data, including without limitation any trade secrets, relating to the Company or a Subsidiary, and their respective businesses, obtained by the Grantee during his or her employment by the Company or a Subsidiary and which is not otherwise publicly known (other than by reason of an unauthorized act by the Grantee), to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.
In the event the Company determines that the Grantee has breached any term of this Section 6 or any non-disclosure, non-compete or non-solicitation covenant set forth in his or her severance agreement, employment contract or any Company policy, in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, (i) all unvested RSUs granted hereunder shall be forfeited, (ii) if shares of Stock have been issued to the Grantee in respect of vested RSUs hereunder, the Grantee shall forfeit all such shares of Stock so issued to the Grantee hereunder and (iii) if cash has been paid to the Grantee in lieu of shares of Stock in respect of vested RSUs hereunder, the Grantee shall pay to the Company all such cash so paid in lieu of shares of Stock to the Grantee hereunder; , , that if the Grantee no longer holds shares of Stock issued to the Grantee hereunder, the Grantee shall pay to the Company in cash the Fair Market Value of any such shares of Stock on the date such shares of Stock were issued to the Grantee hereunder.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if, on the applicable vesting date, the delivery of Shares is not made because the Grantee has not retired or because of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A requirements or because the Grantee elects pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan to defer the delivery of any Shares payable hereunder, the Grantee hereby irrevocably elects to satisfy all applicable FICA taxes due on the applicable vesting date with respect to such Shares for which delivery is being deferred by delivering cash to the Company in an amount sufficient to satisfy all such FICA taxes.
