NEW YORK, N.Y., April 29, 2008  Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported that first-quarter 2008 total revenue grew 14% year over year (6% in local currency) to $2.5 billion.

Net income in the first quarter 2008 was $185 million compared with $150 million in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share were $.43 versus $.34 per share in the prior-year quarter, or 26% higher.
Andrea Jung, chairman and CEO, commented, "Again this quarter we produced solid results on the momentum of our turnaround plan and the strength of our well-balanced geographic portfolio. Active Representative growth accelerated to one of the highest growth levels in many years, 14%. This reflects our investments in the Representative Value Proposition (RVP), such as expanding our Sales Leadership program, increasing sales campaign frequency and improving commissions and incentives to our Representatives. Additionally, we continued to benefit from our strength in developing and emerging markets around the globe to more than offset the unfavorable impact of economic softness and service problems in North America.
"With this solid start to the year, and despite the challenges in North America, we remain confident that we can deliver on our 2008 objectives to achieve a full-year operating margin that approaches 2005's level of approximately 14% and revenue growth in line with our long-term target of mid-single-digit growth," Ms. Jung concluded.
The company's 17% growth in Beauty sales included increases in all categories: Fragrance grew 20%, Color was up 15%, Personal Care rose 15% and Skin Care increased 13%.

First-quarter operating profit of $296 million increased 25% from 2007's level of $238 million, while operating margin was 11.8% versus 10.9% in the prior-year quarter. First-quarter 2008 operating profit included costs associated with the company's restructuring program of $26 million ($.04 per share after tax), versus costs of $27 million ($.04 per share after tax) related to the company's Product Line Simplification (PLS) and restructuring programs in the prior-year period.
Avon reiterated that it expects to achieve annualized savings of approximately $430 million once all initiatives of its multi-year restructuring program, launched in late 2005, are fully implemented by 2011  2012. Those savings are projected to reach $270 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2009. The company anticipates costs to implement all restructuring initiatives from inception to completion to be approximately $530 million. Approximately $469 million of those costs were recorded through the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, Avon reiterated that it expects to achieve annualized benefits in excess of $200 million each from its PLS program and Strategic Sourcing Initiative, bringing total annualized savings and benefits from all three programs to over $830 million when fully implemented.
First-quarter 2008's results included $82 million in advertising expense, a 14% increase over prior year, to support the launch of new products, such as andand, as well as Representative recruitment advertising. Additionally, 2008's first quarter included an incremental $37 million of costs for initiatives to improve RVP.

The quarter's effective tax rate of 33.2% compared with 2007's rate of 32.4%.
At quarter end, Avon's total debt had increased $145 million from the year-end level, and cash had decreased $71 million. Net cash used by operations was $41 million through three months of 2008, including a payment of $38 million upon settlement of treasury-lock agreements associated with the company's recent debt issuance, compared with $160 million of cash used by operations in the same period of 2007. This favorable comparison was due in large part to lower post-employment-benefit plan contributions. Looking forward, the company said that it continues to expect full-year 2008 cash flow from operations to be substantially higher than that of full-year 2007.

In the North America region, first-quarter revenue decreased 6% (7% in local currency) over that of the prior year, reflecting the impact of a weak economy, and to a lesser degree, service-related problems in filling Representatives' orders. Active Representatives increased 2%. Units sold decreased 10% from the prior-year level. Sales of Beauty products were 3% lower. Sales of non-beauty products declined 9%, tracking with the general retail environment. Operating profit was 17% lower than in the 2007 quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower revenues and higher spending on RVP, among other costs. The region's operating margin was 10.8%. While the company expects continued weakness in this region in the second quarter, the degree of decline is expected to be less than that experienced in the first quarter.
In Central & Eastern Europe, first-quarter revenue rose 17% (6% in local currency), with several markets up in excess of 20%. Russia posted 12% revenue expansion.
