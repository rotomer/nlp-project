Regulation FD Disclosure.
Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE: AVP) announced today, October 20, 2008, that it is voluntarily conducting an internal investigation of its China operations, focusing on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA").  The Company, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, commenced in June 2008 an internal investigation after it received an allegation that certain travel, entertainment and other expenses may have been improperly incurred in connection with the Company's China operations.  To lead the investigation, the Company has engaged the independent international law firm of Mayer Brown LLP.
 
The Company has voluntarily contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Department of Justice to advise both agencies that an internal investigation is underway. The internal investigation is in its early stage and no conclusion can be drawn at this time as to its outcome.
