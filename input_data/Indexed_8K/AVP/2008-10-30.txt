Operating profit rose 33%, to $297 million from $224 million, and the company's operating margin rose to 11.2% from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter 2008 was $223 million compared with $139 million in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share were $.52 versus $.32 per share in the prior-year quarter, or 63% higher. Earnings per share in the 2008 quarter benefitted from one-time tax adjustments of $.09 per share.
Andrea Jung, chairman and CEO, commented, "Avon's third-quarter performance reflects continued momentum of our turnaround plan. Our investments in advertising and the Representative Value Proposition (RVP) are yielding strong results. Again this quarter, growth in our Beauty sales outpaced our overall revenue growth rate. Additionally, our performance is benefitting from the savings and benefits from our restructuring program and strategic initiatives, as those programs remain on track to our longer term expectations."
The company's 15% growth in Beauty sales included increases in all categories: Color was up 19%, Fragrance grew 18%, Skin Care increased 9% and Personal Care rose 13%.
Beauty sales benefitted in part from a year-over-year 11% increase in advertising expense, to $106 million. Advertising supported the launch of new products, such as the line of skin care, fragrances and lipstick, as well as Representative recruitment advertising in priority markets. Additionally, 2008's third quarter included an incremental $21 million of costs for initiatives to improve the Representative Value Proposition.

Third-quarter 2008 operating profit included costs associated with the company's restructuring program of $14 million ($.02 per share after tax), versus costs of $33 million ($.05 per share after tax) related to the company's restructuring program ($27 million) and Product Line Simplification initiative (PLS) ($6 million) in the prior-year period.
Avon reiterated that it expects to achieve annualized savings of approximately $430 million once all initiatives of its multi-year restructuring program, launched in late 2005, are fully implemented by 20112012. Those savings are expected to reach $270 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2009. The company anticipates costs to implement all restructuring initiatives from inception to completion to be approximately $530 million. Additionally, Avon reiterated that beginning in 2010, it expects to achieve in excess of $200 million annual benefits each from its PLS program and Strategic Sourcing Initiative for a total in excess of $400 million from these two programs and over $830 million annually from all initiatives when fully implemented.
At quarter end, Avon's total debt had increased $313 million from the year-end level, and cash had increased $4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $303 million through nine months of 2008, compared with $63 million in the same period of 2007. This favorable comparison was due in large part to higher net income and improved management of inventory and accounts receivable levels. Looking forward, the company said that it continues to expect full-year 2008 cash flow from operating activities to be substantially higher than that of full-year 2007.

.
In Central & Eastern Europe, third-quarter revenue rose 17% (5% in local currency). The region's growth was driven by Russia, where revenue increased 12%, and also Ukraine, where revenue expanded 50%. The region's Active Representatives grew 5%. Units sold increased 2%. Operating profit was 13% lower than the prior year, as the region's revenue increase was offset by higher RVP and advertising expense and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on product costs. The region's third-quarter operating margin was 15.5%.

The company has not experienced a measurable impact on its business outside of North America from the current economic and financial crisis. While the company considers the consequences of possible deterioration in these economies and remains watchful of its business trends in these markets, it currently expects fourth-quarter 2008 local-currency revenue growth rates in these markets similar to those of the third quarter. The negative consumer environment in North America continues to weigh on Avon's performance in that region, and the company expects that trend to further deteriorate in the fourth quarter. Additionally, recent significant movements in foreign-exchange rates, if maintained at current levels, will negatively impact fourth-quarter and full-year 2008 growth rates and operating margins. As a result, the company now expects a full-year 2008 operating margin in the range of 13%, compared with its previous expectation of an operating margin approaching 2005's level of approximately 14%.
Avon believes that it will continue to generate strong operating cash flow. Combined with global cash balances approaching $1 billion and a single-A credit rating, this should more than enable the company to meet its financial needs.
