NEW YORK, N.Y., February 3, 2009  Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported fourth-quarter 2008 earnings per share of $.54, up 80% year over year bringing full-year 2008 earnings per share to $2.04, 69% ahead of the prior year.
Fourth-quarter 2008 total revenue of $2.8 billion was 9% lower than 2007's fourth quarter as the impact of a substantial shift in many foreign-currency exchange rates more than offset local-currency revenue growth of 2% year over year. For full-year 2008, Avon reported that total revenue grew 8% (5% in local currency), to a record $10.7 billion.
Fourth-quarter 2008 operating profit was $372 million, up 66%, from $225 million in the prior-year quarter, and full-year 2008 operating profit was $1.3 billion, up 53% from 2007's level. The company's fourth-quarter operating margin rose to 13.3%, 600 basis points above 7.3% in the year-ago quarter. Full-year 2008 operating margin was 12.5%, 370 basis points above 2007's 8.8%. Results of both 2008 periods benefited from significantly lower costs associated with the company's restructuring program and Product Line Simplification (PLS) initiative.
Details of 2008 Results
Fourth-quarter 2008 total revenue benefited 5% from pricing and product mix, units sold decreased 3% and foreign exchange lowered revenue 11% versus the prior-year quarter. For full-year 2008, total revenue benefited 4% from pricing and product mix, units sold increased 1% and foreign exchange increased revenue 3%.
Active Representatives grew 4% and 7% year over year in the fourth quarter and full year 2008, respectively.
Beauty sales in the fourth quarter 2008 were 7% lower versus the prior-year period as the impact of foreign exchange more than offset a local-currency increase of 4%, which was driven by growth in all categories, particularly: Fragrance and Skin Care. For the full year, Beauty sales rose 10% (7% in local currency).
 
Advertising expense decreased 7% in the fourth quarter to $100 million. On a full-year basis, advertising increased 6% to $391 million. The company invested an incremental $9 million and $83 million of costs versus the prior-year periods, in the fourth quarter and full-year 2008, respectively, for initiatives to improve the Representative Value Proposition.
Fourth-quarter 2008 operating profit included costs associated with the company's restructuring program of $7 million ($.01 per share). This compared with costs of $205 million ($.34 per share) related to the company's restructuring program ($101 million) and PLS initiative ($104 million) in the prior-year period. Likewise, both 2008 and 2007 full-year results included costs associated with the restructuring program, and 2007 also included significant costs associated with the company's PLS initiative. Those costs totaled $61 million ($.09 per share) and $346 million ($.56 per share) in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Avon continues to expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately $430 million once all initiatives of its multi-year restructuring program, launched in late 2005, are fully implemented by 20112012. Those savings are expected to reach $300 million in 2009. The company anticipates costs to implement all restructuring initiatives under the program from inception to completion to be approximately $530 million. Avon continues to expect to achieve in excess of $200 million annual benefits each, beginning in 2010, from its PLS program and Strategic Sourcing Initiative for a total in excess of $400 million from these two programs and over $830 million annually from all initiatives when fully implemented.
 
The fourth quarter's effective tax rate of 32.3% compared with 2007's rate of 34.2%. Net income in the fourth quarter 2008 was $232 million compared with $129 million in the year-ago quarter. The full-year 2008 tax rate was 29.3% versus 33.0% in 2007. The full-year 2008 rate benefited from a one-time adjustment primarily resulting from an audit settlement. Net income for 2008 was $875 million compared with $531 million in 2007.
Avon finished 2008 with cash of $1.1 billion, up from $963 million at year-end 2007, and total debt was $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion at the respective dates. Cash flow from operations improved to $748 million in 2008 versus $590 million in 2007, primarily due to higher net income. Reflecting the company's financial position, Avon's Board of Directors this morning approved a 5% dividend increase for 2009, raising Avon's annual dividend to $.84 per share. 2009 marks the 19
th
consecutive year of a regular dividend increase. Shares repurchased in 2008 totaled $172 million, compared with $667 million in 2007.
Outlook
Andrea Jung, chairman and CEO, commented, "After nine months of strong sales performance, the significant negative impact of foreign exchange and the depressed economy hurt our fourth-quarter revenue performance.
"It is prudent to assume these pressures will continue for the foreseeable future, and we therefore anticipate that 2009 will be a challenging year. While we cannot control movements in foreign currency, our focus, as always, will be on building and managing our business for the long term, and continuously driving our costs lower as part of our constant turnaround mentality.'
 
"We believe our model is well suited to create income opportunities in these difficult economic times, as we have during past challenges. Our model also allows us to emphasize "smart value" products in the Avon brochure. Such products have always been a hallmark of our brand, and are even more attractive today given our improvements in product innovation and brand image. Throughout our history, these advantages have allowed Avon to emerge well positioned as economic conditions improve.
"In terms of our cost structure, we intend to take significant additional steps to transform our value chain, as well as to aggressively reduce non-strategic spending in the current year. Our success with cost transformation as part of our turnaround has proven our ability to move swiftly and boldly to address key opportunities.
"We are fortunate to be facing these challenging times from a position of financial strength. We have a solid balance sheet, an operating model that generates healthy cash flow and a continued commitment to our dividend. This strong foundation, coupled with the continuing execution of our turnaround strategies and the competitive advantages of our direct selling business model, gives us confidence to look past 2009's challenges and to continue our focus on long-term sustainable, profitable growth," concluded Jung.
 
Regional Results
Latin America's fourth-quarter revenue was 5% lower year over year as foreign exchange declines more than offset 11% local-currency revenue growth.

The region's Active Representatives grew 2%, and units sold were up 3%. Operating profit was 28% higher (54% higher in local currency) primarily due to the higher local-currency sales performance and lower inventory obsolescence expense.
