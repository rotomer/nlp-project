On March 2, 2009, Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") completed a public offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $350 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.500% Notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes" and, together with the 2014 Notes, the "Notes"). The Notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-149402), dated February 27, 2008, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2008 and supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated February 25, 2009. The net proceeds from the sale, which are expected to be $837,611,000, will be used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Company's commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted our indebtedness under the 2014 Notes to a variable interest rate based on LIBOR.
The Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of February 25, 2009, among the Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of the Notes. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein, the Company agreed to sell the Notes to the Underwriters, and the Underwriters agreed to purchase the Notes for resale to the public. The Company sold the 2014 Notes to the Underwriters at a purchase price of 98.855% of the principal amount thereof, and the Underwriters offered the 2014 Notes to the public at a price of 99.455% of the principal amount thereof. The Company sold the 2019 Notes to the Underwriters at a purchase price of 98.096% of the principal amount thereof, and the Underwriters offered the 2019 Notes to the public at a price of 98.746% of the principal amount thereof. Interest is payable on the Notes on each March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2009. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company has also agreed to indemnify the Underwriters and certain controlling persons against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and to contribute to payments the Underwriters may be required to make in respect of any of these liabilities.
The Notes are governed by and were issued pursuant to an Indenture between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), dated as of February 27, 2008 (the "Indenture"), as supplemented by the Third Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 2, 2009 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 2, 2009 between the Company and the Trustee (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Third Supplemental Indenture, the "Supplemental Indentures"). The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture, Supplemental Indentures and Notes contain covenants that limit the Company's ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company's assets. The terms of the Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase Notes upon a change of control repurchase event (as defined in the Supplemental Indentures) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Supplemental Indentures and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, which are filed as exhibits hereto and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

(c) . The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request.
Delivery of Registration Statements and Prospectuses
(d) . The Company will comply with the Act and the Exchange Act so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the Notes as contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus. If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or the circumstances then prevailing not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representatives so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (w) notify the Representatives of any such event, (x) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 3, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (y) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (z) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as the Representatives may reasonably request.
Continued Compliance with Securities Laws
(e) . The Company agrees that, unless it has or shall have obtained the prior written consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has or shall have obtained, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than a free writing prospectus containing the information contained in the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 3(b) hereto; that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses included in Schedule C hereto and any electronic road show; and provided further that the
Permitted Free Writing Prospectuses
provided
 
Underwriters are authorized to use the information with respect to the final terms of the Notes in communications conveying customary information relating to the offering to investors. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representatives or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
(f) . The Company will use its reasonable best efforts, in cooperation with the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, to qualify or register the Notes for offering and sale under the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representatives may designate and to maintain such qualifications in effect for as long as necessary to complete the distribution of the Notes, up to one year from the date of this Agreement; , , that the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.
Blue Sky Qualifications
provided
however
(g) . The Company will timely file such reports pursuant to the Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its securityholders as soon as practicable an earning statement for the purposes of, and to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section 11(a) of the Act.
Earning Statement
(h) . During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives (which consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the Representatives), sell, offer, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company similar to the Notes other than as contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the Notes and other than commercial paper issued in the ordinary course of business).
Agreement Not to Offer or Sell Additional Securities
(i) . The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Notes.
No Manipulation of Price
The Representatives, on behalf of the several Underwriters, may, in their sole discretion, waive in writing the performance by the Company of any one or more of the foregoing covenants or grant the Company additional time in which to perform such covenants.
SECTION 4. . The Company will pay or cause to be paid all expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and the Company's accountants in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes and all other fees or expenses (excluding fees or expenses of the Underwriters' counsel) in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and
Payment of Expenses
 
the Final Prospectus and all amendments and supplements thereto, including all printing costs associated therewith, and the delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters, in the quantities herein above specified, (ii) all costs and expenses related to the transfer and delivery of the Notes to the Underwriters, including any transfer or other taxes payable thereon, (iii) the cost of printing or producing any Blue Sky or legal investment memorandum in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes under state securities laws and all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Notes for offer and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 3(f) hereof, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky or legal investment memorandum, (iv) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the Notes, (v) all document production charges and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters (but not including their fees for professional services) in connection with the preparation of this Agreement, (vi) the costs and charges of the Trustee and any transfer agent, registrar or depositary, (vii) the cost of the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Notes and (viii) the costs and expenses of the Company relating to investor presentations on any "road show" undertaken in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Notes. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section, Section 6, and the last paragraph of Section 8, the Underwriters will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsels, transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Notes by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
SECTION 5. . The several obligations of the Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Notes are subject to the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
Conditions to Underwriters' Obligations
(a) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date:
(i) there shall not have occurred any downgrading, nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded the Company or any of the Company's securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act;
(ii) there shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business or operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from that set forth in the Disclosure Package (exclusive of any amendments or supplements thereto subsequent to the date of this Agreement) that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and that makes it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable to market the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Agreement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus; and
(iii) there shall not be any stop order in effect suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, nor shall any proceedings for such purpose be pending before or threatened by the Commission.
 
(b) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date a certificate, dated the Closing Date and signed by an officer of the Company, to the effect set forth in Section 5(a)(i) and to the effect that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct as of the Closing Date (as if made on the Closing Date) and that the Company has complied with all of the agreements and satisfied all of the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder on or before the Closing Date.
The officer signing and delivering such certificate may rely upon the best of his or her knowledge as to proceedings threatened.
(c) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion and negative assurance letter of Latham & Watkins LLP, outside counsel for the Company, and an opinion of Latham & Watkins LLP, outside tax counsel for the Company, each dated the Closing Date, to the effect set forth in Exhibits A-1 and A-2. The opinions of Latham & Watkins LLP described in this Section 5(c) shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
(d) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion from the General Counsel of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect set forth in Exhibit B. The opinion of the General Counsel of the Company described in this Section 5(d) shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the Company and shall so state therein.
(e) The Underwriters shall have received on the Closing Date an opinion from counsel for the Underwriters with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Indenture, the Notes, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters.
(f) The Underwriters shall have received on each of the date hereof and the Closing Date a letter, dated the date hereof or the Closing Date, as the case may be, in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriters and the Company's independent accountants, from the Company's independent public accountants, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference into the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
SECTION 6. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any Underwriter or any such controlling person in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Notes as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or any other preliminary prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free
Indemnification and Contribution
 
Writing Prospectus or the information contained in the final term sheet required to be prepared and filed pursuant to Section 3(b) hereto, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter expressly for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 6(a) or 6(b), such person (the "indemnified party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. The failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph Section 6(a) or 6(b) unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in Section 6(a) or 6(b). In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) above, and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(b) above. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent
 
or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 6(a) or 6(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 6(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 6(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of such Notes (before deducting expenses but after deduction of the discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Final Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the Notes. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 6 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of
pro rata
 
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 6 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Notes.
SECTION 7. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination by notice given by the Representatives to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Notes on the terms and in the manner contemplated in this Agreement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus.
Termination
SECTION 8. . If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the amount of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as the Representatives may specify, to purchase the Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event
Defaulting Underwriters
 
shall the amount of Notes that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 8 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such amount of Notes without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes and the aggregate amount of Notes with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
SECTION 9. . This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
SECTION 10. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Dated: March 2, 2009
 
 
This is one of the Securities referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company designated as its 6.500% Notes due 2019 (herein called the "Securities"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $350,000,000, issued under an indenture dated as of February 27, 2008 (herein called the "Original Indenture"), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), as supplemented by a fourth supplemental indenture, dated as of March 2, 2009, between the Company and the Trustee (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
The Securities will bear interest, payable on each Interest Payment Date to Holders of record on the fifteenth calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, at 6.500% per annum until March 1, 2019 or the cancellation of the Securities.
The Securities are the Company's unsecured senior obligation and rank equally with the Company's other existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Securities are redeemable, as a whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time or from time to time, by the Company mailing notice to the registered address of each Holder of Securities at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the redemption. The Redemption Price will be equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below) on those Securities discounted on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate (as defined below) plus 50 basis points with respect to any Securities being redeemed. Accrued interest, if any, will be paid to the Redemption Date.
Subject to payment by the Company of a sum sufficient to pay the amount due on redemption, interest on this Security (or portion hereof if this Security is redeemed in part) shall cease to accrue upon the Redemption Date of this Security (or portion hereof if this Security is redeemed in part).
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Securities being redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Securities being redeemed.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, as determined by the Company (i) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (ii) if the Company obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers appointed by the Trustee at the Company's direction.
"Redemption Date", when used with respect to any Security to be redeemed, means the date which is a Business Day fixed for such redemption by the Company pursuant to the Indenture.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Company, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Company by such Reference Treasury Dealer, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
"Reference Treasury Dealers" means any four nationally recognized investment banking firms, and their successors, selected by the Company that are each also a primary U.S. Government securities dealer. If any Reference Treasury Dealer shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, the Company will substitute another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer.
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" means, with respect to the Securities to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of principal of and interest on those Securities that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for that redemption; that if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to the Securities to be redeemed, the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment on those Securities will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued on such Securities to such Redemption Date.
provided, however,
"Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity (computed as of the second Business Day immediately preceding that Redemption Date) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that Redemption Date.
On or after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or any portion of the Securities called for redemption (unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest). On or before the Redemption Date, the Company will deposit with a paying agent (or the Trustee) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on the Securities to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee, pro rata, by lot or by a method the Trustee deems to be fair and appropriate.
The Securities do not have the benefit of a sinking fund.
If a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined below) occurs pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, unless the Company has defeased the Securities pursuant to Article 12 of the Original Indenture or has exercised its right to redeem such Securities pursuant to Section 2.08 of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the Company will
 
make an offer to each Holder of the Securities to repurchase all or any part (in integral multiples of $1,000) of the Securities held by such Holder at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Securities repurchased to, but not including, the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Company's option, prior to any Change of Control (as defined below), but after the public announcement of an impending Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase the Securities with respect to which a Change of Control Repurchase Event shall have occurred on the payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed. The notice shall, if mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, state that the offer to repurchase is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the payment date specified in the notice.
The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Securities as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Securities, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Securities by virtue of such conflict.
On the Change of Control Repurchase Event payment date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:
 
 
 
The Trustee will promptly mail to each Holder of Securities properly tendered the repurchase price for the Securities, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (upon its receipt of executed Securities from the Company) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of any Securities surrendered; , that each new Security will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
provided

"Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Securities are rated below Investment Grade (as defined below) by each of the Rating Agencies (as defined below) on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Securities is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies).
"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company or one of its subsidiaries, becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the then outstanding number of shares of the Company's Voting Stock (as defined below); (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors (as defined below); or (4) the adoption of a plan relating to the Company's liquidation or dissolution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (i) (a) the Company becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and (b) the holders of the voting stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of voting stock immediately prior to that transaction, and/or (ii)(a) the Company reincorporates in another jurisdiction and (b) the holders of the Company's Voting Stock immediately following the reincorporation are substantially the same as the holders of Voting Stock immediately prior to the reincorporation.

"S&P" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of McGraw-Hill, Inc.

The Company may, from time to time, without the consent of the existing Holders of the Securities, issue additional securities under the Indenture having the same terms as the Securities in all respects, except for the issue date, the issue price and the initial interest payment date. Any such additional securities will be consolidated with and form a single series with the Securities.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless (i) such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and (iii) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Securities a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity.

As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter. With your consent, we have relied upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters. We are opining herein as to the internal laws of the State of New York and we express no opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of the laws of any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any local agencies within any state.
Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and, when the Notes have been duly executed, issued, authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered by or on behalf of the Company against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and in the circumstances contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
Our opinion is subject to: (i) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors; (ii) the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought; (iii) the invalidity under certain circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary to public policy; and (iv) we express no opinion as to (a) any provision for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties, make-whole premiums or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (b) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, arbitration, remedies, or judicial relief, (c) the waiver of rights or defenses under Section 5.15 of the Indenture, (d) any provision requiring the payment of attorneys' fees, where such payment is contrary to law or public policy, (e) any provision permitting, upon acceleration of the Notes, collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon, and (f) the severability, if invalid, of provisions to the foregoing effect.
With your consent, we have assumed (a) that the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes (collectively, the "") have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto other than the Company, (b) that the Documents constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto other than the Company, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, and (c) that the status of the Documents as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities.
