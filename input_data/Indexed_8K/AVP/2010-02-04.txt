On February 4, 2010, Avon Products, Inc. issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. The press release included Avon's consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows, and a supplemental schedule that provided additional information regarding Avon's regional results and product category sales, for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2009. A copy of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On February 4, 2010, Avon Products, Inc. announced that, effective with the beginning of its 2010 fiscal year, Avon will account for Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy. When an entity operates in a highly inflationary economy, exchange gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities and deferred income taxes resulting from changes in the exchange rate are recorded in income. Nonmonetary assets, which include inventories and property, plant and equipment, are carried forward at their historical dollar cost.
Effective January 11, 2010 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two-tier exchange structure. The official exchange rate moved from 2.15 to 2.60 for essential goods and to 4.30 for non-essential goods and services. Although no official rules have yet been issued, most of Avon's imports are expected to fall into the non-essential classification.
As a result of the change in the official rate to 4.30, Avon anticipates it will record a one-time, after-tax loss of approximately $50 million in the first quarter of 2010, primarily reflecting the write-down of monetary assets and deferred tax benefits. Additionally, certain nonmonetary assets are carried at historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation. Therefore, these costs will impact the income statement during 2010 as they will not be devalued based on the new exchange rates, but will be expensed at the historic dollar value. As a result of using the historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets acquired prior to the devaluation, such as inventory, 2010 operating profit and net income will additionally be negatively impacted by approximately $85 million, primarily during the first half of the year, for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of 2.15 and the new official exchange rate of 4.30. In addition, revenue and operating profit for Avon's Venezuela operations will be negatively impacted when translated into dollars at the new official exchange rate. This would be partially offset by the favorable impact of any operating performance improvements. Results for periods prior to 2010 will not be impacted by the change in accounting treatment of Venezuela as a highly inflationary economy or by the change in the official rate in January of 2010.

NEW YORK, N.Y., February 4, 2010  Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported that fourth-quarter 2009 total revenue of $3.2 billion was 13% higher than that of fourth-quarter 2008, or 8% higher on a local-currency basis. Active Representatives grew 11% with growth in all regions. Beauty sales in the fourth-quarter 2009 grew 15% driven by gains in fragrance, color cosmetics, and personal care of 11%, 27%, and 19%, respectively. On a local-currency basis, Beauty sales grew 9%, as fragrance, color

cosmetics, and personal care sales grew 7%, 19%, and 13%, respectively. Units sold increased 4% in the quarter, and beauty units were up 5% versus a year ago.
Commenting on the company's revenue growth, Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with Avon's performance in the fourth quarter. Against the backdrop of the global economic crisis, our growth strategy to leverage our smart-value product offering and Representative earnings opportunity paid off to deliver robust Active Representative growth and beauty market share gains in the quarter. We are especially pleased that revenue growth was broad-based across our geographic portfolio. Our Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe regions, when combined, represent 30% of fourth-quarter revenue and together grew more than 15% (17% in local currency), while Latin America delivered another quarter of double-digit growth."
Fourth-quarter 2009 gross margin of 62.7% was 30 basis points higher than that of the prior-year quarter. Strong manufacturing productivity gains, which include benefits from the company's Strategic Sourcing Initiative and strategic price increases, helped offset an estimated 140 basis points of unfavorable transaction-exchange impact on the fourth-quarter 2009 gross margin.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter rose as a percent of revenue by 70 basis points versus 2008's fourth quarter. This was due primarily to higher year-over-year costs to implement restructuring initiatives.
Advertising for the quarter was $109 million, up $9 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued support for the company's innovation pipeline. Avon invested an incremental $24 million in Sales Leadership and incentives to further improve its Representative Value Proposition (RVP).

In the fourth quarter, costs associated with the company's 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs were $34 million pretax, or $.06 per share. This compared with costs of $7 million, or $.01 per share, related to the company's 2005 restructuring program in the prior-year period.
Avon reaffirmed that its 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs, as well as its Product Line Simplification Program (PLS) and Strategic Sourcing Initiative (SSI), are on track and showing results. In 2010, the company is expecting to achieve $350 million and $75 million in annual savings from initiatives associated with the 2005 and the 2009 restructuring programs, respectively. In addition, beginning in 2010, Avon expects to achieve annual benefits in excess of $200 million from its PLS program and in excess of $250 million from SSI.
Fourth-quarter 2009 operating profit was $408 million compared with $372 million in the prior-year quarter. The company's fourth-quarter 2009 operating margin was 12.8%, compared with 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Costs to implement restructuring initiatives lowered 2009's operating margin by 110 basis points and lowered 2008's operating margin by 20 basis points. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange lowered operating margin by an estimated 90 basis points (approximately 160 of that from unfavorable foreign-exchange transaction offset by approximately 70 from favorable foreign-exchange translation) year over year.
The effective tax rate in the fourth-quarter 2009 was 30.8% compared with 2008's rate of 32.3%. The decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from one-time adjustments associated with tax refunds and changes in statutory tax rates.
Net income in the fourth-quarter 2009 was $269 million, or $0.62 per share, compared with $232 million, or $0.54 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

At year end, Avon's total debt had decreased by $42 million to $2.4 billion compared to year-end 2008, and cash had increased by $207 million to $1.3 billion, resulting in a reduction in our net debt (total debt less cash) of $249 million. Despite the challenging environment in 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was $782 million for the full year, compared with $748 million of cash provided by operating activities in the same period of 2008. Capital expenditures of $297 million in 2009 were at the lower range of the company's expectation of $300 - $325 million and well below the $381 million of capital expenditures the company incurred in 2008.
Regional Results
In Latin America, fourth-quarter 2009 revenue grew 29% (up 14% on a local-currency basis) compared to the fourth-quarter 2008, driven by local-currency sales growth of 12% in Brazil, 32% in Venezuela and 19% in Colombia. On a reported basis, revenue in these markets increased by 46%, 32%, and 38%, respectively. In Mexico, fourth-quarter local-currency sales decreased 2% (down 3% on a reported basis) as the difficult economic climate pressured results following local-currency revenue increases in each of the first three quarters of 2009. The region's Active Representatives grew 10% and units sold increased by 3%. Latin America's operating profit increased 33%, (up 12% in local currency) primarily due to higher sales. Fourth-quarter operating margin was 19%.
Fourth-quarter revenue in North America declined 7% (down 9% on a local-currency basis). Active Representatives increased 3% versus the prior-year quarter. Units sold were 7% lower versus the prior year. The region's revenue continued to be

pressured by lower consumer spending and nearly double-digit declines in non-Beauty sales (Fashion and Home categories). Operating profit decreased 14% (down 18% in local currency) versus the 2008 quarter, primarily due to lower revenue. The region's operating margin was 6%.
In Central and Eastern Europe, fourth-quarter 2009 revenue grew 12% (up 20% on a local-currency basis) compared with the fourth-quarter 2008, driven primarily by local-currency increases of 29% in Russia. On a reported basis, revenues in this market increased by 18%. For the region, fourth-quarter Active Representatives grew 15% and units sold increased 11%. The region's operating profit increased by 28% (up 34% in local currency) as leverage from higher sales offset unfavorable foreign-currency transaction exchange in the region. Operating margin was 24%.
In Western Europe, Middle East & Africa, fourth-quarter 2009 revenue grew 20% (up 12% in local currency) compared to the prior-year quarter, driven largely by local-currency sales growth of 39% in Turkey (up 43% on a reported basis). Revenue in the United Kingdom declined 3% in local currency, but was roughly flat on a reported basis compared to the prior-year quarter. The region's Active Representatives grew 17% and units sold increased 19% in the fourth-quarter 2009. Operating profit increased by 29% (up 13% in local currency), due to strong sales growth and expense controls. The region's operating margin was 12%.
In Asia Pacific, fourth-quarter revenue grew 13% (up 4% in local currency) compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by local-currency sales growth of 17% in the Philippines (20% on a reported basis), which more than offset double-digit local-currency declines in Japan. The region's Active Representatives grew 4% and units sold increased 7%. Fourth-quarter 2009 operating profit declined 12% (down 26% in
Avon -6
 
local currency) due primarily to costs to implement restructuring initiatives. Operating margin in the quarter was 10%.
Fourth-quarter 2009 revenue in China declined 8% versus the fourth-quarter 2008 with no impact from foreign exchange. Active Representatives rose 31% and revenue from Direct Sales increased 19% in the quarter. Revenue from Beauty Boutiques declined 66% in the quarter, reflecting the continued complex evolution towards direct selling in this hybrid business model unique to this market. Units sold decreased 1% versus the year-ago quarter. China had an operating loss of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus an operating profit of $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to higher investment in advertising and RVP.
Details of Full-Year 2009 Results
Full-year 2009 total revenue of $10.4 billion was 3% lower than that of 2008, but up 6% on a local-currency basis as foreign exchange pressured growth by 9 percentage points. Total beauty sales were down 3% but up 7% on a local-currency basis. Active Representatives grew 9% with growth in all regions. Units sold increased by 3% and Beauty units increased by 4% versus a year ago. Full-year advertising expense decreased by $38 million to $353 million as the company benefited from improved productivity and general softness in media prices while maintaining its advertising presence at a level similar to a year ago. Avon also invested an incremental $56 million for full-year 2009 to further improve its RVP. Costs associated with the company's 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs totaled $171 million pretax, or $0.32 per share. This

compared with costs of $61 million pretax, or $0.09 per share, related to the company's 2005 restructuring program in the prior-year period. Full-year net income was $626 million, or $1.45 per share, compared with $875 million, or $2.03 per share last year.
Andrea Jung, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "As we reflect on 2009, we believe that the growing momentum and strong finish to a very challenging year underscore the benefits of our advantaged business model and our proven ability to execute our turnaround strategies. Given this momentum, we enter 2010 with renewed confidence and a continuing committed focus on delivering long-term sustainable, profitable growth. In line with this, in 2010 we expect to realize further benefits and savings from our Product Line Simplification, Strategic Sourcing and restructuring initiatives, which give additional flexibility to further fuel reinvestment in top-line growth and continued product innovation.
"Overall, despite continuing economic uncertainties around the world and currency devaluation in Venezuela, our strong business fundamentals and momentum should continue," Ms. Jung added. "This bodes well for another year of at least mid-single digit local-currency revenue growth and operating margin improving on the way to reaching mid-teens levels by 2013."
Avon will conduct a conference call at 9:00 A.M. today to discuss the quarter's results.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with US GAAP, we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as "Local Currency," "Constant $," or "C$" growth. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact can be determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
