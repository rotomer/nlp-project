Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO, remarked "Avon delivered another healthy performance in the second quarter, including strong revenue growth fueled by continuing investments in our brand and our channel, in line with our long-term strategic growth plan. We are also very pleased with the improving operating margin and strong increase in earnings per share. In addition, we ended the quarter with improved operating cash flow resulting from our ongoing efforts in this area."
Avon's Beauty sales growth of 9% included gains in all categories: fragrance, color cosmetics, skin care and personal care grew 16%, 12%, 4% and 3%, respectively. Constant dollar growth of 7% in Beauty was driven by 15% growth in fragrances, 9% growth in color cosmetics, 2% growth in skin care and 1% growth in personal care.
Second-quarter 2010 gross margin of 63.5% was 120 basis points above that of the prior-year quarter. Excluding the impact of Venezuelan special items and restructuring costs, gross margin was up 260 basis points to 64.9%, due to benefits from strong manufacturing productivity gains, which include benefits from our Strategic Sourcing Initiative ("SSI"), and strategic price increases.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter declined as a percent of revenue by 150 basis points versus second quarter 2009 due to lower restructuring costs. Excluding restructuring costs and Venezuelan special items, it increased by 180 basis points due in part to higher advertising expense and costs associated with the company's internal FCPA investigation.
Advertising for the quarter was $97 million, up 19% from $82 million in last year's period driven by increases in Latin America. In constant dollars, advertising was up 13%. Investments in Representative Value Proposition grew somewhat ahead of sales with a continued commitment to our Sales Leadership programs and Internet enablement.

Second-quarter 2010 costs associated with the company's 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs were $11 million pre-tax, or $0.02 per share after-tax. This compared with costs of $89 million pre-tax, or $0.19 per share after-tax, related to the company's 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs in the prior-year period.
Second-quarter 2010 operating profit of $272 million rose 48% compared with the year-ago quarter and operating margin was 10.1%, an improvement of 270 basis points year over year. Excluding the impact of Venezuelan special items and restructuring costs, operating profit was up 16% and operating margin was 11.8% or up 80 basis points versus the second quarter of 2009.
Second-quarter 2010's effective tax rate was 33.5%, compared to 47.1% in second quarter 2009. Excluding the impact from Venezuelan special items and restructuring costs, the tax rate was 29.7% in second quarter 2010, compared to 32.8% in second quarter 2009.
Net income in the second quarter of 2010 was $168 million, or $0.39 per share, compared with $83 million, or $0.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter. After adjusting for the impact of Venezuelan special items and restructuring costs, net income was $209 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with $166 million, or $0.38 per share, in the year-ago second quarter.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $241 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared with $75 million of cash provided by operating activities in the same period of 2009.

Western Europe, Middle East & Africa's second-quarter revenue increased 18% versus the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by Turkey and South Africa, as well as the acquisition of Liz Earle Beauty Co. Limited, which contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth. On a reported basis, U.K. was down 4%, Turkey rose 32% and South Africa rose 94%. The region's constant dollar revenue increased by 19%, with a 1% decrease in the U.K., 27% increase in Turkey and 72% increase in South Africa. The region's Active Representatives grew 12% year over year and units sold increased 15%. Operating profit was up 353% versus the prior year quarter. Operating margin was 16.8%, up from 4.4% in the year-ago quarter. Second-quarter 2010 adjusted operating profit was up 109%. Adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, up 710 basis points versus last year's second quarter due to improved manufacturing productivity and higher sales growth with relatively lower overhead.
Asia Pacific's second-quarter revenue increased 8% year over year, or 1% in constant dollars. Strong growth of 14%, or 9% in constant dollars, in the Philippines offset continued softness in Japan. The region's Active Representatives and units sold were each up by 3%. Operating profit rose 123% versus the 2009 quarter. The region's operating margin was 11.3% versus 5.5% a year ago. The region's adjusted operating profit rose 9%. Adjusted operating margin was 11.2%, flat versus a year ago.
Second-quarter revenue in China decreased 32% year over year. Units sold decreased 46% and Active Representatives were down 18%. The region's revenues were negatively impacted by the company's continued transition away from a hybrid model to one which focuses on direct selling and deemphasizes retail. China had an operating loss of $2 million compared with $7 million in profit in last year's second quarter.

"Adjusted" items refer to financial results presented in accordance with US GAAP that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of Venezuelan special items and restructuring costs, as described below, under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with US GAAP, we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as Constant $ growth, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
We present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating profit, operating margin, earnings per share and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period to period basis, the impacts of 1) costs to implement ("CTI") restructuring initiatives and 2) costs and charges related to Venezuela being designated as a highly inflationary economy and the subsequent devaluation of its currency ("Venezuelan special items"). The Venezuelan special items include the impact on the Statement of Income caused by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables; deferred tax assets and liabilities; and

nonmonetary assets, such as inventory and prepaid expenses. For nonmonetary assets, the Venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical cost of the assets at the previous official exchange rate of 2.15 and the new official exchange rate of 4.30.
