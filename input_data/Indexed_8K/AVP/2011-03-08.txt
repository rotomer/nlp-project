(e) On March 2, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a form of Performance Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement ("PRSU Agreement") and a revised form of Retention Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement ("RSU Agreement") under the Avon Products, Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, pursuant to which the Company grants various awards to its named executive officers and other key employees, from time to time. Awards are settled in shares of Company stock although the Company retains the right to settle awards in cash equal to the fair market value of shares that otherwise would be paid.
Generally, any Performance Restricted Stock Unit awards ("PRSUs") granted under the PRSU Agreement vest 100% only upon the satisfaction of certain performance measures. Upon a grantee's voluntary departure or departure for cause from the Company, any outstanding PRSUs are automatically forfeited. In addition, upon a grantee's involuntary termination or retirement prior to January 1 of the year following the grant, any outstanding PRSUs are automatically forfeited. Upon a grantee's involuntary termination or retirement on or after January 1 of the year following the grant or upon a grantee's death or permanent disability, provided that the performance measures have been satisfied, any outstanding PRSUs would vest on a prorated basis and be settled on the third anniversary of the grant date. The grantee is not entitled to dividend equivalent rights.
Restricted Stock Unit awards ("RSUs") are awarded from time to time to encourage retention. RSUs granted under the RSU Agreement are subject to vesting provisions. Generally, RSUs vest 100% on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Upon a grantee's voluntary departure or departure for cause from the Company, any outstanding RSUs are automatically forfeited. Upon a grantee's permanent disability, 100% of any outstanding RSUs would vest and be settled on the original vesting date specified in the terms of the grant. Upon a grantee's death, 100% of any outstanding RSUs would vest and the grantee's estate would receive such settlement as soon as practicable after death. Upon a grantee's involuntary departure from the Company without cause, any outstanding RSUs would vest on a prorated basis to the last day worked and be settled as soon as practicable after the time of departure. Upon a grantee's retirement from the Company, any outstanding RSUs under the RSU Agreement are automatically forfeited. The grantee has dividend equivalent rights to receive dividends on the number of shares subject to the RSUs when and as dividends are paid.
The above summary is qualified by reference to the text of the PRSU Agreement and the RSU Agreement that are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

Date: March 8, 2011
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
1. . Pursuant to the provisions of its 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") has awarded you (the "Grantee") Performance Contingent Restricted Stock Units (the "PRSUs"), representing the right to receive in the future shares of Stock (the "Shares") as set forth in the Grantee's grant notification. These PRSUs are subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, as well as those terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, all of which are hereby incorporated by this reference. All capitalized terms used in this Performance Contingent Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this "Agreement") shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan unless otherwise defined herein.
Grant of Performance Contingent Restricted Stock Unit Award
2. . These PRSUs represent a right to receive Shares on the Settlement Date (as defined below) but do not represent a current interest in the Shares. If all the terms and conditions hereof and of the Plan are met, then the Grantee shall be issued Shares on the Settlement Date (or earlier as provided in this Agreement). In lieu of issuance of Shares, the Company reserves the right to instead make a cash payment to the Grantee equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares determined as of the Settlement Date (or earlier as provided in this Agreement). The Company is not liable for any decrease of value of the Company's Shares.
Nature of PRSUs; Issuance of Shares
3. . These PRSUs may not be sold, tendered, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered.
Restrictions on Transfer of PRSUs
4.
Vesting of PRSUs; Voting; Dividends
(a) Subject to Section 5, vesting of the PRSUs shall occur on the date set forth in the Grantee's grant notification (such date the "Vesting Date") and settlement shall occur on the third anniversary of the date of grant (the "Settlement Date"). Subject to Section 5, vesting and payment are contingent upon: (i) the Grantee being employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the Vesting Date; and (ii) satisfaction by the Company of performance measures set forth in the grant notification (the "Performance Measures").
(b) The Grantee does not have the right to vote any of the Shares or the right to receive dividends on them prior to the date such Shares are issued to the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof.
5.
Separation from Service
(a) . If the Grantee incurs an involuntary Separation from Service by the Company (and, if applicable, by any Subsidiary by whom the Grantee is employed) other than for Cause on or after January 1 of the year following the date of grant (the "Grant Date") and the Grantee will not be eligible for Retirement at the end of the salary continuation period for which the Grantee is eligible under a severance pay plan of the Company or some other agreement between the Grantee and the Company (as if the Grantee made any available election under such plan or agreement to extend the salary continuation period by the maximum period available to such Grantee), in either case as in effect on the date hereof (disregarding any election permitted to the Grantee under such plan or agreement), then, that the Company has satisfied the Performance Measures as of the Vesting Date, a pro-rata portion of the PRSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and the pro-rata number of such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee on the Settlement Date. The number of Shares that vest shall be determined by multiplying the full number of Shares subject to the PRSUs by a fraction, which shall be the number of complete months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the date of the Separation from Service (typically the last day of active employment), divided by the number of months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the Vesting Date.
Separation from Service by the Company without Cause
provided
(b) . If the Grantee incurs a voluntary Separation from Service due to Retirement on or after January 1 of the year following the Grant Date, or the Grantee incurs an involuntary Separation from Service by the Company (and, if applicable by any Subsidiary by whom the Grantee is employed) other than for Cause on or after January 1 of the year following the Grant Date and the Grantee will be eligible for Retirement at the end of the salary continuation period for which the Grantee is eligible under a severance pay plan of the Company or some other agreement between the Grantee and the Company (as if the Grantee made any available election under such plan or agreement to extend the salary continuation period by the maximum period available to such Grantee), in either case as in effect on the date hereof (disregarding any election permitted to the Grantee under such plan or agreement), then, that the Company has satisfied the Performance Measures as of the Vesting Date, a pro-rata portion of the PRSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above all become vested and the pro-rata number of such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee on the Settlement Date. The number of Shares that vest shall be determined by multiplying the full number of Shares subject to the PRSUs by a fraction, which shall be the number of complete months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the date of Separation from Service, divided by the number of months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the Vesting Date.
Separation from Service due to Retirement
provided
 
(c) . If the Grantee incurs a Separation from Service due to Disability, then, that the Company has satisfied the Performance Measures as of the Vesting Date, a pro-rata portion of the PRSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and the pro-rata number of such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee on the Settlement Date. The number of Shares that vest shall be determined by multiplying the full number of Shares subject to the PRSUs by a fraction, which shall be the number of complete months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the date of Separation from Service divided by the number of months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the Vesting Date.
Separation from Service due to Disability
provided
(d) . If the Grantee dies, then, that the Company has satisfied the Performance Measures as of the Vesting Date, a pro-rata portion of the PRSUs referred to in Section 4(a) above shall become vested and the pro-rata number of such vested Shares shall be issued to the Grantee on the Settlement Date. The number of Shares that vest shall be determined by multiplying the full number of Shares subject to the PRSUs by a fraction, which shall be the number of complete months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the date of death, divided by the number of months from the beginning of the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate to the Vesting Date.
Death
provided
(e) . All PRSUs are forfeited if the Grantee incurs a Separation from Service from the Company (and, if applicable, from any Subsidiary by whom the Grantee is employed) under any of the following conditions: (i) an involuntary Separation from Service by the Company for Cause prior to the Settlement Date; (ii) an involuntary Separation from Service by the Company other than for Cause prior to January 1 of the year following the Grant Date; (iii) a voluntary Separation from Service due to Retirement prior to January 1 of the year following the Grant Date; or (iv) a voluntary Separation from Service (excluding Retirement or Disability) at any time during the performance period to which the Performance Measures relate.
Separations from Service Causing Forfeiture
(f) . To the extent that a PRSU payment is a non-exempt amount payable under a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Code Section 409A) upon a Separation from Service (other than death), if the Grantee is a "specified employee" (as that term is defined in Code Section 409A and pursuant to procedures established by the Company) on the Grantee's Separation from Service, then any Shares (or cash in lieu thereof if the PRSUs are to be settled in cash) payable pursuant to the PRSU on account of the Separation from Service (other than death) will not be paid to the Grantee during the six-month period immediately following such Separation from Service. Instead, any Shares (or cash in lieu thereof if the PRSUs are to be settled in cash) that would have been payable to the Grantee on account of the Grantee's Separation from Service shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month following the Grantee's Separation from Service but not earlier than the Settlement Date.
Six-Month Wait under Code Section 409A
 
(g) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event of a Change in Control, the vesting and payment of PRSUs shall be governed by the provisions of the Plan regarding a Change in Control, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Change in Control
(h) . For purposes of determining the vesting of PRSUs under this Agreement, a paid or unpaid leave of absence of the Grantee shall not constitute a Separation from Service of the Grantee, except to the extent that such leave of absence constitutes a "separation from service" (as defined in Code Section 409A). During a paid or unpaid leave of absence, until a "separation from service" occurs, the PRSUs shall continue to vest as set forth in the grant notification referred to in Section 4(a) of this Agreement. The Grantee's employment by a Subsidiary shall be considered a Separation from Service on the date on which such Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary, that, in such event, any issuance of Shares to the Grantee pursuant to this Section 5 shall be made on the Settlement Date.
Paid or Unpaid Leave of Absence or Change in Subsidiary Status for Subsidiary Employing Grantee

(b) the Grantee shall not solicit or aid in the solicitation of any employees of the Company or any Subsidiary to leave their employment.
In addition, the Grantee shall not, unless compelled pursuant to an order of a court or other body having jurisdiction over such matter, communicate or divulge any secret or confidential information, knowledge or data, including without limitation any trade secrets, relating to the Company or a Subsidiary, and their respective businesses, obtained by the Grantee during his or her employment by the Company or a Subsidiary and which is not otherwise publicly known (other than by reason of an unauthorized act by the Grantee), to anyone other than the Company and those designated by it.
 
In the event the Company determines that the Grantee has breached any term of this Section 6 or any non-disclosure, non-compete or non-solicitation covenant set forth in his or her severance agreement, employment contract or any Company policy, in addition to any other remedies the Company may have available to it, unless otherwise determined by the Committee: (x) all unvested PRSUs granted hereunder shall be forfeited; (y) if Shares have been issued to the Grantee in respect of vested PRSUs hereunder, then the Grantee shall forfeit all such Shares so issued to the Grantee hereunder; and (z) if cash has been paid to the Grantee in lieu of Shares in respect of vested PRSUs hereunder, the Grantee shall pay to the Company all such cash so paid in lieu of Shares to the Grantee hereunder; , , that if the Grantee no longer holds Shares issued to the Grantee hereunder, the Grantee shall pay to the Company in cash the Fair Market Value of any such Shares on the date such Shares were issued to the Grantee hereunder.

7. . For those Grantees who are subject to the Company's Compensation Recoupment Policy, the PRSUs and the Shares issued (or if the Company elected to make a cash payment instead of Shares equal to the Fair Market of the Shares determined as of the Settlement Date (or earlier as provided in this Agreement), the cash payment) to the Grantee in respect of vested PRSUs hereunder are subject to the Company's Compensation Recoupment Policy, as it is amended from time to time.

(b) The award of the PRSUs hereunder does not entitle the Grantee to any benefit other than that specifically granted under this Agreement and under the Plan, nor to any future grants or other benefits under the Plan or any similar plan. Any benefits granted under this Agreement and under the Plan are not part of the Grantee's ordinary compensation, and shall not be considered as part of such compensation in the event of severance, redundancy or resignation. The Grantee understands and accepts that the benefits granted under the Plan are entirely at the grace and discretion of the Company and that the Company retains the right to amend or terminate the Plan, and/or the Grantee's participation therein, at any time, at the Company's sole discretion and without notice.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if, on the applicable Settlement Date or on any earlier date on which such taxes may be due, the delivery of Shares is not made because of Code Section 409A requirements or because the Grantee elects pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan to defer the delivery of any Shares payable hereunder or for some other reason, the Grantee hereby irrevocably elects to satisfy all applicable taxes due on the applicable Settlement Date or on any earlier date on which such taxes may be due with respect to such Shares for which delivery is being deferred by delivering cash to the Company in an amount sufficient to satisfy all such taxes.
Taxes
11. . To the extent that PRSUs are intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) or are subject to Code Section 409A, any provision, application or interpretation of this PRSU that is inconsistent with such Code Sections shall be disregarded with respect to such PRSU, as applicable. In no event shall the Company, any of its affiliates, any of its agents, or any member of the Board have any liability for any taxes imposed in connection with a failure of the Plan to comply with Code Section 409A.

For purposes of determining the vesting of RSUs under this Agreement, a paid or unpaid leave of absence of the Grantee shall not constitute a Separation from Service of the Grantee, except to the extent that such leave of absence constitutes a "separation from service" (as defined in Code Section 409A). During a paid or unpaid leave of absence, until a "separation from service" occurs, the RSUs shall continue to vest as set forth in the grant notification referred to in Section 4(a) of this Agreement. The Grantee's employment by a Subsidiary shall be considered a Separation from Service on the date on which such Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary, that, in such event, the calculation of vested Shares to the Grantee pursuant to this Section 5 shall be made on a pro-rata basis in accordance with Section 5(a) but payment shall not be made until the Vesting Date.
