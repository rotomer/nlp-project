INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 13, 2011, Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") announced that in 2012 the Company will separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and that Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and CEO, will be named Executive Chairman upon a new CEO joining the Company. A committee of the Board of Directors will work with Ms. Jung to undertake an external search for a CEO. Ms. Jung will continue to serve in her dual roles throughout the recruitment process and will work closely with the new CEO to assure a successful transition. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will enter into a two-year contract with Ms. Jung setting forth the role, responsibilities and compensation and benefits for the Executive Chairman position, which may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. The new two-year term of employment, together with the compensation and benefits for the Executive Chairman, will be effective upon the new CEO commencing employment with the Company. The Company expects to file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission later this week with respect to such contract.
