INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On
February 14, 2012
, Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the
fourth
quarter and full year
2011
. The press release included the Companys consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows, and supplemental schedules, for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended
December 31, 2011
. A copy of that press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments.
The press release discloses that the Company has recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 a non-cash impairment charge of $263 million ($166 million after tax), or $0.38 per diluted share, for goodwill and an indefinite-lived intangible asset related to Silpada Designs, Inc. ("Silpada"). During the year-end 2011 close process, the Company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments and subsequently determined that the goodwill and intangible asset associated with Silpada were impaired.
Following weaker than expected performance, in the fourth quarter the Company lowered its revenue and earnings projections for Silpada largely due to the rise in silver prices since the acquisition and the negative impact of pricing on revenues and margins.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

                
Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, N.Y., February 14, 2012 - Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2011 results. Andrea Jung, Avon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said: Despite a challenging fourth quarter, 2011 revenue was up 4% (1% in constant dollars) to $11.3 billion. Adjusted operating profit for the year was $1.16 billion and cash from operations was $656 million. While 2012 is a year of transition and we are not planning for margin recovery, our priorities are to improve top-line performance, cost management, and cash generation. Additionally, the company plans to maintain its annual $0.92 dividend in 2012. As previously announced, the company is conducting an operational and financial assessment of the business. We will update investors at the appropriate time after a new CEO is on board.

Fourth-Quarter 2011 (compared to fourth-quarter 2010)
Total revenue of $3.0 billion decreased 4% or 1% in constant dollars. Total units declined 2%, while price/mix was a benefit of 1% during the quarter. Active Representatives were down 3%.
Fourth-quarter 2011 gross margin was 61.1%, 70 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter primarily due to an inventory-related charge in Brazil and commodity cost pressures.
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased as a percent of revenue by 2% versus fourth-quarter 2010, and increased 3% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis due to higher distribution costs, bad debt expense, and investments in Representative Value Proposition (RVP). Avon invested an incremental $35 million in RVP in the fourth quarter of 2011 in Sales Leadership and higher incentives. This more than offset
a $21 million decline in advertising, which was down 23% to $71 million.
Fourth-quarter 2011 costs associated with the company's 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs were $9 million pre-tax, down from $58 million pre-tax, or $0.01 and $0.09 per diluted share, respectively.
During the quarter, the Company took a non-cash charge of $263 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, to adjust goodwill and an intangible asset related to the acquisition of Silpada Designs, Inc. (Silpada). This non-cash impairment charge was largely driven by the rise in silver prices since the acquisition and the negative impact on Silpada's revenues and margins.
Operating profit was $13 million in the quarter and operating margin was 0.4%, significantly impacted by the Silpada impairment charge. Adjusted non-GAAP operating profit was down 31%, and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 9.4%, down 360

basis points from a year ago due to higher field and distribution costs in Brazil, higher investments in RVP in the U.S., and lower gross margin.
Fourth-quarter 2011's effective tax rate was 101.7%, compared with 34.0% in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs and the Silpada impairment charge, the fourth-quarter 2011 adjusted non-GAAP tax rate was 32.2% versus 34.0% in fourth-quarter 2010.
Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.3 million or zero cents per diluted share, significantly impacted by the Silpada impairment charge. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs and the impairment charge, adjusted non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $172 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
Fourth-Quarter 2011 Regional Results (compared to fourth-quarter 2010)
Latin America's fourth-quarter 2011 revenue was up 2% year over year, or up 6% in constant dollars. Brazil was down 6%, or down 1% in constant dollars. Strong growth continued in Mexico, which was up 2%, or up 12% in constant dollars. The region's Active Representatives were flat and units sold increased 4%. Fourth-quarter operating profit was down 33%. Operating margin was 9.9%, or 10.4% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. The decline in operating margin was due to a $16 million inventory-related charge and the field and distribution costs associated with Brazil's continued service challenge. The final quarter of dual distribution costs were also a factor.
Fourth-quarter revenue in North America was down 7% on both a reported and constant-dollar basis. Avon's core U.S. business, which excludes Silpada, was down 5%, as recent product portfolio enhancements of giftables and smart-value offerings

within Beauty resulted in positive average order growth for the quarter, partially offsetting a decline in Active Representatives. Silpada sales were down double digits, negatively impacted by recent price increases. The region's Active Representatives were down 8% and units sold were flat. North America reported a fourth-quarter operating loss of $241 million, compared with an operating profit of $46 million in the year-ago quarter, due to the Silpada impairment charge. Excluding restructuring charges and the Silpada impairment charge, adjusted non-GAAP operating profit was down 69%, with an adjusted non-GAAP operating margin of 3.6%. The decline in adjusted non-GAAP operating margin reflects fixed overhead costs with lower revenues and costs related to the One Simple Sales Model implementation.
In Central & Eastern Europe, fourth-quarter revenue was down 9%, or down 8% in constant dollars. The region's results were pressured by a challenging beauty market as well as aggressive competitive pricing. Russia was down 11%, or down 10% in constant dollars.
The region's Active Representatives and units sold were down 3% and 12%, respectively. Operating profit was down 10%. The region's operating margin was 19.4%, or 19.8% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, as gains in gross margin were offset by investments in brochure and the impact of fixed overhead costs on lower revenues.
Western Europe, Middle East & Africa's fourth-quarter revenue decreased 9% or down 3% in constant dollars. The region's results reflect continued weakness in macroeconomic conditions and weaker performance in the Fashion & Home categories. The region's Active Representatives and units sold were down 3% and 5%, respectively. Operating profit was down 23% versus the prior-year quarter.
Operating margin was 11.0% and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 10.9%, primarily due to lower gross margin, negatively impacted by foreign exchange and fixed overhead costs with lower revenues.
Avon -5
Asia Pacific's fourth-quarter revenue was down 6% year over year, or down 7% in constant dollars. The region's Active Representatives and units sold declined 7% and 6%, respectively. Operating profit was down 24%. Operating margin was 9.5% and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 9.6%. The decline was due to fixed overhead costs with lower revenues and higher investments in RVP.
Full-Year 2011 Results (compared to full-year 2010)
Total revenue of $11.3 billion increased 4% or up 1% in constant dollars. Acquisitions contributed 1% to revenue growth during the year. Total Beauty sales were up 5%, or 2% on a constant-dollar basis. Active Representatives declined 1% and units sold were down by 2%.
Operating profit of $855 million decreased 20% and operating margin was 7.6%, down 230 basis points. Excluding the impact of restructuring costs and the Silpada impairment charge, adjusted non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, down 6%, and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 10.3%, down 110 basis points from a year ago.
Full-year income from continuing operations was $526 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared with $595 million, or $1.36 per diluted share last year. Adjusted non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $719 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared with $786 million, or $1.80 per diluted share.
Cash flow from operations was $656 million in 2011, $33 million lower, primarily due to a $75 million pension contribution, a $36 million payment associated with a long-term incentive compensation plan, and higher restructuring payments during the year. Partially offsetting these items were higher cash net income from operations and higher
Avon -6
recovery of value added taxes in Brazil. Avon's net debt (total debt less cash) at year-end 2011 was $2.1 billion, up $107 million from the prior-year period. Capital expenditures were $277 million for the year.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as Constant $ growth, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
We present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating profit, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of 1) costs to implement (CTI) restructuring initiatives, 2) goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charge related to Silpada ("Impairment charge"), and 3) costs and charges related to Venezuela being designated as a highly inflationary economy and the subsequent devaluation of its currency in January 2010 (Venezuelan special items). The Company believes investors find the non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period. The Impairment charge includes the impact on the Statement of Income caused by the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charge related to Silpada in 2011. The Venezuelan special items include the impact on the Statement of Income caused by the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities, such as cash, receivables and payables; deferred tax assets and liabilities; and nonmonetary assets, such as inventory and prepaid expenses. For nonmonetary assets, the Venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical cost of the assets at the previous official exchange rate of 2.15 and the revised official exchange rate of 4.30.
