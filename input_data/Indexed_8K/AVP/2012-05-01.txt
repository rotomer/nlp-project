EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, N.Y., May 1, 2012 - Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported first-quarter 2012 results. Kimberly Ross, Avon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said: While our first
-
quarter operating performance remained challenged, we are making progress toward addressing some of our operational and cost
-
cutting opportunities. With Sheri McCoy now on board, we are confident that her broad leadership experience and skills in managing large, complex, global organizations will help drive Avon's future success. We look forward to communicating further with investors about our future growth strategy at the appropriate time.
First-Quarter
2012
(compared with
first-quarter
2011
)
Total revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 2%, up 1% in constant dollars. Total units declined by 1% and price/mix increased 2% during the quarter. Active Representatives were down 2%.
On a category basis, Beauty sales declined 1%, up 2% in constant dollars. On a reported basis, color was flat, fragrance and skincare declined 1%, and personal care was down 2%. Constant-dollar Beauty was driven by growth in all categories; color was up 4%, fragrance increased 3%, skincare grew 2%, and personal care was up 1%.
First-quarter 2012 gross margin was 60.8%, 310 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to cost pressures, including commodities and higher labor costs, as well as the negative impact from both foreign exchange and product mix.
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased as a percent of revenue by 350 basis points versus first-quarter 2011, and increased 310 basis points on an adjusted non-GAAP basis largely due to investments in the Representative Value

(RVP), increased bad debt provisions in South Africa, higher employment costs, and increased investments in brochures. Avon invested an additional $29 million in RVP in the quarter, primarily in the One Simple Sales Model in the U.S. and an increased focus on Representative engagement in Brazil. This was partially offset by a $7 million decline in advertising, down 9% to $75 million.
In the quarter, we took actions to enhance our operating model, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies. We recorded costs associated with restructuring of $27 million pre-tax, up from $15 million pre-tax in the year-ago period, or $0.04 and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively. Of the $27 million in the quarter, $22 million relates to the actions as described above, with the remaining $5 million associated with the 2005 and 2009 restructuring programs.
Operating profit was $72 million in the quarter and operating margin was 2.8%. Adjusted non-GAAP operating profit was $99 million and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 3.8%, down 610 basis points from the first quarter of 2011.
First-quarter 2012's effective tax rate was 32.3%, in line with the first quarter of 2011. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 32.9% versus 32.8% in first-quarter 2011.
Income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2012 was $28 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. Adjusted non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $46 million, or $0.10 per diluted share.
With regards to cash flow, operating activities used $33 million of cash during the first quarter compared with a use of $32 million in the first quarter of 2011, as lower net income was offset by improvements in working capital, including inventory and lower pension contributions. The overall net cash used in the first quarter was $30 million, compared with a use of $165 million in first-quarter 2011, primarily due to lower debt repayments and $44 million related to the termination of two of our interest rate swap agreements.
Avon's net debt (total debt less cash) for the first quarter of 2012 was $2.2 billion, up $104 million from the year-end level.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as Constant $ growth, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
We present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating profit, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of costs to implement (CTI) restructuring initiatives. The Company believes investors find the non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period.
