EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, N.Y., August 1, 2012 - Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported second-quarter 2012 results. Avon's second-quarter financial results are not good and they reflect the complex challenges that Avon faces. We are working to stabilize the top-line, improve cost structure and cash generation, and instill a more disciplined culture of accountability, said Sheri McCoy, Avon's Chief Executive Officer. We will also put the consumer and Representative back at the center of our business and ensure our associates are engaged and aligned. It will take time, but I am confident that we can turn the business around and reach a point of sustainable growth.
Second-Quarter
2012
(compared with
second-quarter
2011
)
Total revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 9%, or down 1% in constant dollars. Total units declined by 4% and price/mix increased 3% during the quarter. Active Representatives were down 3%.
Avon Beauty sales declined 9%, or were flat in constant dollars. On a reported basis, fragrance was down 8%, color was down 9%, and skincare and personal care both declined by 10%. On a constant-dollar basis, fragrance increased 1%, color was flat, and skincare and personal care were both down 1%.
Second-quarter 2012 gross margin was 62.8%, 160 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter, due to higher product costs impacted by inflationary pressures, as well as negative impact from foreign exchange.
Selling, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased as a percent of revenue by 460 basis points versus second-quarter 2011, or 350 basis points on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, due to lower revenues while continuing to incur overhead expenses that

do not vary directly with revenue, higher professional fees and wage inflation. Negative impacts of foreign exchange and an increased investment in brochures were also factors. This was offset by a $24 million decline in advertising, down 29% to $58 million, and a $4 million decrease in Representative Value Proposition
2
(RVP).
In the quarter, the Company took further action to enhance its operating model, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies. The Company recorded costs associated with restructuring of $38 million pre-tax, up from $12 million pre-tax in the year-ago period, or $0.06 and $0.02 per diluted share, respectively.
Operating profit was $127 million in the quarter and operating margin was 4.9%. Adjusted non-GAAP operating profit was $165 million and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin was 6.4%, down 510 basis points from the second quarter of 2011.
Second-quarter 2012's effective tax rate was 30.9%, versus 28.9% in the second quarter of 2011. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 31.2%, versus 29.1% in the second-quarter 2011, due primarily to lower benefits from audit settlements and statute expirations.
Income from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2012 was $63 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $89 million, or $0.20 per diluted share.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $41 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared with $101 million in the same period of 2011, as lower net income was partially offset by improvements in working capital, lower contributions to the U.S. pension plan, and a payment in 2011 associated with a long-term incentive compensation plan. The overall net cash generated in the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $31 million, compared with a use of $169 million for the same period in 2011, primarily due to lower debt repayments.
Avon's net debt (total debt less cash) for the second quarter of 2012 was $2.3 billion, up $194 million from the year-end level, primarily due to a new term loan in the amount of $500 million in the quarter, partially offset by commercial paper repayments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to these adjusted growth rates as Constant $ growth, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
We present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, net global expenses, operating profit, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of costs to implement (CTI) restructuring initiatives. The Company believes investors find the non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period.
