INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT
Item 1.01
    
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously disclosed, given the non-cash charge of $263.0 million that Avon Products, Inc. (the "Company") recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 to adjust goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its Silpada business ("Silpada Non-Cash Charge"), the Company entered into a letter agreement with the holders of privately placed notes (the Noteholders) issued by the Company under a Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 23, 2010 (the Agreement), pursuant to which the Company agreed, among other things, to amend the Agreement. Accordingly, on August 15, 2012, the Company and the Noteholders entered into the First Amendment to Note Purchase Agreement (the Amendment). The Amendment provides the following key terms:
a leverage ratio covenant;
a most favored lender provision;
a 150 basis point step up of the applicable coupon if the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated debt is not rated above investment grade by a certain number of rating agencies;
a covenant that, if requested by the Noteholders, the Company arrange a quarterly call among the Noteholders and the Company's Chief Financial Officer and/or Treasurer; and
an amendment to the interest coverage ratio to allow the Company, subject to certain conditions, to add back to the Company's consolidated pre-tax income actual non-cash impairment charges related solely to the Silpada business in an amount not to exceed $125,000,000 in the aggregate (in addition to the Silpada Non-Cash Charge) during the term of the Agreement.
Certain of the Noteholders or their affiliates provide or have provided certain insurance-related and administrative services to the Company.
The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Amendment, and reference is made to the complete text of the Amendment, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.

EXHIBIT INDEX
 

FIRST AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, is dated as of August 15, 2012 (this
Amendment
), between AVON PRODUCTS, INC., a New York corporation (the
Company
), and each of the institutions signatory to this Amendment (collectively, the
Noteholders
).
Recitals:
A.
    
The Company and each of the Noteholders have entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 23, 2010 (the
Note Purchase Agreement
). In connection therewith, the Company issued (a) $142,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.60% Senior Notes, Series A, due November 23, 2015, (b) $290,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.03% Senior Notes, Series B, due November 23, 2020 and (c) $103,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.18% Senior Notes, Series C, due November 23, 2022 ((a) through (c), collectively referred to as the
Notes
) pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Noteholders are the holders of 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the definitions assigned to them in the Note Purchase Agreement.
B.
    
Pursuant to a Letter Waiver (as defined below), the Required Holders waived the requirement that the Company include in the calculation of Interest Coverage Ratio the Silpada Non-cash Charge (as defined below) and permitted the Company, solely for the calculation of the Interest Coverage Ratio as of September 30, 2012, to add back to the consolidated pre-tax income of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries the Silpada Non-cash Charge, thereby waiving a potential violation of Section 10.1 of the Note Purchase Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, upon the full and complete satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this Amendment set forth in Section 3 hereof, and in consideration of good and valuable consideration (including the Required Holders executing the Letter Waiver), the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Noteholders do hereby agree as follows:
In accordance with Section 17.1 of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreement shall be and is hereby amended as follows:
Section 1.1.
    
A new Section 7.4 shall be added after Section 7.3 of the Note Purchase Agreement as follows:
Section 7.4
    
Quarterly call with holders of Notes. The Company shall arrange, if requested by any holder of the Notes, a quarterly call among the holders of the Notes and the Chief Financial Officer and/or the Treasurer of the Company.
Section 1.2.
    
A new Section 9.9 shall be added after Section 9.8 of the Note Purchase Agreement as follows:
Section 9.9
    
Downgrade. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Note Purchase Agreement, the form of Notes or the Notes to the contrary, if the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated Debt is (A) not rated above Investment Grade by (i) two or more of the Rating Agencies if such Debt is rated by the three Rating Agencies, or (ii) one Rating Agency if such Debt is rated by two or less than two Rating Agencies or (B) not rated by any of the Rating Agencies (either (A) or (B) being a 
Downgrade Event
), then the applicable interest rates on each of the Notes shall immediately and automatically (without further action) increase by 1.50% per annum. Such increase shall be effective as of the date the Downgrade Event occurred. For clarification, if the Default Rate is in effect during the continuance of a Downgrade Event, then such rate shall be 1.50% per annum above the Default Rate, effective as of the date the Downgrade Event occurred. If after an increase in the interest rate of the Notes a Rating Agency rates the Company's unsecured and unsubordinated Debt Investment Grade such that such Debt is then rated Investment Grade by two or more of the Rating Agencies (if such Debt is rated by the three Rating Agencies) or all Rating Agencies (if such Debt is rated by two or less than two Rating Agencies) (an 
Investment Grade Event
), the interest rate on the Notes will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Notes on the date of their issuance or the Default Rate, if then in effect. Such decrease shall be effective as of the date the Investment Grade Event occurred. The Company will, within ten Business Days after any Responsible Officer has knowledge of the occurrence of a Downgrade Event or an Investment Grade Event, give written notice of such Downgrade Event or Investment Grade Event (and the exact date of such occurrence) to each holder of Notes that is an Institutional Investor.
Section 1.3.
    
A new Section 10.7 shall be added after Section 10.6 of the Note Purchase Agreement as follows:
Section 10.7
    
Leverage Ratio. The Company will not permit, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company, the ratio of (i) Consolidated Funded Debt on such date to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the period of four fiscal quarters ending on such date (the 
Leverage Ratio
), to be greater than the applicable ratio set forth in the grid below:
- 2 -
Section 1.4.    A new Section 10.8 shall be added after Section 10.7 of the Note Purchase Agreement as follows:
Section 10.8
    
Most Favored Lender Provision.
(a)
    
If at any time a Principal Credit Facility contains a Financial Covenant that is not contained in this Agreement or a Financial Covenant that is contained in this Agreement which would in any respect be more beneficial to the holders of Notes than the Financial Covenants set forth in this Agreement (any such provision, a 
More Favorable Financial Covenant
), then the Company shall provide a Financial Covenant Notice (as defined below) in respect of such More Favorable Financial Covenant. Thereupon, unless waived in writing by the Required Holders within ten Business Days after each holder's receipt of such notice, such More Favorable Financial Covenant shall be deemed automatically incorporated (without further action) by reference into this Agreement, mutatis mutandis, as if set forth in full herein, effective as of the date when such More Favorable Financial Covenant shall have become effective under such Principal Credit Facility. Any More Favorable Financial Covenant incorporated into this Agreement (herein referred to as an 
Incorporated Provision
) pursuant to this Section 10.8: (i) shall remain unchanged herein notwithstanding any waiver of the requirement to comply with such More Favorable Financial Covenant under the applicable Principal Credit Facility; provided, however, that if the Required Banks under the Credit Agreement referenced in clause (a) of the definition of Bank Credit Agreement in Schedule B of this Agreement (the 
Revolving Facility
) waive compliance with Section 7.02(d) thereof prior to a default or event of default thereunder to allow all or any portion of the Additional Silpada Charges to be excluded from the Interest Coverage Ratio calculation pursuant to the Revolving Facility, such a waiver shall be effective vis--vis this Agreement up to such charges but in no event shall such charges be in excess of, the maximum permitted Additional Silpada Charges, (ii) shall be deemed automatically amended, restated, replaced or modified herein to reflect any subsequent amendments, restatements, replacements or modifications made to such More Favorable Financial Covenant under the applicable Principal Credit Facility (provided that, if a Default or Event of Default then exists, such Incorporated Provision shall only be deemed automatically amended, restated, refinanced, replaced or modified at such time, if it should occur, when such Default or Event of Default no longer exists), and (iii) shall be deemed automatically deleted from this Agreement at such time as such More Favorable Financial Covenant is deleted or otherwise removed from the applicable Principal Credit Facility or such applicable Principal Credit Facility shall be terminated and no amounts shall be outstanding thereunder (provided that, if a Default or Event of Default then exists, such Incorporated Provision shall only be deemed automatically deleted from this Agreement at such time, if it should occur, when such Default or Event of Default no longer exists); provided further, in no event shall the Interest Coverage Ratio and the Leverage Ratio be less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the Interest Coverage Ratio contained in the Note Purchase Agreement and the Leverage Ratio described in Section 10.7, in each case, as of the date of this Amendment. In the event that any compensation shall have been paid to the creditors under a Principal Credit Facility in order to exclude, terminate, amend, restate, replace, loosen or modify any More Favorable Financial Covenant as set forth in such Principal Credit Facility, then a corresponding and pro rata payment of compensation shall be made to the holders of Notes in connection with the exclusion, termination, amendment, restatement, replacement, loosening or modification of such More
- 3 -
Favorable Financial Covenant hereunder based on the respective outstanding principal amount of Notes of each holder at such time (other than a waiver or amendment referred to in the proviso in clause (i) above or an amendment to that effect so long as the sum of the pro rata compensation paid to the creditors with respect to (A) such waiver or amendment plus (B) the Bank Waiver Letter, is equal to or less than 10 basis points (i.e., the fees paid to the holders of the Notes pursuant to the Letter Waiver). An amount equal to any compensation in excess of 10 basis points shall be made pro rata to the holders of the Notes based on the principal amount of the Notes outstanding at the time of effectiveness of such waiver or amendment. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, compensation shall in all cases be expressed in basis points only and resulting dollar amounts paid or to be paid shall be disregarded). Upon the request of the Company or any holder of a Note, the parties hereto shall enter into any additional agreement or amendment to this Agreement reasonably requested by any such party evidencing any of the foregoing.
(b)
    
For the purposes of the foregoing paragraph (a), the following terms have the following meanings:
(i)
    
Financial Covenant
 means any covenants (however expressed) and related definitions requiring the Company and/or its Consolidated Subsidiaries to meet specified thresholds of financial performance or financial condition (whether expressed in ratios or as fixed thresholds in respect of future financial performance or condition) including without limitation, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the Leverage Ratio and those which are expressed as events of default or mandatory prepayment provisions.
(ii)
    
Financial Covenant Notice
 means, in respect of any More Favorable Financial Covenant, a written notice to each of the holders of the Notes delivered promptly, and in any event with ten Business Days after the inclusion of such More Favorable Financial Covenant in any Principal Credit Facility (including by way of an amendment, restatement, replacement, or other modification of any existing provision thereof) from a Senior Financial Officer of the Company referring to the provisions of this Section 10.8 and setting forth a reasonably detailed description of such More Favorable Financial Covenant (including any defined terms used therein), as applicable.
