ARTICLE III:
The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,525,000,000 shares, divided into two classes consisting of 1,500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.25 per share (the Common Stock), and 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the Preferred Stock).
The shares of authorized Common Stock of the Corporation shall be identical in all respects and shall have equal rights and privileges.
The Board of Directors shall have authority by resolution to issue the shares of Preferred Stock from time to time on such terms as it may determine and to divide the Preferred Stock into one or more classes or series and, in connection with the creation of any such class or series, to determine and fix by the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares thereof the designation, powers and relative participating, optional, or other special rights of such class or series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by law.
The holders of capital stock of the Corporation shall not have any preemptive rights.
ARTICLE IIIA:
Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock:
Section 1.
Designation and Amount
. The shares of such series shall be designated as Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock) and the number of shares constituting the Series B Preferred Stock shall be 2,000,000. Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Series B Preferred Stock.
Section 2.
Dividends and Distributions
.
(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $0.25 per share (the Common Stock), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of share of Series B Preferred Stock, in an
Page 3 of 8
amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $10 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $10 per share on the Series B Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed
Page 4 of 8
for the payment thereof.
Section 3.
Voting Rights
. The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series B Preferred Stock Shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Amendment creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
Section 4.
Certain Restrictions
.
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution
Page 5 of 8
or winding up) with the Series B Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series B Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock; or
(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
Section 5.
Reacquired Shares
. Any shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation or in any other Certificate of Amendment creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
Section 6.
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment provided that the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of
Page 6 of 8
shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series B Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series B Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 7.
Consolidation, Merger, etc
. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Section 8.
No Redemption
. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
Section 9.

Section 10.
Amendment
.

Page 7 of 8
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.
ARTICLE IV:
The office of the Corporation is to be located in the City and County of New York, State of New York.

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20). The number of directors to be chosen within said maximum and minimum limits shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the By-Laws.
Directors shall be elected annually at the annual meeting of shareholders, each to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting or until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Any vacancies in the Board of Directors, by reason of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise, shall be filled solely by the Board of Directors, by majority vote of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, and any director so elected shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting of shareholders. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.
Any director may be removed from office as a director but only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
The directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation.
        
ARTICLE VI:
Except as otherwise required by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Article VI, a majority of the votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted for a director's election exceeds 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director.

Page 8 of 8
ARTICLE VIII:
No person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall have personal liability to the Corporation or its shareholders for damages for any breach of duty in such capacity, provided that the foregoing shall not limit the liability of any such person (i) if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to him establishes that his acts or omissions were in bad faith or involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or that he personally gained, in fact, a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not legally entitled or that his acts violated Section 719 of the Business Corporation Law of New York or, (ii) for any act or omission occurring prior to the adoption of this Article VIII. No amendment to or repeal of this Article VIII shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any such person to the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such person occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. If the Business Corporation Law of New York is amended hereafter to expand or limit the liability of a director, then the liability of a person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be deemed to be expanded to the extent required or limited to the extent permitted by the Business Corporation Law of New York, as so amended.

close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting.

In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for considering such business at the meeting and
any material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made and (ii) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (A) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, and (B) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the presiding officer of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9 and, if any proposed business is not in compliance with this Section 9, to declare that such proposal shall be disregarded.
(d)
    
For purposes of this Section 9, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
(e)
    
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.

right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor), including an action by or in the right of any other corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, which any director, officer or employee of the corporation served in any capacity at the request of the corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity, against judgments, fines, including excise taxes, amounts paid in settlement and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with any such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein,
provided
that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of such person if a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that
(i)
his acts
Page 17 of 19
were committed in bad faith or were the result of his active or deliberate dishonesty and were material to such action or proceeding or
(ii)
he personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not legally entitled.
(b)
    
The corporation shall indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of any other corporation of any type or kind, domestic or foreign, or of any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against amounts paid in settlement and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with such action, or any appeal therein,
provided
that no indemnification may be made to or on behalf of such person if
(i)
his acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of his active and deliberate dishonesty and were material to such action or
(ii)
he personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to which he was not legally entitled.
(c)
    
The termination of any civil or criminal action or proceeding by judgment, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
, or its equivalent, shall not in itself create a presumption that any such person has not met the standard of conduct set forth in this Section 1.
Section 2.
Payment of Indemnification; Repayment
.
(a)
    
A person who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding of the character described in Section 1 of this Article shall be entitled to indemnification as authorized in such Section.
(b)
    
Any indemnification under Section 1 of this Article, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the corporation in such manner as provided by law.
(c)
    
Expenses incurred by a person referred to in Section 1 of this Article in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount in case he is ultimately found, in accordance with this Article, not to be entitled to indemnification or, where indemnity is granted, to the extent the expenses so paid exceed the indemnification to which he is entitled.

Such person's expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of expenses under Section 2(c) of this Article where the required undertaking has been received by the corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 of this Article, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation to have made a determination that indemnification of the claimant is proper, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the corporation that indemnification of the claimant is not proper, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not entitled to indemnification.
Section 4.
Survival; Savings Clause; Preservation of Other Rights
.
(a)
    
The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each person who serves in such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions of the New York Business Corporation Law are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any state of facts then or previously existing or
any action or proceeding previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such a contract right may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such person.
(b)
    
If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each such person against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with any actual or threatened action by or in the right of the corporation, or any appeal therein, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.
(c)
    
The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee of the corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The corporation is hereby authorized to provide further indemnification if it deems it
Page 19 of 19
advisable by resolution of shareholders or directors, by amendment of these by-laws or by agreement.
