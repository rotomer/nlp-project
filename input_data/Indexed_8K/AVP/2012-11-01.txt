EXHIBIT INDEX
 

Exhibit 99.1
NEW YORK, N.Y., November 1, 2012 - Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) today reported third-quarter 2012 results and provided goals for future performance. Avon's third-quarter results remain disappointing. The challenges that Avon faces developed over time, not overnight, and it will take time to implement the solutions as well," said Sheri McCoy, Chief Executive Officer. However, we have identified the first critical actions to return Avon to a position of financial health and improve our competitive position. With a clear focus on growing the top-line, managing costs, and improving our working capital, I am confident that we are moving Avon toward a steady recovery."
Third-Quarter

On a constant-dollar basis, fragrance increased 2% while color and skincare declined 1% and 3%, respectively. Personal care was flat.

Third-quarter 2012 gross margin was 61.2%, 270 basis points lower than the prior-year quarter, due to the net unfavorable impact of product mix and pricing, higher supply chain costs primarily due to costs associated with obsolescence as well as the negative impact from foreign exchange
.
Operating profit was $106 million in the quarter and operating margin was 4.2%. Adjusted Non-GAAP operating profit was $152 million and adjusted Non-GAAP operating margin was 5.9%, down 440 basis points from the third quarter of 2011. The decline was due to lower gross margin and increases in overhead costs, primarily due to higher employee compensation costs. The negative impact of foreign exchange was also a factor. This was offset by an $18 million decline in advertising, down 24% to $58 million.
Based on the continued decline in revenue performance in China and corresponding lowering of our long-term growth estimates, we completed an interim impairment assessment of the fair value of goodwill related to the business, which resulted in a Q3 non-cash impairment charge of $44 million, or $0.10 per share.
Third-quarter 2012's effective tax rate was 58.2%, versus 31.5% in the third quarter of 2011. The tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 21.0 points from the goodwill impairment charge related to our operations in China, for which no tax benefit was recorded. On an adjusted Non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 37.2%, versus 31.5% in the third-quarter 2011, due primarily to lower benefits from audit settlements and statute expirations.
Income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2012 was $33 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Adjusted Non-GAAP income from continuing operations was $78 million, or $0.17 per diluted share.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $220 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared with $247 million in the same period of 2011, as lower net income was partially offset by improvements in working capital, lower contributions to the U.S. pension plan, and a payment in 2011 associated with a long-term incentive compensation plan of $36 million. The overall net cash used in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $148 million, compared with a use of $192 million for the same period in 2011, primarily due to lower capital expenditures.
Avon's net debt (total debt less cash) for the third quarter of 2012 was $2.2 billion, up $152 million from the year-end level.
Goals for Future Performance
Management is focused on stabilizing the business and returning Avon to sustainable growth and has set financial goals of mid single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and a low double-digit operating margin over the next three years. Management has the team fully aligned around actions that will accelerate top-line growth, reduce costs and improve working capital. Management is also targeting cost savings of at least $400 million by the end of the three years to be largely driven by a reduction in Selling, General and Administrative expenses (SG&A). It also expects that there will be charges associated with the achievement of these goals.
Earlier today, the company announced a reduction in its quarterly dividend from $.23 per share to $.06 per share. This is part of an overall review of the capital structure and is consistent with prior communication that the company would assess the dividend in light of current operating performance as well as Avon's peer group. This dividend reduction, in conjunction with continued efforts to improve working capital, should help provide financial flexibility.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, including revenue growth, operating profit, adjusted Non-GAAP operating profit, operating margin, and adjusted Non-GAAP operating margin. We refer to these adjusted financial measures as Constant $ items, which are Non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide investors an additional perspective on trends. To exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars, we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate. Currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.
We also present gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, net global expenses, operating profit, operating margin, income from continuing operations, earnings per share from continuing operations and effective tax rate on a Non-GAAP basis. The discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a Non-GAAP basis. We have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the Non-GAAP financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses the Non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of, on a period-to-period basis, the impacts of costs to implement (CTI) restructuring initiatives, and the goodwill impairment and intangible asset
charge related to China ("Impairment charge"). The Company believes investors find the Non-GAAP information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the Company's financial results in any particular period. The Impairment charge includes the impact on the Statement of Income caused by the goodwill impairment and intangible asset
charge related to China in 2012.
These Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
