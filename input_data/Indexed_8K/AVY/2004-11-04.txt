ITEM 8.01. Other Events.
 
In the course of Avery Dennison Corporation's (the "Company") internal examination of matters pertinent to the European Commission's (EC) investigation of anticompetitive activities affecting the European paper and forest products sector, the Company discovered instances of improper conduct by certain employees in its European operations. This conduct violated the Company's policies and in some cases constituted an infringement of EC competition law. As a result, the Company expects that the EC will fine the Company when its investigation is completed. The EC has wide discretion in fixing the amount of a fine, up to a maximum fine of 10 percent of a company's annual revenue. Because the Company is unable to estimate either the timing or the amount or range of any fine, the Company has made no provision for a fine in its financial statements. However, the Company believes that the fine could well be material in amount. There can be no assurance that additional adverse consequences to the Company will not result from the conduct discovered by the Company or other matters under EC or other laws. The Company is cooperating with authorities, continuing its internal examination, and taking remedial actions.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
