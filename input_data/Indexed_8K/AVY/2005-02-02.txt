This letter is written to advise you that the Compensation and Executive Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has designated you as a Participant under the Plan.
 
As an inducement for you to remain in the service of the Company, and to provide you with additional incentive to further the growth, development and financial success of the Company, the Company hereby agrees to provide you with a Benefit which, subject to the terms of the Plan and those set forth below, shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of an annual payment of a straight life annuity with payments commencing as described below and each payment equal to the excess of fifty-seven and one-half percent (57.5%) of your Average Compensation over the total of the offsets numbered (1), (2), (3) and (4) below.
