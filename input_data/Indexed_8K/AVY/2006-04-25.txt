"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Certain statements contained in this report on Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 are "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results and trends may differ materially from historical or expected results depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions; foreign exchange rates; worldwide and local economic conditions; selling prices; impact of legal proceedings, including the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") criminal investigation, as well as the European Commission ("EC"), Canadian Department of Justice, and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigations, into industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof (including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation, as well as a likely fine by the EC in respect of certain employee misconduct in Europe); impact of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in China; impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the Company's customers and suppliers; successful integration of acquired companies, financial condition and inventory strategies of customers; development, introduction and acceptance of new products; fluctuations in demand affecting sales to customers; and other matters referred to in the Company's SEC filings.
The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the near-term include (1) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and/or investigations regarding competitive activities, including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; (2) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the Company's products; (3) the impact of competitors' actions, including expansion in key markets, product offerings and pricing; (4) the degree to which higher raw material costs can be passed on to
 
customers through selling price increases (and previously implemented selling price increases can be sustained), without a significant loss of volume; and (5) ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions.
For a more detailed discussion of these and other factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Company's Form 10-K, filed on March 15, 2006. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 8-K are made only as of the date of this Form 8-K, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Exhibit 99.1
          PASADENA, Calif.  April 25, 2006  Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.69, compared with $0.57 per share for the first quarter of 2005. The increase in earnings reflected improvements in the Company's gross profit margin and operating expense ratio, as well as the benefit from an anticipated reduction in its tax rate relative to the same quarter last year.
          In both years, first quarter results included restructuring and asset impairment charges and a net loss from discontinued operations; 2005 results also included a gain on sale of assets and transition costs related to a plant closure. The net effect of these items totaled approximately $0.06 per share in 2006 and $0.05 per share in the prior year. Excluding these items, first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 21 percent over the same quarter last year. (
See Attachment A-3: "Preliminary Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures".)
          "We delivered outstanding profit improvement this quarter, and are on track to achieve the savings we targeted from our cost reduction actions," said Dean A. Scarborough, president and chief executive officer of Avery Dennison. "Our employees are doing a tremendous job improving the profitability of our businesses, while maintaining their focus on innovation and top-line growth.
          "Underlying unit volume growth improved sequentially," added Scarborough. "We anticipate further improvement in unit volume growth through the balance of the year. In particular, with pricing actions largely behind us, we expect our service and product advantages to once again drive share gain domestically for our roll materials business.
          "We remain focused on our key strategic growth platforms," said Scarborough. "We expect that emerging markets will continue to provide solid growth, and our expansion efforts in radio frequency identification (RFID), roll label materials for the beverage market, the Retail Information Services business, and numerous other Horizon growth initiatives will deliver on their potential."
