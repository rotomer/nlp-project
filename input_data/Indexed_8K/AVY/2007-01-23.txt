"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Certain statements contained in this report on Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2 are "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements and financial or other business targets are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results and trends may differ materially from historical or expected results depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions; foreign currency exchange rates; worldwide and local economic conditions; impact of competitive products and pricing; selling prices; impact of legal proceedings, including the Canadian Department of Justice and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigations into industry competitive practices, and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter thereof or of the recently concluded investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and European Commission (including purported class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, and purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation), as well as impact of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in China; impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the Company's customers and suppliers; successful integration of acquisitions; financial condition and inventory strategies of customers; timely development and market acceptance of new products; fluctuations in demand affecting sales to customers; and other matters referred to in the Company's SEC filings.
The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial expectations in the near-term include (1) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for the Company's products; (2) the impact of competitors' actions, including expansion in key markets, product offerings and pricing; (3) the

degree to which higher raw material and energy-related costs can be passed on to customers through selling price increases (and previously implemented selling price increases can be sustained), without a significant loss of volume; (4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and/or investigations, including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; and (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions.

Exhibit 99.1
     PASADENA, Calif.  January 23, 2007  Avery Dennison Corporation (NYSE:AVY) today reported net income of $101.5 million or $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter, compared with a $6.9 million or $0.07 per share loss last year. Reported results included restructuring and divestiture related charges and other items totaling $0.05 per share in 2006 and $0.99 per share in the prior year. (
See Attachment A-3: "Preliminary Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures".)
     Net of transition costs, the Company's savings in 2006 from restructuring efforts were approximately $50 million. The Company expects to realize approximately $45 million in additional savings from 2006 restructuring actions in the current year. The Company recognized restructuring charges in the fourth quarter related to 2007 actions which are expected to yield further savings.
     Net sales from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.41 billion, up approximately 3.5 percent from $1.36 billion for the same quarter last year. Organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation, was approximately 2 percent. This increase was attributable to unit volume growth and positive changes in pricing and product mix.
     The Company reported net income of $367.2 million or $3.66 per share for the full year 2006, compared with $226.4 million or $2.25 per share in the prior year. Results included restructuring and divestiture related charges and other items
 
totaling $0.12 per share in 2006 and $1.21 per share in the prior year. Net sales were $5.58 billion in 2006, compared to $5.47 billion in the previous year. (
See Attachment A-3: "Preliminary Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures".)
     "During both the fourth quarter and the full year, we increased sales and produced solid improvement in earnings, despite sluggish demand in North America. We are well positioned for 2007," said Dean A. Scarborough, president and chief executive officer of Avery Dennison. "We were particularly pleased with our expansion in emerging markets in the past year, with double-digit growth in sales and improved profitability.
     "We expect to continue to make progress in reaching our sales and operating margin objectives in 2007," Scarborough added. "Our restructuring efforts are saving the Company approximately $95 million, almost half of which will benefit 2007. We are reinvesting a portion of these savings into initiatives to drive long-term growth and productivity improvement, including development of global IT platforms to drive back office standardization and efficiency.
     "In addition, we are expanding capacity in emerging markets, including both China and India, where we see strong demand for our products and high potential for sustained, rapid growth. We are also encouraged by high demand for our new and improved products and technologies, like the heat transfer products that are contributing to growth in the Retail Information Services business," he said.

AVERY DENNISON PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (In millions, except per share amounts)
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2006 financial statement presentation.
                      
 
A-2
Avery Dennison reports financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and herein provides some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the Company's presentation of its financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company's non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring charges, asset impairments, etc.), from certain of the Company's GAAP measures, the Company believes that it is providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the Company's "core" or "underlying" operating results. These non-GAAP measures are used internally to evaluate trends in the Company's underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period.
Limitations associated with the use of the Company's non-GAAP measures include (1) the exclusion of items that recur from time to time (e.g. restructuring, asset impairment charges, gains on sales of assets, etc.) from calculations of the Company's earnings and operating margin; (2) the exclusion of interest expense from the calculation of the Company's operating margin; and (3) the exclusion of any mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do not directly or immediately support the underlying business (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash flow. While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, the Company believes that supplemental non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the assessment of the Company's performance and operating trends.
The reconciliation set forth below is provided in accordance with Regulations G and S-K and reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
